The abnormality of spatiotemporal networks in patients with MDD remains largely unclear. Methods We investigated the alterations of the global spatiotemporal network in MDD patients using a large-sample multicenter resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset. The spatiotemporal characteristics were measured by the variability of global signal (GS) and its correlation with local signals (GSCORR) at multiple frequency bands. The association between these indicators and clinical scores was further assessed. Results The GS fluctuations were reduced in patients with MDD across the full frequency range (0-0.1852 Hz). The GSCORR was also reduced in the MDD group, especially in the relatively higher frequency range (0.0728-0.1852 Hz). Interestingly, these indicators showed positive correlations with depressive scores in the MDD group and relative negative correlations in the control group. Conclusion The GS and its spatiotemporal effects on local signals were weakened in patients with MDD, which may impair inter-regional synchronization and related functions. Patients with severe depression may use the compensatory mechanism to make up for the functional impairments.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Phenotypes of subclinical psychosis (SP), such as psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) and schizotypy, present several similarities with psychosis. We aimed to examine whether SP measures varied across different sites and whether this variation was comparable with FEP incidence within the same areas. We further examined contribution of environmental and genetic factors to SP. Methods We used data from 1497 controls recruited in 16 different sites across 6 countries. Factor scores for several psychopathological dimensions of schizotypy and PLEs were obtained using multidimensional item response theory models. Variation of these scores was assessed using multi-level regression analysis to estimate individual and between-sites variance adjusting for age, sex, education, migrant, employment and relational status, childhood adversity, and cannabis use. In the final model we added local FEP incidence as a second-level variable. Association with genetic liability was examined separately. Results Schizotypy showed a large between-sites variation with up to 15% of variance attributable to site-level characteristics. Adding local FEP incidence to the model considerably reduced the between-sites unexplained schizotypy variance. PLEs did not show as much variation. Overall, SP was associated with younger age, migrant, unmarried, unemployed and less educated individuals, cannabis use, and childhood adversity. Both phenotypes were associated with genetic liability to schizophrenia. Conclusions Schizotypy showed substantial between-sites variation, being more represented in areas where FEP incidence is higher. This supports the hypothesis that shared contextual factors shape the between-sites variation of psychosis across the spectrum. Copyright 2024 © The Author(s).

Little is known about the relation between loneliness and social anxiety. This study aimed (1) to explore levels of loneliness and social anxiety in the general population, and (2) to assess whether and how loneliness affects symptoms of social anxiety and vice versa over a period of five years. Methods The study combined data from the baseline assessment and the five-year follow-up of the population-based Gutenberg Health Study. Data of N = 15 010 participants at baseline (Mage = 55.01, s.d.age = 11.10) were analyzed. Multiple regression analyses with loneliness and symptoms of social anxiety at follow-up including sociodemographic, physical illnesses, and mental health indicators at baseline were used to test relevant covariates. Effects of loneliness on symptoms of social anxiety over five years and vice versa were analyzed by autoregressive cross-lagged structural equation models. Results At baseline, 1076 participants (7.41%) showed symptoms of social anxiety and 1537 (10.48%) participants reported feelings of loneliness. Controlling for relevant covariates, symptoms of social anxiety had a small significant effect on loneliness five years later (standardized estimate of 0.164, p < 0.001). Vice versa, there was no significant effect of loneliness on symptoms of social anxiety taking relevant covariates into account. Conclusions Findings provided evidence that symptoms of social anxiety are predictive for loneliness. Thus, prevention and intervention efforts for loneliness need to address symptoms of social anxiety.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

An FEP 10-year follow-up study investigated the rate of personal recovery, emotional wellbeing, and clinical recovery in the total sample and between psychotic bipolar spectrum disorders (BD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ); and how these positive outcomes overlap. Methods FEP participants (n = 128) were re-Assessed with structured clinical interviews at 10-year follow-up. Personal recovery was self-rated with the Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery-15-item scale (total score 45). Emotional wellbeing was self-rated with the Life Satisfaction Scale (score 5) and the Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (total score 72). Clinical recovery was clinician-rated symptom-remission and adequate functioning (duration minimum 1 year). Results In FEP, rates of personal recovery (50.8%), life satisfaction (60.9%), and pleasure (57.5%) were higher than clinical recovery (33.6%). Despite lower rates of clinical recovery in SZ compared to BD, they had equal rates of personal recovery and emotional wellbeing. Personal recovery overlapped more with emotional wellbeing than with clinical recovery (χ2). Each participant was assigned to one of eight possible outcome groups depending on the combination of positive outcomes fulfilled. The eight groups collapsed into three equal-sized main outcome groups: 33.6% clinical recovery with personal recovery and/or emotional wellbeing; 34.4% personal recovery and/or emotional wellbeing only; and 32.0% none. Conclusions In FEP, 68% had minimum one positive outcome after 10 years, suggesting a good life with psychosis. This knowledge must be shared to instill hope and underlines that subjective and objective positive outcomes must be assessed and targeted in treatment.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

However, co-occurrence is common and is related to worse outcomes. This study explores prevention effects of leading school-based prevention programs on co-occurring alcohol use and psychological distress. Methods Data from two Australian cluster randomized trials involving 8576 students in 97 schools were harmonized for analysis. Students received either health education (control) or one of five prevention programs (e.g. Climate Schools, PreVenture) with assessments at baseline and 6, 12, 24, and 30 or 36 months (from ages ~13-16). Multilevel multinomial regressions were used to predict the relative risk ratios (RRs) of students reporting co-occurring early alcohol use and psychological distress, alcohol use only, distress only, or neither (reference) across programs. Results The combined Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis and Climate Schools: Mental Health courses (CSC) as well as the PreVenture program reduced the risk of adolescents reporting co-occurring alcohol use and psychological distress (36 months RRCSC = 0.37; RRPreVenture = 0.22). Other evaluated programs (excluding Climate Schools: Mental Health) only appeared effective for reducing the risk of alcohol use that occurred without distress. Conclusions Evidence-based programs exist that reduce the risk of early alcohol use with and without co-occurring psychological distress, though preventing psychological distress alone requires further exploration. Prevention programs appear to have different effects depending on whether alcohol use and distress present on their own or together, thus suggesting the need for tailored prevention strategies.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Previous research has indicated aberrant levels of inflammatory markers and growth factors in AN, which in other populations have been shown to influence hippocampal integrity. Methods Here we investigated the influence of concentrations of two pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α] and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on the whole hippocampal volume, as well as the volumes of three regions (the hippocampal body, head, and tail) and 18 subfields bilaterally. Investigations occurred both cross-sectionally between acutely underweight adolescent/young adult females with AN (acAN; n = 82) and people recovered from AN (recAN; n = 20), each independently pairwise age-matched with healthy controls (HC), and longitudinally in acAN after partial renourishment (n = 58). Hippocampal subfield volumes were quantified using FreeSurfer. Concentrations of molecular factors were analyzed in linear models with hippocampal (subfield) volumes as the dependent variable. Results Cross-sectionally, there was no evidence for an association between IL-6, TNF-α, or BDNF and between-group differences in hippocampal subfield volumes. Longitudinally, increasing concentrations of BDNF were positively associated with longitudinal increases in bilateral global hippocampal volumes after controlling for age, age2, estimated total intracranial volume, and increases in body mass index (BMI). Conclusions These findings suggest that increases in BDNF may contribute to global hippocampal recovery over and above increases in BMI during renourishment. Investigations into treatments targeted toward increasing BDNF in AN may be warranted.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Computational work indicates that both surprising outcomes (prediction errors; PEs) and outcomes (values) themselves drive emotional responses, but neither has been consistently linked to affective disturbances in depression. As a result, the computational mechanisms driving emotional abnormalities in depression remain unknown. Methods Here, in 687 individuals, one-third of whom qualify as depressed via a standard self-report measure (the PHQ-9), we use high-stakes, naturalistic events - the reveal of midterm exam grades - to test whether individuals with heightened depression display a specific reduction in emotional response to positive PEs. Results Using Bayesian mixed effects models, we find that individuals with heightened depression do not affectively benefit from surprising, good outcomes - that is, they display reduced affective responses to positive PEs. These results were highly specific: effects were not observed to negative PEs, value signals (grades), and were not related to generalized anxiety. This suggests that the computational drivers of abnormalities in emotion in depression may be specifically due to positive PE-based emotional responding. Conclusions Affective abnormalities are core depression symptoms, but the computational mechanisms underlying such differences are unknown. This work suggests that blunted affective reactions to positive PEs are likely mechanistic drivers of emotional dysregulation in depression. © The Author(s), 2024.

The current study investigated the longitudinal effects of SLEs on functioning and symptom severity in CHR individuals, where we hypothesized CHR would report more SLEs than healthy controls (HC), and SLEs would be associated with poorer outcomes. Methods The study used longitudinal data from the EU-GEI High Risk study. Data from 331 CHR participants were analyzed to examine the effects of SLEs on changes in functioning, positive and negative symptoms over a 2-year follow-up. We compared the prevalence of SLEs between CHR and HCs, and between CHR who did (CHR-T) and did not (CHR-NT) transition to psychosis. Results CHR reported 1.44 more SLEs than HC (p < 0.001), but there was no difference in SLEs between CHR-T and CHR-NT at baseline. Recent SLEs were associated with poorer functioning and more severe positive and negative symptoms in CHR individuals (all p < 0.01) but did not reveal a significant interaction with time. Conclusions CHR individuals who had experienced recent SLEs exhibited poorer functioning and more severe symptoms. However, as the interaction between SLEs and time was not significant, this suggests SLEs did not contribute to a worsening of symptoms and functioning over the study period. SLEs could be a key risk factor to becoming CHR for psychosis, however further work is required to inform when early intervention strategies mitigating against the effects of stress are most effective.

The impact of social fragmentation and friendships on distressing psychotic-like experiences (PLE) remains unknown. We investigate the relationships between neighborhood social fragmentation, number of friends, and distressing PLE among early adolescents. Methods Data were collected from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Generalized linear mixed models tested associations between social fragmentation and distressing PLE, as well as the moderating role of the number of total and close friends. Results Participants included 11 133 adolescents aged 9 to 10, with 52.3% being males. Greater neighborhood social fragmentation was associated with higher levels of distressing PLE (adjusted β = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01-0.09). The number of close but not total friends significantly interacted with social fragmentation to predict distressing PLE (adjusted β =-0.02; 95% CI:-0.04 to <-0.01). Among those with fewer close friends, the association between neighborhood social fragmentation and distressing PLE was significant (adjusted β = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.03-0.11). However, among those with more close friends, the association was non-significant (adjusted β = 0.03; 95% CI:-0.01 to 0.07). Conclusions Greater neighborhood social fragmentation is associated with higher levels of distressing PLE, particularly among those with fewer close friends. Further research is needed to disentangle aspects of the interaction between neighborhood characteristics and the quality of social interactions that may contribute to psychosis, which would have implications for developing effective interventions at the individual and community levels.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

While often studied in family designs, few studies and none with genetic measures, have examined SPD in epidemiological samples. Methods We studied individuals born in Sweden 1940-2000 with an ICD-10 diagnosis of SPD with no prior schizophrenia (SZ) diagnosis (n = 2292). Demographic features, patterns of comorbidity, and Family Genetic Risk Scores (FGRS) were assessed from multiple Swedish registries. Prediction of progression to SZ was assessed by Cox models. Results SPD was rare, with a prevalence of 0.044%, and had high levels of comorbidity with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), OCD, ADHD, and major depression (MD), and increased rates of being single, unemployed and in receipt of welfare. Affected individuals had elevated levels of FGRS for SZ (+0.42), ASD (+0.30), MD (+0.29), and ADHD (+0.20). Compared to cases of schizophrenia, they had significantly lower rates of FGRSSZ, but significantly elevated rates of genetic risk for ASD, MD, and ADHD. Over a mean follow-up of 8.7 years, 14.6% of SPD cases received a first diagnosis of SZ, the risk for which was significantly increased by levels of FGRSSZ, male sex, young age at SPD diagnosis and an in-patient SPD diagnosis and significantly decreased by comorbidity with MD, ASD, and ADHD. Conclusions Our results not only support the designation of SPD as a schizophrenia spectrum disorder but also suggest potentially important etiologic links between SPD and ASD and, to a lesser extent, ADHD, OCD, and MD.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Methods We used data (n = 55) from our recent double-blind, parallel-group, randomized head-to-head comparison trial of escitalopram and investigational drug, COMP360, psilocybin. Mixed linear models were used to investigate the association between pre-treatment efficacy-related expectations, as well as baseline trait suggestibility and absorption, and therapeutic response to both escitalopram and COMP360 psilocybin. Results Patients had significantly higher expectancy for psilocybin relative to escitalopram; however, expectancy for escitalopram was associated with improved therapeutic outcomes to escitalopram, expectancy for psilocybin was not predictive of response to psilocybin. Separately, we found that pre-treatment trait suggestibility was associated with therapeutic response in the psilocybin arm, but not in the escitalopram arm. Conclusions Overall, our results suggest that psychedelic therapy may be less vulnerable to expectancy biases than previously suspected.

However, such models fail to account for relationships among individual measures of cognition and EAP, thereby limiting their utility. Hence, EAP and cognition may function as complementary and interacting measures of brain function rather than independent stages of information processing. Here, we apply a data-driven approach to identifying directional relationships among neurophysiologic and cognitive variables. Methods Using data from the Consortium on the Genetics of Schizophrenia 2, we estimated Gaussian Graphical Models and Bayesian networks to examine undirected and directed connections between measures of EAP, including mismatch negativity and P3a, and cognition in 663 outpatients with schizophrenia and 630 control participants. Results Chain structures emerged among EAP and attention/vigilance measures in schizophrenia and control groups. Concerning differences between the groups, object memory was an influential variable in schizophrenia upon which other cognitive domains depended, and working memory was an influential variable in controls. Conclusions Measures of EAP and attention/vigilance are conditionally independent of other cognitive domains that were used in this study. Findings also revealed additional causal assumptions among measures of cognition that could help guide statistical control and ultimately help identify early-stage targets or surrogate endpoints in schizophrenia.

The Honest, Open, Proud (HOP) program shows promise in reducing stigma but there is uncertainty about the feasibility of a randomized trial to evaluate a peer-delivered, individual adaptation of HOP for psychosis (Let's Talk). Methods A multi-site, Prospective Randomized Open Blinded Evaluation (PROBE) design, feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing the peer-delivered intervention (Let's Talk) to treatment as usual (TAU). Follow-up was 2.5 and 6 months. Randomization was via a web-based system, with permuted blocks of random size. Up to 10 sessions of the intervention over 10 weeks were offered. The primary outcome was feasibility data (recruitment, retention, intervention attendance). Primary outcomes were analyzed by intention to treat. Safety outcomes were reported by as treated status. The study was prospectively registered: https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN17197043. Results 149 patients were referred to the study and 70 were recruited. 35 were randomly assigned to intervention + TAU and 35 to TAU. Recruitment was 93% of the target sample size. Retention rate was high (81% at 2.5 months primary endpoint), and intervention attendance rate was high (83%). 21% of 33 patients in Let's talk + TAU had an adverse event and 16% of 37 patients in TAU. One serious adverse event (pre-randomization) was partially related and expected. Conclusions This is the first trial to show that it is feasible and safe to conduct a RCT of HOP adapted for people with psychosis and individual delivery. An adequately powered trial is required to provide robust evidence.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Elucidating the neural mechanisms of AN is necessary to identify novel treatment targets and improve outcomes. A growing body of literature points to a role for dorsal fronto-striatal circuitry in the pathophysiology of AN, with increasing evidence of abnormal task-based fMRI activation within this network among patients with AN. Whether these abnormalities are present at rest and reflect fundamental differences in brain organization is unclear. Methods The current study combined resting-state fMRI data from patients with AN (n = 89) and healthy controls (HC; n = 92) across four studies, removing site effects using ComBat harmonization. First, the a priori hypothesis that dorsal fronto-striatal connectivity strength-specifically between the anterior caudate and dlPFC-differed between patients and HC was tested using seed-based functional connectivity analysis with small-volume correction. To assess specificity of effects, exploratory analyses examined anterior caudate whole-brain connectivity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), and node centrality. Results Compared to HC, patients showed significantly reduced right, but not left, anterior caudate-dlPFC connectivity (p = 0.002) in small-volume corrected analyses. Whole-brain analyses also identified reduced connectivity between the right anterior caudate and left superior frontal and middle frontal gyri (p = 0.028) and increased connectivity between the right anterior caudate and right occipital cortex (p = 0.038). No group differences were found in analyses of anterior caudate ALFF and node centrality. Conclusions Decreased coupling of dorsal fronto-striatal regions indicates that circuit-based abnormalities persist at rest and suggests this network may be a potential treatment target.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

It remains unclear whether these symptoms are related to similar or dissociable brain networks. This study used resting-state fMRI to disentangle networks associated with fatigue and pain symptoms in ME/CFS patients, and to link changes in those networks to clinical improvements following cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Methods Relationships between pain and fatigue symptoms and cortico-cortical connectivity were assessed within ME/CFS patients at baseline (N = 72) and after CBT (N = 33) and waiting list (WL, N = 18) and compared to healthy controls (HC, N = 29). The analyses focused on four networks previously associated with pain and/or fatigue, i.e. the fronto-parietal network (FPN), premotor network (PMN), somatomotor network (SMN), and default mode network (DMN). Results At baseline, variation in pain and fatigue symptoms related to partially dissociable brain networks. Fatigue was associated with higher SMN-PMN connectivity and lower SMN-DMN connectivity. Pain was associated with lower PMN-DMN connectivity. CBT improved SMN-DMN connectivity, compared to WL. Larger clinical improvements were associated with larger increases in frontal SMN-DMN connectivity. No CBT effects were observed for PMN-DMN or SMN-PMN connectivity. Conclusions These results provide insight into the dissociable neural mechanisms underlying fatigue and pain symptoms in ME/CFS and how they are affected by CBT in successfully treated patients.

Social determinants of psychosis and PLEs are important and have been operationalized within the social defeat (SD) hypothesis. The SD hypothesis posits that low social status and exposure to repeated humiliation can lead to imbalanced dopamine neuron activity, and thus increased risk of psychosis. We aimed to assess the role of dynamic interactions between SD components in shaping the occurrence of PLEs using a network analysis. Methods A total of 2241 non-clinical, young adults were assessed at baseline and invited for reassessment after a 6-month follow-up. Self-reports recording the occurrence of PLEs, aberrant salience (AS), depressive, and anxiety symptoms as well as SD characteristics (socioeconomic status, minority status, humiliation, perceived constraints, and domain control) were administered. Two networks were analyzed (the first one covering all baseline measures and the second one with the baseline SD components and follow-up measures of AS and psychopathology). Results The SD components were not directly connected to the measures of PLEs in both networks. However, in both networks, SD components were connected to PLEs through a mediating effect of AS. Among SD components, humiliation had the highest bridge centrality across three predefined communities of variables (SD; depressive and anxiety symptoms; AS, and PLEs). Conclusions The findings indicate that SD might make individuals vulnerable to develop PLEs through the mediating effects of AS. Among SD components, humiliation might play the most important role in the development of PLEs.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2025.","Article","Scopus"

DS-CBT resulted in better outcomes on several secondary trial outcome measures at the 12-month follow-up point. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate putative treatment mechanisms. Methods We carried out a secondary mediation analysis of the CODES trial. 368 participants were recruited from the National Health Service in secondary / tertiary care in England, Scotland, and Wales. Sixteen mediation hypotheses corresponding to combinations of important trial outcomes and putative mediators were assessed. Twelve-month trial outcomes considered were final-month seizure frequency, Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the SF-12v2, a quality-of-life measure providing physical (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. Mediators chosen for analysis at six months (broadly corresponding to completion of DS-CBT) included: (a) beliefs about emotions, (b) a measure of avoidance behavior, (c) anxiety and (d) depression. Results All putative mediator variables except beliefs about emotions were found to be improved by DS-CBT. We found evidence for DS-CBT effect mediation for the outcome variables dissociative seizures (DS), WSAS and SF-12v2 MCS scores by improvements in target variables avoidance behavior, anxiety, and depression. The only variable to mediate the DS-CBT effect on the SF-12v2 PCS score was avoidance behavior. Conclusions Our findings largely confirmed the logic model underlying the development of CBT for patients with DS. Interventions could be additionally developed to specifically address beliefs about emotions to assess whether it improves outcomes. Copyright 2024 © The Author(s).

However, cost and workforce capacity limit wide-scale uptake of DBT since it involves over 20 in-person sessions with a trained professional (and six sessions for guided self-help format). Interventions translated for delivery through modern technology offer a solution to increase the accessibility of evidence-based treatments. We developed the first DBT-specific skills training smartphone application (Resilience: eDBT) for binge-spectrum eating disorders and evaluated its efficacy in a randomized clinical trial. Method Participants reporting recurrent binge eating were randomized to Resilience (n = 287) or a waitlist (n = 289). Primary outcomes were objective binge eating episodes and global levels of eating disorder psychopathology. Secondary outcomes were behavioral and cognitive symptoms, psychological distress, and the hypothesized processes of change (mindfulness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance). Results Intention-To-Treat analyses showed that the intervention group reported greater reductions in objective binge eating episodes (incidence rate ratio = 0.69) and eating disorder psychopathology (d =-0.68) than the waitlist at 6 weeks. Significant group differences favoring the intervention group were also observed on secondary outcomes, except for subjective binge eating, psychological distress, and distress tolerance. Primary symptoms showed further improvements from 6 to 12 weeks. However, dropout rate was high (48%) among the intervention group, and engagement decreased over the study period. Conclusion A novel, low-intensity DBT skills training app can effectively reduce symptoms of eating disorders. Scalable apps like these may increase the accessibility of evidence-based treatments.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Increasing evidence suggests a role for the limbic network (LN) and the triple network model in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder (BD). However, the specific relationship between the LN and the triple network in PBD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the aberrant causal connections among these four core networks in PBD. Method Resting-state functional MRI scans from 92 PBD patients and 40 healthy controls (HCs) were analyzed. Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) was employed to assess effective connectivity (EC) among the four core networks. Parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) analysis was conducted to identify ECs associated with group differences, as well as depression and mania severity. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to test predictive accuracy. Result Compared to HCs, PBD patients exhibited primarily excitatory bottom-up connections from the LN to the salience network (SN) and bidirectional excitatory connections between the default mode network (DMN) and SN. In PBD, top-down connectivity from the triple network to the LN was excitatory in individuals with higher depression severity but inhibitory in those with higher mania severity. LOOCV identified dysconnectivity circuits involving the caudate and hippocampus as being associated with mania and depression severity, respectively. Conclusions Disrupted bottom-up connections from the LN to the triple network distinguish PBD patients from healthy controls, while top-down disruptions from the triple network to LN relate to mood state differences. These findings offer insight into the neural mechanisms of PBD.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

The recently developed Revised Green et al., Paranoid Thoughts Scale (R-GPTS) constitutes an easy to administer self-report assessment of mild ideas of reference and more severe persecutory thoughts. Moreover, it comes with clinical cut-offs for increased usability in research and clinical practice. With multiple translations of the R-GPTS already available and in use, a formal test of its measurement invariance is now needed. Methods Using data from a multinational cross-sectional online survey in the UK, USA, Australia, Germany, and Hong Kong (N = 2510), we performed confirmatory factory analyses on the R-GPTS and tested for measurement invariance across sites. Results We found sufficient fit for the two-factor structure (ideas of reference, persecutory thoughts) of the R-GPTS across cultures. Measurement invariance was found for the persecutory thoughts subscale, indicating that it does measure the same construct across the tested samples in the same way. For ideas of reference, we found no scalar invariance, which was traced back to (mostly higher) item intercepts in the Hong Kong sample. Conclusion We found sufficient invariance for the persecutory thoughts scale, which is of substantial practical importance, as it is used for the screening of clinical paranoia. A direct comparison of the ideas of reference sum-scores between cultures, however, may lead to an over-estimation of these milder forms of paranoia in some (non-western) cultures. © The Author(s), 2024.

However, little is known about the age at which adolescents benefit from early intervention. This study investigated whether age affects the effectiveness of early intervention for BPD. Methods N = 626 participants (M age = 15 years, 82.7% female) were consecutively recruited from a specialized outpatient service for early intervention in BPD in adolescents aged 12- to 17-years old. DSM-IV BPD criteria were assessed at baseline, one-year (n = 339) and two-year (n = 279) follow-up. Results Older adolescents presented with more BPD criteria (χ2 (1) = 58.23, p < 0.001) and showed a steeper decline of BPD criteria over the 2-year follow-up period compared with younger adolescents (χ2 (2) = 13.53, p = 0.001). In an attempt to disentangle effects of early intervention from the natural course of BPD, a parametrized regression model was used. An exponential decrease (b = 0.10, p < 0.001) in BPD criteria was found when starting therapy over the 2-year follow-up. This deviation from the natural course was impacted by age at therapy commencement (b = 0.06, p < 0.001), although significant across all ages: older adolescents showed a clear decrease in BPD criteria, and young adolescents a smaller decrease. Conclusions Early intervention appears effective across adolescence, but manifests differently: preventing the normative increase of BPD pathology expected in younger adolescents, and significantly decreasing BPD pathology in older adolescents. The question as to whether developmentally adapted therapeutic interventions could lead to an even increased benefit for younger adolescents, should be explored in future studies. © The Author(s), 2024.

This challenge may, in part, stem from the intertwined state (current symptoms; variable) and trait (general propensity; stable) experiences of depression. Here, we sought to disentangle state from trait experiences of depression by leveraging a longitudinal cohort and stratifying individuals into four groups: those in remission ('trait depression group'), those with large longitudinal severity changes in depression symptomatology ('state depression group'), and their respective matched control groups (total analytic n = 1030). We hypothesized that spatial network organization would be linked to trait depression due to its temporal stability, whereas functional connectivity between networks would be more sensitive to state-dependent depression symptoms due to its capacity to fluctuate. We identified 15 large-scale probabilistic functional networks from resting-state fMRI data and performed group comparisons on the amplitude, connectivity, and spatial overlap between these networks, using matched control participants as reference. Our findings revealed higher amplitude in visual networks for the trait depression group at the time of remission, in contrast to controls. This observation may suggest altered visual processing in individuals predisposed to developing depression over time. No significant group differences were observed in any other network measures for the trait-control comparison, nor in any measures for the state-control comparison. These results underscore the overlooked contribution of visual networks to the psychopathology of depression and provide evidence for distinct neural correlates between state and trait experiences of depression.

Eligible studies were identified by a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, PsyclNFO, PTSDpubs, and CENTRAL. The target population was adults with above-threshold baseline PTSD symptoms. Trials were eligible if at least 70% of study participants had been diagnosed with PTSD using a structured clinical interview. Primary outcomes included PTSD symptom severity, treatment response, and PTSD remission. Treatment dropout was a secondary outcome. The systematic search retrieved 15 eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs); 8 of these 15 were able to be included in this IPDMA (346 patients). Comparator treatments included relaxation therapy, emotional freedom technique, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral psychotherapies, and REM-desensitization. Results One-stage IPDMA found no significant difference between EMDR and other psychological treatments in reducing PTSD symptom severity (β = -0.24), achieving response (β = 0.86), attaining remission (β = 1.05), or reducing treatment dropout rates (β = -0.25). Moderator analyses found unemployed participants receiving EMDR had higher PTSD symptom severity at the post-test, and males were more likely to drop out of EMDR treatment than females.

However, few studies have examined cognitive and behavioral constructs that may maintain or worsen these changes. Several small studies link rumination with premenstrual negative affect, with authors concluding that a tendency to ruminate amplifies and perpetuates hormone-sensitive affective symptoms. Replication in larger samples is needed to confirm the validity of rumination as a treatment target. Method 190 cycling individuals (M = 30.82 years; 61.1% Caucasian) were recruited for moderate perceived stress, a risk factor for cyclical symptoms. They completed the Rumination Response Scale at baseline, then reported daily affective and physical symptoms across 1-6 cycles. Multilevel growth models tested trait rumination as a predictor of baseline levels, luteal increases, and follicular decreases in symptoms. Results The degree of affective cyclicity was normally distributed across a substantial range, supporting feasibility of hypothesis tests and validating the concept of dimensional hormone sensitivity. Contrary to prediction, higher brooding did not predict levels or cyclical changes of any symptom. In a subsample selected for luteal increases in negative affect, brooding predicted higher baseline negative affect but still did not predict affective cyclicity. Conclusions An individual's trait-like propensity to engage in rumination may not be a valid treatment target in premenstrual mood disorders. State-like changes in rumination should still be further explored, and well-powered prospective studies should explore other cognitive and behavioral factors to inform development of targeted psychological treatments for patients with cyclical affective symptoms.  © The Author(s), 2024.

Results Within-individual variability in mother-to-infant bonding, especially anger and rejection, significantly predicted subsequent postpartum depressive symptoms. However, the inverse relationship was not significant. Additionally, prenatal depressive symptoms and difficult infant temperament were associated with greater within-individual variability in impaired mother-to-infant bonding and postpartum depressive symptoms. Conclusions The present study demonstrated that the within-individual relationship between mother-to-infant bonding and postpartum depressive symptoms is likely non-bidirectional. The significance of the findings is underscored by the potential for interventions aimed at improving mother-to-infant bonding to alleviate postpartum depressive symptoms, suggesting avenues for future research and practice.

These inconsistencies may in part be due to differences in the measurement and operationalization of alcohol use and emotional problems across studies, as well as confounder selection and missing data decisions. This study explores the associations between common specifications of adolescent alcohol use and emotional problems in a large sample of adolescents. Methods A multiverse analysis (also known as specification curve analysis or vibration of effects) was done with 7680 unique model specifications in a large longitudinal sample of 6639 Australian adolescents (aged ~14.7-15.7, 2021-2022). Results While alcohol use and emotional problems nearly universally co-occurred in minimally adjusted cross-sectional models (98-99%), the operationalization of emotional problems, temporality of prospective relationships, and choice of confounders substantially impacted findings. Emotional problems appeared to predict later alcohol use more-so than the reverse, depression-focused measures yielded more consistent associations with alcohol use than anxiety-focused measures, and certain confounders (i.e. conduct, ADHD, smoking) explained most of the associations between adolescent alcohol use and emotional problems. Missing data decisions and whether outcomes were modelled continuously v. dichotomously had minimal impact on findings. Conclusions While adolescent alcohol use and emotional problems commonly co-occur, inconsistencies in the magnitude, direction, and significance of effects are closely tied to researcher decisions that are often made arbitrarily.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

There is growing awareness that neuropathological processes associated with a disease fail to map to a specific brain region but do map to a specific brain network. We sought to investigate brain structural damage networks across different stages of schizophrenia. Methods We initially identified gray matter alterations in 523 cHR, 855 gHR, 2162 FES, and 2640 ChS individuals relative to 6963 healthy controls. By applying novel functional connectivity network mapping to large-scale discovery and validation resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets, we mapped these affected brain locations to four specific networks. Results Brain structural damage networks of cHR and gHR had limited and non-overlapping spatial distributions, with the former mainly involving the frontoparietal network and the latter principally implicating the subcortical network, indicative of distinct neuropathological mechanisms underlying cHR and gHR. By contrast, brain structural damage networks of FES and ChS manifested as similar patterns of widespread brain areas predominantly involving the somatomotor, ventral attention, and subcortical networks, suggesting an emergence of more prominent brain structural abnormalities with illness onset that have trait-like stability over time. Conclusions Our findings may not only provide a refined picture of schizophrenia neuropathology from a network perspective, but also potentially contribute to more targeted and effective intervention strategies for individuals at different schizophrenia stages.

Methods Data were obtained from a cross-sectional study encompassing 37 688 participants across three generations from the general population. ADHD subdomains, ASD subdomains, aggressive behavior, depression, anxiety, and substance use were assessed. To evaluate familial (co-)aggregation, recurrence risk ratios (λR) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. The (shared) familiality (f2), which is closely related to (shared) heritability, was assessed using residual maximum likelihood-based variance decomposition methods. All analyses were adjusted for sex, age, and age2. Results The familial aggregation and familiality of neurodevelopmental problems were moderate (λR = 2.40-4.04; f2 = 0.22-0.39). The familial co-aggregation and shared familiality among neurodevelopmental problems (λR = 1.39-2.56; rF = 0.52-0.94), and with aggressive behavior (λR = 1.79-2.56; rF = 0.60-0.78), depression (λR = 1.45-2.29; rF = 0.43-0.76), and anxiety (λR = 1.44-2.31; rF = 0.62-0.84) were substantial. The familial co-aggregation and shared familiality between all neurodevelopmental problems and all types of substance use were weak (λR = 0.53-1.57; rF = -0.06-0.35). Conclusions Neurodevelopmental problems belonging to the same disorder were more akin than cross-disorder problems. That said, there is a clear (shared) familial component to neurodevelopmental problems, in part shared with other psychiatric problems (except for substance use). This suggests that neurodevelopmental disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, and internalizing disorders share genetic and environmental risk factors. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

However, the AMPD is not yet widely used clinically. One clinician concern may be caseness - that the new model will diagnose a different set of PD patients from that with which they are familiar. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether this concern is valid, by testing how well the two models converge in terms of prevalence and coverage. Method Participants were 305 psychiatric outpatients and 302 community residents not currently in mental-health treatment who scored above threshold on the Iowa Personality Disorder Screen (Langbehn et al., 1999). Participants were administered a semi-structured interview for DSM-5 PD, which was scored for both Section II and III PDs. Results Convergence across the two PD models was variable for specific PDs, Good when specific PDs were aggregated, and Very Good for 'any PD.' Conclusions Results provide strong evidence that the AMPD yields the same overall prevalence of PD as the current model and, further, identifies largely the same overall population. It also addresses well-known problems of the current model, is more consistent with the ICD-11 PD model, and provides more complete, individualized characterizations of persons with PD, thereby offering multiple reasons for its implementation in clinical settings.

Long-term cognitive and behavioral outcomes as well as underlying structural brain alterations following pediatric mTBI have yet to be determined. In addition, the effect of age-at-injury on long-term outcomes is largely unknown. Methods Children with a history of mTBI (n = 406; Mage = 10 years, SDage = 0.63 years) who participated in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study were matched (1:2 ratio) with typically developing children (TDC; n = 812) and orthopedic injury (OI) controls (n = 812). Task-based executive functioning, parent-rated executive functioning and emotion-regulation, and self-reported impulsivity were assessed cross-sectionally. Regression models were used to examine the effect of mTBI on these domains. The effect of age-at-injury was assessed by comparing children with their first mTBI at either 0-3, 4-7, or 8-10 years to the respective matched TDC controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), both MRI-based measures of white matter microstructure, were compared between children with mTBI and controls. Results Children with a history of mTBI displayed higher parent-rated executive dysfunction, higher impulsivity, and poorer self-regulation compared to both control groups. At closer investigation, these differences to TDC were only present in one respective age-at-injury group. No alterations were found in task-based executive functioning or white matter microstructure. Conclusions Findings suggest that everyday executive function, impulsivity, and emotion-regulation are affected years after pediatric mTBI. Outcomes were specific to the age at which the injury occurred, suggesting that functioning is differently affected by pediatric mTBI during vulnerable periods. Groups did not differ in white matter microstructure. © The Author(s), 2024. ","Article","Scopus"

Methods We identified people with severe mental illness (SMI) and depression, respectively, using Japanese claim data of Ibaraki prefecture during 1/1/2014-31/12/2021. We conducted self-controlled case series to estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of heat-related illness, myocardial infarction and delirium, respectively, during 5-day pre-heatwave, heatwave, and 5-day post-heatwave periods v. all other periods (baseline) within an individual, stratified by periods prescribed psychotropics and periods not prescribed psychotropics, respectively. Results Among people with SMI, heatwave was associated with an increased rate of heat-related illness v. baseline, with no evidence of a difference in the IRRs between those prescribed v. not prescribed antipsychotics (IRR: 1.48 [95% CI 1.40-1.56]; 1.45 [95% CI 1.35-1.56] respectively, p interaction: 0.53). Among people with depression, heatwave was similarly associated with heat-related illness, with no evidence of a difference in the IRRs between those prescribed v. not prescribed antidepressants (IRR: 1.54 [95% CI 1.46-1.64]; 1.64 [95% CI 1.57-1.71] respectively, p interaction: 0.33). Smaller increased rates of heat-related illness were also observed in pre-and post-heatwave periods, v. baseline in both cohorts. There was weak evidence of an increased risk of MI and delirium associated with heatwave v. baseline. Conclusions We showed an increased risk of heat-related illness, myocardial infarction and delirium associated with heatwave in people with mental health conditions regardless of whether being prescribed psychotropics.

However, few have used analytic strategies that capture the interplay of these experiences and their relation to PTSD. The current study used a person-centered statistical approach to examine heterogeneity in trauma and contextual stress exposure, and their associations with PTSD and underlying symptom dimensions, in a diverse sample of low-income postpartum women. Methods Using a community-based sample of Black, Hispanic/Latina, and White postpartum women recruited from five U.S. regions (n = 1577), a latent class analysis generated profiles of past-year exposure to traumatic events and contextual stress at one month postpartum. Regression analyses then examined associations between class membership and PTSD symptom severity at six months postpartum as a function of race/ethnicity. Results A four-class solution best fit the data, yielding High Contextual Stress, Injury/Illness, Violence Exposure, and Low Trauma/Contextual Stress classes. Compared to the Low Trauma/Contextual Stress class, membership in any of the other classes was associated with greater symptom severity across nearly all PTSD symptom dimensions (all ps < 0.05). Additionally, constellations of exposures were differentially linked to total PTSD symptom severity, reexperiencing, and numbing PTSD symptoms across racial/ethnic groups (ps < 0.05). Conclusions A person-centered approach to trauma and contextual stress exposure can capture heterogeneity of experiences in diverse, low-income women. Moreover, racially/ethnically patterned links between traumatic or stressful exposures and PTSD symptom dimensions have implications for screening and intervention in the perinatal period.

Increased AR of mood scores has been reported to anticipate depressive episodes in major depressive disorder, while other studies found AR increases to be associated with depressive episodes themselves. Data on AR in patients with bipolar disorders (BD) is limited and inconclusive. Methods Patients with BD reported their current mood via daily e-diaries for 12 months. Current affective status (euthymic, prodromal, depressed, (hypo)manic) was assessed in 26 bi-weekly expert interviews. Exploratory analyses tested whether self-reported current mood and AR of the same item could differentiate between prodromal phases or affective episodes and euthymia. Results A total of 29 depressive and 20 (hypo)manic episodes were observed in 29 participants with BD. Self-reported current mood was significantly decreased during the two weeks prior to a depressive episode (early prodromal, late prodromal), but not changed prior to manic episodes. The AR was neither a significant predictor for the early or late prodromal phase of depression nor for the early prodromal phase of (hypo)mania. Decreased AR was found in the late prodromal phase of (hypo)mania. Increased AR was mainly found during depressive episodes. Conclusions AR changes might not be better at predicting depressive episodes than simple self-report measures on current mood in patients with BD.

Supportive school environments may serve as a protective factor during crises like COVID-19, which disrupt social lives and worsen adolescent mental health. This is the first study examining whether the pandemic effects differed based on the levels of school climate on depressive symptoms (DS) and psychotic experiences (PEs) among adolescents. Methods School climate (score range: 0-28), DS (0-26), and PEs (0-5) were self-reported in a population-based cohort (Tokyo Teen Cohort; N = 3171) at four timepoints (10y, 12y, 14y, and 16y) before and during COVID-19. COVID-19 occurred midway through the 16y survey, allowing us to examine its impact and interaction effect with school climate while accounting for within-person changes over time using mixed-effects models.

The pandemic effects were not significant for adolescents with high school climate scores (around the 80th percentile or higher), although the pandemic significantly worsened these outcomes among the overall sample. Conclusions The negative mental health effects of the pandemic were significantly mitigated among adolescents experiencing a supportive school climate. A positive school climate can protect adolescent mental health during challenging social conditions, such as pandemics. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

IPS was implemented for young adults at a municipality level through a cross-sectoral collaboration between specialist mental healthcare, primary mental healthcare, and the government funded employment service (NAV). We investigated whether IPS implementation had a causal effect on employment outcomes for all young adults in receipt of a temporary health-related rehabilitation (work assessment allowance, WAA) welfare benefit, measured at the societal level compared to municipalities that did not implement IPS. Method We used a difference in differences design to estimate the effects of IPS implementation on the outcome of workdays per year using longitudinal registry data. We estimate the average effect of being exposed to IPS implementation during four-years of implementation compared to ten control municipalities without IPS for all WAA recipients. Results We found a significant, positive, causal effect on societal level employment outcomes of 5.6 (p = 0.001, 95% CI 2.7-8.4) increased workdays per year per individual, equivalent to 12.7 years of increased work in the municipality where IPS was implemented compared to municipalities without IPS. Three years after initial exposure to IPS implementation individuals worked, on average, 10.5 more days per year equating to 23.8 years of increased work. Conclusions Implementing IPS as a cross sectoral collaboration at a municipality level has a significant, positive, causal, societal impact on employment outcomes for all young adults in receipt of a temporary health-related rehabilitation welfare benefit.  © The Author(s), 2024.

Methods MD and AUD registrations were assessed from national Swedish registries. In individuals born in Sweden 1960-1970, we identified 7586, 388 459, and 34 370 with the loss of, respectively, a spouse, parent, and sibling. We started following subjects at age 18 or the year 2002 with end of follow-up in 2018. We examined time to event - a registration for MD within 6 months or AUD within a year - on an additive scale, using the Nelson-Aalen estimator. Genetic risk was assessed by the Family Genetic Risk Score (FGRS). Results In separate models controlling for the main effects of death of spouse, parent, and sibling, FGRS, and sex, significant interactions were seen in all analyses between genetic risk for MD and death of relative in prediction of subsequent MD registration. A similar pattern of results, albeit with weaker interaction effects, was seen for genetic risk for AUD and risk for AUD registration. Genetic risk for bipolar disorder (BD) and anxiety disorders (AD) also interacted with event exposure in predicting MD. Conclusions Genetic risk for both MD and AUD act in part by increasing the sensitivity of individuals to the pathogenic effects of environmental stressors. For prediction of MD, similar effects are also seen for genetic risk for AD and BD. Copyright 2024 © The Author(s). Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We aimed to identify overlapping and medication-specific brain functional mechanisms of psychostimulants and nonstimulants on ADHD. Methods After a systematic literature search and database construction, the imputed maps of separate and pooled neuropharmacological mechanisms were meta-Analyzed by Seed-based d Mapping toolbox, followed by large-scale network analysis to uncover potential coactivation patterns and meta-regression analysis to examine the modulatory effects of age and sex. Results Twenty-eight whole-brain task-based functional MRI studies (396 cases in the medication group and 459 cases in the control group) were included. Possible normalization effects of stimulant and nonstimulant administration converged on increased activation patterns of the left supplementary motor area (Z = 1.21, p < 0.0001, central executive network). Stimulants, relative to nonstimulants, increased brain activations in the left amygdala (Z = 1.30, p = 0.0006), middle cingulate gyrus (Z = 1.22, p = 0.0008), and superior frontal gyrus (Z = 1.27, p = 0.0006), which are within the ventral attention network. Neurodevelopmental trajectories emerged in activation patterns of the right supplementary motor area and left amygdala, with the left amygdala also presenting a sex-related difference. Conclusions Convergence in the left supplementary motor area may delineate novel therapeutic targets for effective interventions, and distinct neural substrates could account for different therapeutic responses to stimulants and nonstimulants.  © The Author(s), 2025.","Article","Scopus"

This study aimed to identify the neurophysiologic basis underlying the association between visual WM and auditory processing function in children with ADHD. Methods The participants included 86 children with ADHD (aged 6-15 years, mean age 9.66 years, 70 boys, and 16 girls) and 90 typically developing (TD) children (aged 7-16 years, mean age 10.30 years, 66 boys, and 24 girls). Electroencephalograms were recorded from all participants while they performed an auditory discrimination task (oddball task). The visual WM capacity and ADHD symptom severity were measured for all participants. Results Compared with TD children, children with ADHD presented a poorer visual WM capacity and a smaller mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude. Notably, the smaller MMN amplitude in children with ADHD predicted a less impaired WM capacity and milder inattention symptom severity. In contrast, the larger MMN amplitude in TD children predicted a better visual WM capacity. Conclusions Our results suggest an intimate relationship and potential shared mechanism between visual WM and auditory processing function. We liken this shared mechanism to a total cognitive resource limit that varies between groups of children, which could drive correlated individual differences in auditory processing function and visual WM. Our findings provide a neurophysiological correlate for reports of WM deficits in ADHD patients and indicate potential effective markers for clinical intervention.

Commonly used casea 'control designs assume homogeneity among subjects, which limits their ability to identify biological heterogeneity, while normative modeling pinpoints deviations from typical functional network development at individual level. Methods Using a world-wide multi-site database known as Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, we analyzed individuals with ASD and typically developed (TD) controls (total n = 1218) aged 5-40 years, generating individualized whole-brain network functional connectivity (FC) maps of age-related atypicality in ASD. We then used local polynomial regression to estimate a networkwise normative model of development and explored correlations between ASD symptoms and brain networks. Results We identified a subset exhibiting highly atypical individual-level FC, exceeding 2 standard deviation from the normative value. We also identified clinically relevant networks (mainly default mode network) at cohort level, since the outlier rates decreased with age in TD participants, but increased in those with autism. Moreover, deviations were linked to severity of repetitive behaviors and social communication symptoms. Conclusions Individuals with ASD exhibit distinct, highly individualized trajectories of brain functional network development. In addition, distinct developmental trajectories were observed among ASD and TD individuals, suggesting that it may be challenging to identify true differences in network characteristics by comparing young children with ASD to their TD peers. This study enhances understanding of the biological heterogeneity of the disorder and can inform precision medicine.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

However, less is known about potentially modifiable factors that lead to decreased loneliness. Methods We used data from the Health and Retirement Study to prospectively evaluate a wide array of candidate predictors of subsequent loneliness. Importantly, we examined if changes in 69 physical-, behavioral-, and psychosocial-health factors (from t0;2006/2008 to t1;2010/2012) were associated with subsequent loneliness 4 years later (t2;2014/2016). Results Adjusting for a large range of covariates, changes in certain health behaviors (e.g. increased physical activity), physical health factors (e.g. fewer functioning limitations), psychological factors (e.g. increased purpose in life, decreased depression), and social factors (e.g. greater number of close friends) were associated with less subsequent loneliness. Conclusions Our findings suggest that subjective ratings of physical and psychological health and perceived social environment (e.g. chronic pain, self-rated health, purpose in life, anxiety, neighborhood cohesion) are more strongly associated with subsequent loneliness. Yet, objective ratings (e.g. specific chronic health conditions, living status) show less evidence of associations with subsequent loneliness. The current study identified potentially modifiable predictors of subsequent loneliness that may be important targets for interventions aimed at reducing loneliness.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

Building upon synaptic plasticity hypothesis, inflammation may contribute the underlying pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Yet, pinpointing the specific inflammatory agents responsible for schizophrenia remains a complex challenge, mainly due to medication and metabolic status. Multiple lines of evidence point to a wide-spread genetic association across genome underlying the phenotypic variations of schizophrenia. Method We collected the latest genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) summary data of schizophrenia, cytokines, and longitudinal change of brain. We utilized the omnigenic model which takes into account all genomic SNPs included in the GWAS of trait, instead of traditional Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. We conducted two round MR to investigate the inflammatory triggers of schizophrenia and the resulting longitudinal changes in the brain. Results We identified seven inflammation markers linked to schizophrenia onset, which all passed the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (bNGF, GROA(CXCL1), IL-8, M-CSF, MCP-3 (CCL7), TNF-β, CRP). Moreover, CRP were found to significantly influence the linear rate of brain morphology changes, predominantly in the white matter of the cerebrum and cerebellum. Conclusion With an omnigenic approach, our study sheds light on the immune pathology of schizophrenia. Although these findings need confirmation from future studies employing different methodologies, our work provides substantial evidence that pervasive, low-level neuroinflammation may play a pivotal role in schizophrenia, potentially leading to notable longitudinal changes in brain morphology.

Methods A two-armed randomized-controlled trial recruiting from LTC charities. Participants with anxiety and/or depression symptoms related to their LTC(s) were randomized (concealed allocation via independent administrator) to COMPASS (access to 11 tailored modules plus five thirty-minute therapist support sessions) or standard charity support (SCS). Assessments were completed online pre-randomization, at 6- and 12-weeks post-randomization. Primary outcome was Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale; PHQ-ADS measured at 12-weeks. Analysis used intention-to-treat principles with adjusted mean differences estimated using linear mixed-effects models. Data-analyst was blinded to group allocation. Results 194 participants were randomized to COMPASS (N = 94) or SCS (N = 100). At 12-weeks, mean level of psychological distress was 6.82 (95% confidence interval; CI 4.55-9.10) points lower (p < 0.001) in the COMPASS arm compared with SCS (standardized mean difference of 0.71 (95% CI 0.48-0.95)). The COMPASS arm also showed moderate significant treatment effects on secondary outcomes including depression, anxiety and illness-related distress and small significant effects on functioning and quality-of-life. Rates of adverse events were comparable across the arms. Deterioration in distress at 12-weeks was observed in 2.2% of the SCS arm, and no participants in the COMPASS arm. Conclusion Compared with SCS, COMPASS digital therapeutic with minimal therapist input reduces psychological distress at post-treatment (12-weeks). COMPASS offers a potentially scalable implementation model for health services but its translation to these contexts needs further evaluating. Copyright 2024 © The Author(s).

Methods Four primary care cohorts of UK children (pregnancy, 1 and 2 years prior to pregnancy, and siblings) born between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2017 were constructed. NDD included autism/autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy. Maternal exposures included depression/anxiety and/or infection. Maternal (age, smoking status, comorbidities, body mass index, NDD); child (gender, ethnicity, birth year); and area-level (region and level of deprivation) confounders were captured. The NDD incidence rate among (1) children exposed during or outside of pregnancy and (2) siblings discordant for exposure in pregnancy was compared using Cox-regression models, unadjusted and adjusted for confounders.

We aim to provide mechanistic insights into this association using brain network topology and to examine the potential role of parent-child reading in mitigating the effects of screen time. Methods We examined the association of screen time on brain network topology using linear regression analysis and tested if the network topology mediated the association between screen time and later socio-emotional competence. Lastly, we tested if parent-child reading time was a moderator of the link between screen time and brain network topology. Results Infant screen time was significantly associated with the emotion processing-cognitive control network integration (p = 0.005). This network integration also significantly mediated the association between screen time and both measures of socio-emotional competence (BRIEF-2 Emotion Regulation Index, p = 0.04; SEARS total score, p = 0.04). Parent-child reading time significantly moderated the association between screen time and emotion processing-cognitive control network integration (β =-0.640, p = 0.005). Conclusion Our study identified emotion processing-cognitive control network integration as a plausible biological pathway linking screen time in infancy and later socio-emotional competence.

We aimed to examine trends in in-patient suicide rates and determine if characteristics of in-patients who died by suicide have changed over time. Methods We identified all in-patients in England who died by suicide between 2009 and 2020 from the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Safety in Mental Health. Suicide rates were calculated using data from Hospital Episodes Statistics. Results The rate of in-patient suicide per 100 000 bed days fell by 41.9% between 2009-2011 and 2018-2020. However, since 2016 the rate has remained static with no significant fall. Rates fell in men, those aged 30-59, and those with schizophrenia and other delusional disorders or personality disorder. Rates also fell for suicide by hanging (including hanging on the ward) and jumping. No falls were seen in suicide rates among women, younger and older age groups, and those with affective disorder. There was no indication of a transfer of risk to the post-discharge period or to home treatment/crisis care. More in-patients in the latter part of the study were aged under 25, were on authorised leave, and had psychiatric comorbidity. Conclusions In-patient suicide has significantly fallen since 2009, suggesting patient safety may have improved. The recent slowdown in the fall in rates, however, highlights that renewed preventative efforts are needed. These should include a greater focus on women, younger and older patients, and those with affective disorder. Careful reviews prior to granting leave are important to ensure a safe transition into the community. Copyright 2024 © The Author(s). Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

However, it remains unclear whether CT may influence specific cellular or extracellular compartments of FA in SZ with CT experience. We extended our previous study on FA in SZ (Costello et al., 2023) and examined the impact of CT on hypothesized lower free water-corrected FA (FAT) and higher extracellular free water (FW). Method Thirty-seven SZ and 129 healthy controls (HC) were grouped into the 'none/low' or 'high' CT group. All participants underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. We performed tract-based spatial statistics to study the main effects of diagnostic group and CT, and the interaction between CT and diagnostic group across FAT and FW. Results SZ displayed lower FAT within the corpus callosum and corona radiata compared to HC (p < 0.05, Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE)). Independent of diagnosis, we observed lower FAT (p < 0.05, TFCE) and higher FW (p < 0.05, TFCE) in both SZ and HC with high CT levels compared to SZ and HC with none or low CT levels. Furthermore, we did not identify an interaction between CT and diagnostic group (p > 0.05, TFCE). Conclusions These novel findings suggest that the impact of CT on lower FAT may reflect cellular rather than extracellular alterations in established schizophrenia. This highlights the impact of CT on white matter microstructure, regardless of diagnostic status.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2025.","Article","Scopus"

In this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized control trial (RCT), we assessed whether intranasal oxytocin (OT) augments the therapeutic efficacy of psychotherapy for MDD and improves the therapeutic alliance. Methods Twenty-three volunteers (12 female) with MDD underwent 16 sessions of interpersonal therapy. Prior to each session, volunteers self-administered 24 International Units of intranasal OT (n = 12; Syntocinon) or placebo (n = 11). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology at pre- and post-treatment, and at a six month follow-up. Results Multilevel modeling found a significant effect of OT on the negative slope of depressive symptoms over time (p < 0.05), with medium-large effect sizes at post-treatment (Cohen's d = 0.75) and follow-up (Cohen's d = 0.82). Drug intervention also predicted the intercept when examining the weekly ratings of the therapeutic alliance (p < 0.05), such that volunteers receiving OT, relative to placebo, reported improved therapeutic alliance at session 1. The agreement of goals between therapists and participants, a facet of the therapeutic alliance, mediated the relationship between drug intervention and clinical outcome. Conclusion In this pilot study, the administration of intranasal OT, relative to placebo, improved the therapeutic alliance at the beginning of therapy and therapeutic efficacy of psychotherapy in persons with MDD.

We addressed this issue by investigating whether and how ER flexibility relate to different dynamic aspects (variability, instability, inertia, and recovery) of negative affect (NA) in a combined early psychosis sample, consisting of both individuals at high clinical risk for psychosis and those diagnosed with first-episode psychosis. Methods Participants were 148 individuals from the INTERACT project, a multi-center randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy in early psychosis. We utilized data from the baseline assessment, during which all participants completed six days of experience sampling assessment of momentary NA, as well as end-of-day assessments of ER strategy use. Results Multilevel models of within-person associations showed that greater ER flexibility was associated with more stable NA, and quicker recovery of NA from stressors during the day. Linear regression analyses of between-person associations showed that people who had more variable and unstable NA reported greater ER flexibility generally. No evidence was found for associations with NA inertia. Conclusions The current study identified unique within-person and between-person links between ER flexibility and dynamics of NA in early psychosis. These findings further provide evidence for ER flexibility in early psychosis, emphasizing the adaptive nature of regulatory flexibility in relation to reduced instability in NA and faster recovery from NA in everyday life.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

In the current study, we investigated associations between cannabis use and biomarkers of inflammation. Methods Utilizing a sample of 914 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we investigated whether interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), C-reactive protein (CRP), and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) measured at age 24 were associated with past year daily cannabis use, less frequent cannabis use, and no past year cannabis use. We adjusted for a number of covariates including sociodemographic measures, body mass index, childhood trauma, and tobacco smoking. We found evidence of a strong association between daily or near daily cannabis use and suPAR. Results We did not find any associations between less frequent cannabis use and suPAR. We did not find evidence of an association between IL-6, TNFα or CRP, and cannabis use. Conclusions Our finding that frequent cannabis use is strongly associated with suPAR, a biomarker of systemic chronic inflammation implicated in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative processes is novel. These findings may provide valuable insights into biological mechanisms by which cannabis affects the brain and impacts the risk of serious mental disorders. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

To simplify the seemingly complex relationships underlying such comorbidity, methods that include multiple measures to distill which specific addictions are uniquely associated with specific mental health disorders rather than due to the co-occurrence of other related addictions or mental health disorders can be used. Methods In a general population sample of Jewish adults in Israel (N = 4002), network analysis methods were used to create partial correlation networks of continuous measures of problematic substance (non-medical use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and prescription sedatives, stimulants, and opioid painkillers) and behavioral (gambling, electronic gaming, sexual behavior, pornography, internet, social media, and smartphone) addictions and common mental health problems (depression, anxiety, and post-Traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), adjusted for all variables in the model. Results Strongest associations were observed within these clusters: (1) PTSD, anxiety, and depression; (2) problematic substance use and gambling; (3) technology-based addictive behaviors; and (4) problematic sexual behavior and pornography. In terms of comorbidity, the strongest unique associations were observed for PTSD and problematic technology-based behaviors (social media, smartphone), and sedatives and stimulants use; depression and problematic technology-based behaviors (gaming, internet) and sedatives and cannabis use; and anxiety and problematic smartphone use. Conclusions Network analysis isolated unique relationships underlying the observed comorbidity between common mental health problems and addictions, such as associations between mental health problems and technology-based behaviors, which is informative for more focused interventions.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Methods We explored the connectome-wide neural correlates of emotion regulation tendencies using functional and diffusion magnetic resonance images of healthy young adults (N = 99; age 20-30; 28 females). We first tested the importance of considering both the functional and structural connectome through intersubject representational similarity analyses. Then, we employed a canonical correlation analysis between the functional-structural hybrid connectome and 23 emotion regulation strategies. Lastly, we sought to externally validate the results on a transdiagnostic adolescent sample (N = 93; age 11-19; 34 females). Results First, interindividual similarity of emotion regulation profiles was significantly correlated with interindividual similarity of the functional-structural hybrid connectome, more so than either the functional or structural connectome. Canonical correlation analysis revealed that an adaptive-To-maladaptive gradient of emotion regulation tendencies mapped onto a specific configuration of covariance within the functional-structural hybrid connectome, which primarily involved functional connections in the motor network and the visual networks as well as structural connections in the default mode network and the subcortical-cerebellar network. In the transdiagnostic adolescent dataset, stronger functional signatures of the found network were associated with higher general positive affect through more frequent use of adaptive coping strategies. Conclusions Taken together, our study illustrates a gradient of emotion regulation tendencies that is best captured when simultaneously considering the functional and structural connections across the whole brain.

Genetic and epidemiological interplay in AN risk were examined using data from Danish nationwide registers. AN polygenic risk score (PRS) and risk factor associations, confounding from AN PRS and/or parental psychiatric history on the association between the risk factors and AN risk, and interactions between AN PRS and each level of target risk factor on AN risk were estimated. Methods Participants were individuals born in Denmark between 1981 and 2008 including nationwide-representative data from the iPSYCH2015, and Danish AN cases from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative and Eating Disorder Genetics Initiative cohorts. A total of 7003 individuals with AN and 45 229 individuals without a registered AN diagnosis were included. We included 22 AN risk factors from Danish registers. Results Risk factors showing association with PRS for AN included urbanicity, parental ages, genitourinary tract infection, and parental socioeconomic factors. Risk factors showed the expected association to AN risk, and this association was only slightly attenuated when adjusted for parental history of psychiatric disorders or/and for the AN PRS. The interaction analyses revealed a differential effect of AN PRS according to the level of the following risk factors: sex, maternal age, genitourinary tract infection, C-section, parental socioeconomic factors and psychiatric history.

However, previous studies report conflicting results. To better understand the role of the pituitary gland in psychosis, we examined a large transdiagnostic sample of individuals with psychotic disorders. Methods The study included 751 participants (174 with schizophrenia, 114 with schizoaffective disorder, 167 with psychotic bipolar disorder, and 296 healthy controls) across six sites in the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes consortium. Structural magnetic resonance images were obtained, and pituitary gland volumes were measured using the MAGeT brain algorithm. Linear mixed models examined between-group differences with controls and among patient subgroups based on diagnosis, as well as how pituitary volumes were associated with symptom severity, cognitive function, antipsychotic dose, and illness duration. Results Mean pituitary gland volume did not significantly differ between patients and controls. No significant effect of diagnosis was observed. Larger pituitary gland volume was associated with greater symptom severity (F = 13.61, p = 0.0002), lower cognitive function (F = 4.76, p = 0.03), and higher antipsychotic dose (F = 5.20, p = 0.02). Illness duration was not significantly associated with pituitary gland volume. When all variables were considered, only symptom severity significantly predicted pituitary gland volume (F = 7.54, p = 0.006). Conclusions Although pituitary volumes were not increased in psychotic disorders, larger size may be a marker associated with more severe symptoms in the progression of psychosis. This finding helps clarify previous inconsistent reports and highlights the need for further research into pituitary gland-related factors in individuals with psychosis.

Machine learning methods provide opportunities to identify combinations of factors that contribute to risk prediction models. Methods A machine learning approach was applied to predict anxiety disorder remission in a large sample of 2114 anxious youth (5-18 years). Potential predictors included demographic, clinical, parental, and treatment variables with data obtained pre-Treatment, post-Treatment, and at least one follow-up. Results All machine learning models performed similarly for remission outcomes, with AUC between 0.67 and 0.69. There was significant alignment between the factors that contributed to the models predicting two target outcomes: remission of all anxiety disorders and the primary anxiety disorder. Children who were older, had multiple anxiety disorders, comorbid depression, comorbid externalising disorders, received group treatment and therapy delivered by a more experienced therapist, and who had a parent with higher anxiety and depression symptoms, were more likely than other children to still meet criteria for anxiety disorders at the completion of therapy. In both models, the absence of a social anxiety disorder and being treated by a therapist with less experience contributed to the model predicting a higher likelihood of remission. Conclusions These findings underscore the utility of prediction models that may indicate which children are more likely to remit or are more at risk of non-remission following CBT for childhood anxiety.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Methods Using population-based registers, quarterly cohorts from the first quarter of 2018 (2018Q1) to 2021Q4 were formed including all Swedish-residents >10 years old. Interrupted time series and generalized estimating equations analyses were used to evaluate changes in Incidence Rates (IR) of specialised healthcare use for suicide attempt and death by suicide per 10 000 person-years for individuals with or without specific severe mental disorders (SMDs) during, compared to before the pandemic. Results The IR (95% Confidence interval, CI) of suicide in individuals with SMDs decreased from 16.0 (15.0-17.1) in 2018Q1 to 11.6 (10.8-12.5) in 2020Q1 (i.e. the quarter before the start of the pandemic), after which it dropped further to 6.7 (6.3-7.2) in 2021Q2. In contrast, IRs of suicide attempt in SMDs showed more stable trends, as did the trends regarding suicide and suicide attempt for individuals without SMD. These discrepancies were most evident for individuals with substance use disorder and ASD/ADHD. Changes in IRs of suicide v. suicide attempt for one quarter during the pandemic for substance misuse were 11.2% v. 3.6% respectively. These changes for ASD/ADHD were 10.7% v. 3.6%. Conclusions The study shows pronounced decreases in suicide rates in individuals with SMDs during the pandemic. Further studies aiming to understand mechanisms behind these trends are warranted to consult future suicide prevention strategies. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

We examined the role of psychosocial/environmental factors in moderating polygenic risk for opioid use disorder (OUD). Methods Data from 1958 European ancestry adults who participated in the Yale-Penn 3 study were analyzed. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were based on a large-scale multi-trait analysis of genome-wide association studies (MTAG) of OUD. Results A total of 420 (21.1%) individuals had a lifetime diagnosis of OD. OUD PRS were positively associated with OD (odds ratio [OR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-1.66). Household income and education were the strongest correlates of OD. Among individuals with higher OUD PRS, those with higher education level had lower odds of OD (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85-0.98); and those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were more likely to have OD relative to those without PTSD (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.04-2.35). Conclusions Results suggest an interplay between genetics and psychosocial environment in contributing to OD risk. While PRS alone do not yet have useful clinical predictive utility, psychosocial factors may help enhance prediction. These findings could inform more targeted clinical and policy interventions to help address this public health crisis.  © The Author(s), 2024.

This study is to explore whether ART is associated with increased depression and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and parenting stress, and poorer antenatal attachment, over the perinatal period from pregnancy to 12 months postpartum. Methods This study drew on data collected within an ongoing cohort from 806 women including 42 who had conceived using ART, and all recruited in early pregnancy and followed to 12 months postpartum. Measures included the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale and Parenting Stress Index. Results Women who conceived with ART were no more likely to be depressed. They had lower depressive and anxiety symptoms in early pregnancy, higher antenatal attachment and lower parenting stress. However, women who conceived with ART had a significant increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms in late pregnancy which reduced in the postpartum and showed a distinct pattern compared to those who conceived naturally. Conclusions This study found that women who conceived with ART did not have poorer emotional wellbeing across the perinatal period. However, in late pregnancy depressive and anxiety symptoms did rise and consideration of this clinically and in future research is warranted.  © The Author(s), 2025.","Article","Scopus"

It is unclear what clinical and cognitive phenotypic characteristics present during remission predict future recurrence. Methods: Participants (135 with remitted LLD and 69 comparison subjects across three institutions) completed baseline phenotyping, including psychiatric, medical, and social history, psychiatric symptom and personality trait assessment, and neuropsychological testing. Participants were clinically assessed every two months for two years while receiving standard antidepressant treatment. Analyses examined group differences in phenotypic measure using general linear models. Concurrent associations between phenotypic measures and diagnostic groups were examined using LASSO logistic regression. Results: Sixty (44%) LLD participants experienced a relapse over the two-year period. Numerous phenotypic measures across all domains differed between remitted LLD and comparison participants. Only residual depressive symptom severity, rumination, medical comorbidity, and executive dysfunction significantly predicted LLD classification. Fewer measures differed between relapsing and sustained remission LLD subgroups, with the relapsing group exhibiting greater antidepressant treatment intensity, greater fatigue, rumination, and disability, higher systolic blood pressure, greater life stress and lower instrumental social support. Relapsing group classification was informed by antidepressant treatment intensity, lower instrumental social support, and greater life stress. Conclusions: A wide range of phenotypic factors differed between remitted LLD and comparison groups. Fewer measures differed between relapsing and sustained remission LLD subgroups, with less social support and greater stress informing vulnerability to subsequent relapse. This research suggests potential targets for relapse prevention and emphasizes the need for clinically translatable relapse biomarkers to inform care.

We mapped 'networks of care' to explore patterns of mental health help-seeking alongside the perceived helpfulness of support accessed. Methods We examined data from 23 927 adolescents aged 11-18 years who participated in the 2023 OxWell Student Survey, an English school-based, repeated cross-sectional survey of mental health and wellbeing. Students self-reported past-year access to 18 types of support across informal (e.g. friends and family), semi-formal (e.g. school and charities), and formal (e.g. health and social care) domains, alongside how helpful they found the support. We used a network approach to explore interconnections between sources of support accessed and perceived helpfulness. Results One in four (27.0%, 6449/23927) adolescents reported past-year access to mental health support, of which 56.7% (3658/6449) reported accessing multiple types. Informal networks were the most commonly accessed (23.1%, 5523/23927), followed by semi-formal (9.7%, 2317/23927) and formal (6.8%, 1623/23927) supports. Informal sources had high acceptability, with around 80-90% reporting them as helpful, whereas child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), helplines, and online supports were perceived to be the least helpful. The networks also identified groups who might not be optimally served by current systems, including gender diverse adolescents and adolescents who found mental health support from their parents unhelpful. Conclusions Adolescents are accessing mental health support across informal, semi-formal, and formal sources of care. Services can no longer be developed, delivered, or evaluated in isolation from these networks.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Precise and scalable approaches have yet to be established. Two studies investigating the amygdala-related electrical fingerprint (Amyg-EFP) in BPD are presented: one study addressing the deep-brain correlates of Amyg-EFP, and a second study investigating neurofeedback (NF) as a means to improve brain self-regulation. Methods Study 1 combined electroencephalography (EEG) and simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the replicability of Amyg-EFP-related brain activation found in the reference dataset (N = 24 healthy subjects, 8 female; re-analysis of published data) in the replication dataset (N = 16 female individuals with BPD). In the replication dataset, we additionally explored how the Amyg-EFP would map to neural circuits defined by the research domain criteria. Study 2 investigated a 10-session Amyg-EFP NF training in parallel to a 12-weeks residential dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) program. Fifteen patients with BPD completed the training, N = 15 matched patients served as DBT-only controls. Results Study 1 replicated previous findings and showed significant amygdala blood oxygenation level dependent activation in a whole-brain regression analysis with the Amyg-EFP. Neurocircuitry activation (negative affect, salience, and cognitive control) was correlated with the Amyg-EFP signal. Study 2 showed Amyg-EFP modulation with NF training, but patients received reversed feedback for technical reasons, which limited interpretation of results. Conclusions Recorded via scalp EEG, the Amyg-EFP picks up brain activation of high relevance for emotion. Administering Amyg-EFP NF in addition to standardized BPD treatment was shown to be feasible. Clinical utility remains to be investigated.  © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

To maximize the sensitivity of regional effects, we computed relative metabolic measures by normalizing the regional measures to white matter metabolism. Additionally, we explored the role of rest-Activity rhythms/sleep-wake activity measured with actigraphy in the seasonal variations of regional brain metabolic activity. Results We found that seasonal variations of cerebral glucose metabolism differed across brain regions. Glucose metabolism in prefrontal regions increased with longer daylength and with greater day-To-day increases in daylength. The cuneus and olfactory bulb had the maximum and minimum metabolic values around the summer and winter solstice respectively (positively associated with daylength), whereas the temporal lobe, brainstem, and postcentral cortex showed maximum and minimum metabolic values around the spring and autumn equinoxes, respectively (positively associated with faster daylength gain). Longer daylength was associated with greater amplitude and robustness of diurnal activity rhythms suggesting circadian involvement. Conclusions The current findings advance our knowledge of seasonal patterns in a key indicator of brain function relevant for mood and cognition. These data could inform treatment interventions for psychiatric symptoms that peak at specific times of the year. Copyright © National Institutes of Health, 2024.","Article","Scopus"

However, the specific role of Hb in OCD remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the structural and functional abnormalities of Hb in OCD and their relationship with the clinical symptoms. Methods Eighty patients with OCD and 85 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited as the primary dataset. The grey matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity (FC), and effective connectivity (EC) of the Hb were calculated and compared between OCD group and HCs. An independent replication dataset was used to verify the stability and robustness of the results. Results Patients with OCD exhibited smaller Hb volume and increased FC of right Hb-left hippocampus than HCs. Dynamic causal model revealed an increased EC from left hippocampus to right Hb and a less inhibitory causal influence from the right Hb to left hippocampus in the OCD group compared to HCs. Similar results were found in the replication dataset. Conclusions This study suggested that abnormal structure of Hb and hippocampus-Hb connectivity may contribute to the pathological basis of OCD.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Research on this topic is still largely missing on refugees and asylum seekers. The current study aimed to characterize predictors for dropout in the Mental Health in Refugees and Asylum Seekers (MEHIRA) study, one of the largest multicentered controlled trials investigating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a nationwide stepped and collaborative care model. Methods Predictors were multiply imputed and selected for descriptive modelling using backward elimination. The final variable set was entered into logistic regression. Results The overall dropout rate was 41,7%. Dropout was higher in participants in group therapy (p = 0.001; OR = 10.7), with larger satisfaction with social relationships (p = 0.017; OR = 1.87), with difficulties in maintaining personal relationships (p = 0.005; OR = 4.27), and with higher depressive symptoms (p = 0.029; OR = 1.05). Participants living in refugee accommodation (p = 0.040; OR = 0.45), with a change in social status (p = 0.008; OR = 0.67) and with conduct (p = 0.020; OR = 0.24) and emotional problems (p = 0.013; OR = 0.31) were significantly less likely to drop out of treatment. Conclusion Overall, the outcomes of this study suggest that predictors assessing social relationships, social status, and living conditions should be considered as topics of psychological treatment to increase adherence and as predictors for future research studies (including treatment type).

However, not all individuals who experience early adversity develop these inflammatory outcomes. Separately, there is also a link between various internalizing emotional distress conditions (e.g. depression, anxiety, and fear) and inflammation in adulthood. It is possible the combination of adult emotional distress and past childhood adversity may be uniquely important for explaining psychopathology-related immune dysfunction at midlife. Methods Using data from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study (n = 1255), we examined whether internalizing, defined as past 12-month emotional distress symptomatology and trait neuroticism, moderated associations between childhood adversity and heightened inflammation in adulthood. Using latent variable modeling, we examined whether transdiagnostic or disorder-specific features of emotional distress better predicted inflammation. Results We observed that childhood adversity only predicted adult inflammation when participants also reported adult internalizing emotional distress. Furthermore, this moderation effect was specific to the transdiagnostic factor of emotional distress rather than the disorder-specific features. Conclusions We discuss the possibility that adult internalizing symptoms and trait neuroticism together may signal the presence of temporally stable vulnerabilities that amplify the impact of childhood adversity on midlife immune alterations. The study highlights the importance of identifying emotional distress in individuals who have experienced childhood adversity to address long-term immune outcomes and enhance overall health.

Methods A retrospective e-cohort study of whole population routine electronic healthcare records was conducted. Poisson regression was undertaken to explore trends over time for depression, antidepressant prescribing, indications and secondary care contacts. Time trend analysis was conducted to assess the impact of guidance. Results A total of 643 322 primary care patients in Wales UK, aged 6-17 years from 2010-2019 contributed 3 215 584 person-years of follow-up. Adjusted incidence of depression more than doubled (IRR for 2019 = 2.8 [2.5-3.2]) with similar trends seen for antidepressants. Fluoxetine was the most frequently prescribed first-line antidepressant. Citalopram comprised less than 5% of first prescriptions in younger children but 22.9% (95% CI 22.0-23.8; 95% CI 2533) in 16-17-year-olds. Approximately half of new antidepressant prescribing was associated with depression. Segmented regression analysis showed that prescriptions of 'all' antidepressants, Fluoxetine and Sertraline were increasing before the guidance. This upward trend flattened for both 'all' antidepressants and Fluoxetine and steepened for Sertraline. Citalopram prescribing was decreasing significantly pre guidance being issued with no significant change afterward. Conclusions Targeted intervention is needed to address rising rates of depression in children. Practitioners are partially adhering to local and national guidance. The decision-making process behind prescribing choices is likely to be multi-factorial. Activities to support implementation of guidance should be adopted in relation to safety in prescribing of antidepressants in children including timely availability of talking therapies and specialist mental health services.  © The Author(s), 2025.","Article","Scopus"

Longitudinal associations between peer victimization and two-year changes in mental health symptoms of major depression disorder (MDD), separation anxiety (SA), prodromal psychosis (PP), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were examined including a wide range of covariates. Mixed linear models were used to test for the moderating effects of parental warmth and prosocial school environment. Results 20% of children experienced peer victimization. Higher exposure to peer victimization was associated with increases in MDD, SA, and ADHD symptoms. Parental warmth was associated with decreases in MDD symptoms but did not robustly buffer the link between peer victimization and mental health symptoms.

However, due to a lack of objective measures, the role of intrinsic v. extrinsic control of motivation in psychiatric disorders remains poorly understood. Methods We developed a novel multi-factorial behavioral task that separates the distinct contributions of intrinsic v. extrinsic control, and determines their influence on motivation and outcome sensitivity in a range of contextual environments. We deployed this task in two independent cohorts (final in-person N = 181 and final online N = 258), including individuals with and without depression and anxiety disorders. Results There was a significant interaction between group (controls, depression, anxiety) and control-condition (extrinsic, intrinsic) on motivation where participants with depression showed lower extrinsic motivation and participants with anxiety showed higher extrinsic motivation compared to controls, while intrinsic motivation was broadly similar across the groups. There was also a significant group-by-valence (rewards, losses) interaction, where participants with major depressive disorder showed lower motivation to avoid losses, but participants with anxiety showed higher motivation to avoid losses. Finally, there was a double-dissociation with anhedonic symptoms whereby anticipatory anhedonia was associated with reduced extrinsic motivation, whereas consummatory anhedonia was associated with lower sensitivity to outcomes that modulated intrinsic behavior. These findings were robustly replicated in the second independent cohort. Conclusions Together this work demonstrates the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic control on altering motivation and outcome sensitivity, and shows how depression, anhedonia, and anxiety may influence these biases.

Methods Individuals aged 19-60 years living in Sweden with a first-time BD diagnosis between 2007 and 2016 (n = 25 231) were followed from the date of diagnosis for a maximum of 14 years. Risk of disability pension (DP), long-term sickness absence (SA) (>90 days), and long-term unemployment (>180 days) was compared to a matched comparison group from the general population, matched 1:5 on sex and birth year (n = 126 155), and unaffected full siblings (n = 24 098), using sex-stratified Cox regression analysis, yielding hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results After adjusting for socioeconomic factors, baseline labor market status, and comorbid disorders, individuals with BD had a significantly higher risk of DP compared to the general population (HR = 16.67, 95% CI 15.33-18.13) and their unaffected siblings (HR = 5.54, 95% CI 4.96-6.18). Individuals with BD were also more likely to experience long-term SA compared to the general population (HR = 3.19, 95% CI 3.09-3.30) and their unaffected siblings (HR = 2.83, 95% CI 2.70-2.97). Moreover, individuals diagnosed with BD had an elevated risk of long-term unemployment relative to both comparison groups (HR range: 1.75-1.78). Men with BD had a higher relative risk of SA and unemployment than women. No difference was found in DP.

Consistent with this, several studies found reduced PS in adults as well as adolescents with NSSI. Cross-sectional studies in adults with borderline personality disorder (BPD) suggest that PS may (partially) normalize after remission or reduction of BPD symptoms. The objective of the present study was to investigate the development of PS over 1 year in a sample of adolescents with NSSI and to investigate whether PS at baseline predicts longitudinal change in NSSI. Methods N = 66 adolescents who underwent specialized treatment for NSSI disorder participated in baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments, including heat pain stimulation for the measurement of pain threshold and tolerance. Associations between PS and NSSI as well as BPD and depressive symptoms were examined using negative binomial, logistic, and linear regression analyses. Results We found that a decrease in pain threshold over time was associated with reduced NSSI (incident rate ratio = 2.04, p = 0.047) and that higher pain tolerance at baseline predicted lower probability for NSSI (odds ratio = 0.42, p = 0.016) 1 year later. However, the latter effect did not survive Holm correction (p = 0.059). No associations between PS and BPD or depressive symptoms were observed. Conclusion Our findings suggest that pain threshold might normalize with a decrease in NSSI frequency and could thus serve as a state marker for NSSI.

These sleep disturbances appear to represent a key aspect in the etiology and maintenance of psychotic disorders. We aimed to examine the relationship between self-reported sleep dysfunction and attenuated psychotic symptoms (APS) on a day-To-day basis. Methods Seventy-six CHR young people completed the Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) component of the European Union Gene-Environment Interaction Study, collected through PsyMate® devices, prompting sleep and symptom questionnaires 10 times daily for 6 days. Bayesian multilevel mixed linear regression analyses were performed on time-variant ESM data using the brms package in R. We investigated the day-To-day associations between sleep and psychotic experiences bidirectionally on an item level. Sleep items included sleep onset latency, fragmentation, and quality. Psychosis items assessed a range of perceptual, cognitive, and bizarre thought content common in the CHR population. Results Two of the seven psychosis variables were unidirectionally predicted by previous night's number of awakenings: every unit increase in number of nightly awakenings predicted a 0.27 and 0.28 unit increase in feeling unreal or paranoid the next day, respectively. No other sleep variables credibly predicted next-day psychotic symptoms or vice-versa. Conclusion In this study, the relationship between sleep disturbance and APS appears specific to the item in question. However, some APS, including perceptual disturbances, had low levels of endorsement amongst this sample. Nonetheless, these results provide evidence for a unidirectional relationship between sleep and some APS in this population.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Literature so far suggests a self-perpetuating cycle wherein momentary increases in PEs lead to social withdrawal, which, subsequently, triggers PEs at a next point in time, especially when SI is associated with increased distress. The current study investigated the daily-life temporal associations between SI and PEs, as well as the role of SI-related and general affective distress in individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. Methods We used experience sampling methodology in a sample of 137 CHR participants. We analyzed the association between SI, PEs, and distress using time-lagged linear mixed-effects models. Results SI did not predict next-moment fluctuations in PEs, or vice versa. Furthermore, although SI-related distress was not predictive of subsequent PEs, general affective distress during SI was a robust predictor of next-moment PEs. Conclusions Our results suggest that SI and PEs are not directly related on a moment-to-moment level, but a negative emotional state when alone does contribute to the risk of PEs. These findings highlight the role of affective wellbeing during early-stage psychosis development. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

No studies have examined the effect of treatment on within-day timing of loss of control eating severity. We examined whether time of day differentially predicted loss of control eating severity at baseline (i.e. pretreatment), end-of-treatment, and 6-month follow-up for individuals with binge-eating disorder (BED), hypothesizing that loss of control eating severity would increase throughout the day pretreatment and that this pattern would be less pronounced following treatment. We explored differential treatment effects of cognitive-behavioral guided self-help (CBTgsh) and Integrative Cognitive-Affective Therapy (ICAT). Methods Individuals with BED (N = 112) were randomized to receive CBTgsh or ICAT and completed a 1-week ecological momentary assessment protocol at baseline, end-of-treatment, and 6-month follow-up to assess loss of control eating severity. We used multilevel models to assess within-day slope trajectories of loss of control eating severity across assessment periods and treatment type. Results Within-day increases in loss of control eating severity were reduced at end-of-treatment and 6-month follow-up relative to baseline. Evening acceleration of loss of control eating severity was greater at 6-month follow-up relative to end-of-treatment. Within-day increases in loss of control severity did not differ between treatments at end-of-treatment; however, evening loss of control severity intensified for individuals who received CBTgsh relative to those who received ICAT at 6-month follow-up. Conclusions Findings suggest that treatment reduces evening-shifted loss of control eating severity, and that this effect may be more durable following ICAT relative to CBTgsh.

Early life risk factors of multimorbidity include adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), particularly associated with psychological conditions and weight problems. Few studies have considered related mechanisms and focus on old age participants. We are interested in estimating, from young adulthood, the risk of overweight-depression comorbidity related to ACEs while adjusting for early life confounders and intermediate variables. Methods We used data from the 1958 National Child Development Study, a prospective birth cohort study (N = 18 558). A four-category outcome (no condition, overweight only, depression only and, overweight-depression comorbidity) was constructed at 23, 33, and 42 years. Multinomial logistic regression models adjusting for intermediate variables co-occurring with this outcome were created. ACEs and sex interaction on comorbidity risk was tested. Results In our study sample (N = 7762), we found that ACEs were associated with overweight-depression comorbidity risk throughout adulthood (RRR [95% CI] at 23y = 3.80 [2.10-6.88]) though less overtime. Comorbidity risk was larger than risk of separate conditions. Intermediate variables explained part of the association. After full-adjustment, an association remained (RRR [95% CI] at 23y = 2.00 [1.08-3.72]). Comorbidity risk related to ACEs differed by sex at 42. Conclusion Our study provides evidence on the link and potential mechanisms between ACEs and the co-occurrence of mental and physical diseases throughout the life-course. We suggest addressing ACEs in intervention strategies and public policies to go beyond single disease prevention.  © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

To clarify this relationship, a combined epidemiological and genetic approach was chosen to exploit the methodological advantages of both approaches. Methods Data from 2026 males from a nationwide, representative study were used to investigate the non-/linear relationship between pubertal timing defined by the age at voice break and depression, considering a multitude of potential confounders and their interactions with pubertal timing. This analysis was complemented by Mendelian randomization (MR), which is robust to inferential problems inherent to epidemiological studies. We used 71 single nucleotide polymorphisms related to pubertal timing in males as instrumental variable to clarify its causal relationship with depression based on data from 807 553 individuals (246 363 cases and 561 190 controls) by univariable and multivariable MR, including BMI as pleiotropic phenotype. Results Univariable MR indicated a causal effect of pubertal timing on depression risk (inverse-variance weighted: OR 0.93, 95%-CI [0.87-0.99)], p = 0.03). However, this was not confirmed by multivariable MR (inverse-variance weighted: OR 0.95, 95%-CI [0.88-1.02)], p = 0.13), consistent with the epidemiological approach (OR 1.01, 95%-CI [0.81-1.26], p = 0.93). Instead, the multivariable MR study indicated a causal relationship of BMI with depression by two of three methods.

People with bipolar disorder also have social isolation, though typically less than that seen in schizophrenia. We aimed to disentangle whether the social cognitive and social motivation impairments observed in schizophrenia are a specific feature of the clinical condition v. social isolation generally. Methods We compared four groups (clinically stable patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, individuals drawn from the community with self-described social isolation, and a socially connected community control group) on loneliness, social cognition, and approach and avoidance social motivation. Results Individuals with schizophrenia (n = 72) showed intermediate levels of social isolation, loneliness, and social approach motivation between the isolated (n = 96) and connected control (n = 55) groups. However, they showed significant deficits in social cognition compared to both community groups. Individuals with bipolar disorder (n = 48) were intermediate between isolated and control groups for loneliness and social approach. They did not show deficits on social cognition tasks. Both clinical groups had higher social avoidance than both community groups Conclusions The results suggest that social cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, and high social avoidance motivation in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are distinct features of the clinical conditions and not byproducts of social isolation. In contrast, differences between clinical and control groups on levels of loneliness and social approach motivation were congruent with the groups' degree of social isolation.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

However, no studies have investigated this interaction on neurobiological phenotypes. Among those, anomalous emotion-related brain activity has been reported in SCZ, even if evidence of its link with SCZ-related genetic risk is not solid. Indeed, it is possible this relationship is influenced by non-genetic risk factors. Thus, this study investigated the interaction between SCZ-related polygenic risk and ELCs on emotion-related brain activity. Methods 169 healthy participants (HP) in a discovery and 113 HP in a replication sample underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during emotion processing, were categorized for history of ELCs and genome-wide genotyped. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were computed using SCZ-associated variants considering the most recent genome-wide association study. Furthermore, 75 patients with SCZ also underwent fMRI during emotion processing to verify consistency of their brain activity patterns with those associated with risk factors for SCZ in HP. Results Results in the discovery and replication samples indicated no effect of PRSs, but an interaction between PRS and ELCs in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), where the greater the activity, the greater PRS only in presence of ELCs. Moreover, SCZ had greater VLPFC response than HP. Conclusions These results suggest that emotion-related VLPFC response lies in the path from genetic and non-genetic risk factors to the clinical presentation of SCZ, and may implicate an updated concept of intermediate phenotype considering early non-genetic factors of risk for SCZ.  © The Author(s), 2024.

Methods We estimated two bifactor models of general and specific dimensions of psychotic experiences in unaffected siblings of patients (n = 52) and community controls (n = 200), and of psychotic symptoms in first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients (n = 110). We evaluated associations between these transdiagnostic dimensions and trait (TNF-α, IFN-γ), state (IL-6, IL-1β), and regulatory (TGF-β, IL-10, IL-4) cytokines. We explored whether schizophrenia genetic liability (schizophrenia polygenic risk score; SZ-PRS) modified the associations. Results High levels of trait marker IFN-γ were associated with the severity of general psychosis dimension in the unaffected siblings and community controls, expanding to the depressive dimension in siblings and to the manic dimension in FEP. High TNF-α levels were associated with more positive psychotic experiences in unaffected siblings and manic symptoms in FEP. Low levels of state markers IL-6 and IL-1β were observed in unaffected siblings presenting more depressive experiences. Still, high levels of IL-6 and IL-1β were associated with the severity of the depressive and negative symptom dimensions at FEP. The severity of transdiagnostic dimension scores across the three groups was associated with lower regulatory cytokines. Exploratory analysis suggested that a high SZ-PRS contributed mostly to associations with psychotic dimensions. Conclusions IFN-γ mapped onto the multidimensional expression of psychosis, reinforcing the trait concept. State markers IL-6 and IL-1β may fluctuate along the spectrum.

It remains unclear if cognitive deficits progress over time or remain stable. Determining patients at increased risk of progressive worsening might help targeted neurocognitive remediation approaches. Methods This 20-year follow-up study examined neurocognitive outcomes of 156 participants from the OPUS I trial. Neurocognition was assessed using the brief assessment of cognition in schizophrenia at the 10-and 20-year follow-up, allowing us to examine changes in neurocognition over ten years. Results We found that 30.5% of patients had a declining course of neurocognition, 49.2% had a stable course of neurocognition and 20.3% experienced improvements in neurocognition. Good cognitive functioning at the 20-year follow-up was significantly associated with higher levels of social functioning (B 6.86, CI 4.71-9.02, p < 0.001) while increasing experiential negative symptoms were significantly correlated to cognitive worsening (PC-0.231, p = 0.029). Younger age at inclusion (B: 0.23 per 10-years, CI 0.00-0.045, p = 0.047) and low level of education (below ten years) (mean difference:-0.346, CI-0.616 to-0.076, p = 0.012) predicted declining neurocognition. Conclusion Our findings support the notion of different schizophrenia subtypes with varying trajectories. Neurocognitive impairment at the 20-year follow-up was associated with other poor outcomes, highlighting the importance of treatments aimed at improving neurocognition in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

One theory suggests that memory retrieval is inhibited via prefrontal control. Findings from cognitive neuroscience offer a candidate mechanism for this proposed retrieval inhibition. By applying predictions based on these experimental findings, we examined the putative role of retrieval suppression in dissociative amnesia. Methods We analyzed fMRI data from two previously reported cases of dissociative amnesia. Patients had been shown reminders from forgotten and remembered time periods (colleagues and school friends). We examined the neuroanatomical overlap between regions engaged in the unrecognized compared to the recognized condition, and the regions engaged during retrieval suppression in laboratory-based tasks. Effective connectivity analyses were performed to test the hypothesized modulatory relationship between the right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (raDLPFC) and the hippocampus. Both patients were scanned again following treatment, and analyses were repeated. Results We observed substantial functional alignment between the inhibitory regions engaged during laboratory-based retrieval suppression tasks, and those engaged when patients failed to recognize their current colleagues. This included significant activation in the raDLPFC and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and a corresponding deactivation across autobiographical memory regions (hippocampus, medial PFC). Dynamic causal modeling confirmed the hypothesized modulatory relationship between the raDLPFC and the hippocampus. This pattern was no longer evident following memory recovery in the first patient, but persisted in the second patient who remained amnesic. Conclusions Findings are consistent with an inhibitory mechanism driving down activity across core memory regions to prevent the recognition of personally relevant stimuli. © The Author(s), 2025.","Article","Scopus"

Reward-related brain activity increases across adolescence and has been identified as a potential neurobiological mechanism of risk for different forms of psychopathology. The reward positivity (RewP) is an event-related potential component that indexes reward system activation and has been associated with both concurrent and family history of psychopathology. However, it is unclear whether the RewP is also associated with higher-order psychopathology subfactors and whether this relationship is present across different types of reward. Methods In a sample of 193 adolescent females and a biological parent, the present study examined the association between adolescent and parental psychopathology subfactors and adolescent RewP to monetary and social reward. Results Results indicated that the adolescent and parental distress subfactors were negatively associated with the adolescent domain-general RewP. The adolescent and parental positive mood subfactors were negatively associated with the adolescent domain-general and domain-specific monetary RewP, respectively. Conversely, the adolescent and parental fear/obsessions subfactors were positively associated with the adolescent domain-general RewP. The associations between parental and adolescent psychopathology subfactors and the adolescent RewP were independent of each other. Conclusions The RewP in adolescent females is associated with both concurrent and parental psychopathology symptoms, suggesting that it indexes both severity and risk for higher-order subfactors.

Consequently, we investigated in patients with SSD and healthy controls (HC) the relations between (1) plasma concentrations of two prototypical endocannabinoids (N-Arachidonoylethanolamine [anandamide] and 2-Arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) and (2) striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (DSC), and glutamate and y-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). As anandamide and 2-AG might reduce the activity of these neurotransmitters, we hypothesized negative correlations between their plasma levels and the abovementioned neurotransmitters in both groups. Methods Blood samples were obtained from 18 patients and 16 HC to measure anandamide and 2-AG plasma concentrations. For all subjects, we acquired proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy scans to assess Glx (i.e. glutamate plus glutamine) and GABA + (i.e. GABA plus macromolecules) concentrations in the ACC. Ten patients and 14 HC also underwent [18F]F-DOPA positron emission tomography for assessment of striatal DSC. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the relations between the outcome measures. Results A negative association between 2-AG plasma concentration and ACC Glx concentration was found in patients (p = 0.008). We found no evidence of other significant relationships between 2-AG or anandamide plasma concentrations and dopaminergic, glutamatergic, or GABAergic measures in either group. Conclusions Our preliminary results suggest an association between peripheral 2-AG and ACC Glx levels in patients.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

However, longitudinal studies are currently scarce, making it difficult to determine how alterations in hippocampal volume evolve over time. The current study examined the relationship between childhood maltreatment and hippocampal volumetric development across childhood and adolescence in a community sample. Methods In this longitudinal study, a community sample of 795 participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in three waves spanning ages 6-21 years. Childhood maltreatment was assessed using parent-report and children's self-report at baseline (6-12 years old). Mixed models were used to examine the relationship between childhood maltreatment and hippocampal volume across time. Results The quadratic term of age was significantly associated with both right and left hippocampal volume development. High exposure to childhood maltreatment was associated with reduced offset of right hippocampal volume and persistent reduced volume throughout adolescence. Critically, the relationship between childhood maltreatment and reduced right hippocampal volume remained significant after adjusting for the presence of any depressive disorder during late childhood and adolescence and hippocampal volume polygenic risk scores. Time-by-CM and Sex-by-CM interactions were not statistically significant. Conclusions The present study showed that childhood maltreatment is associated with persistent reduction of hippocampal volume in children and adolescents, even after adjusting for the presence of major depressive disorder and genetic determinants of hippocampal structure.

This study aims to refine risk prediction by developing MCD models optimized for specific early psychosis stages and target populations. Methods A comprehensive neuropsychological battery assessed 1059 individuals with FEP, 794 CHR, and 774 matched healthy controls (HCs). CHR subjects, followed up for 2 years, were categorized into converters (CHR-C) and non-converters (CHR-NC). The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery standardized neurocognitive tests were employed. Results Both the CHR and FEP groups exhibited significantly poorer performance compared to the HC group across all neurocognitive tests (all p < 0.001). The CHR-C group demonstrated poorer performance compared to the CHR-NC group on three sub-tests: visuospatial memory (p < 0.001), mazes (p = 0.005), and symbol coding (p = 0.023) tests. Upon adjusting for sex and age, the performance of the MCD model was excellent in differentiating FEP from HC, as evidenced by an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.895 (p < 0.001). However, when applied in the CHR group for predicting CHR-C (AUC = 0.581, p = 0.008), the performance was not satisfactory. To optimize the efficiency of psychotic risk assessment, three distinct MCD models were developed to distinguish FEP from HC, predict CHR-C from CHR-NC, and identify CHR from HC, achieving accuracies of 89.3%, 65.6%, and 80.2%, respectively. Conclusions The MCD exhibits variations in domains, patterns, and weights across different stages of early psychosis and diverse target populations. Emphasizing precise risk assessment, our findings highlight the importance of tailored MCD models for different stages and risk levels.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

Intervention approaches that target executive dysfunction alongside standard PTSD treatments could boost clinical response. The current study reports secondary analyses from a randomized controlled trial testing combined PTSD treatment with a computerized training program to improve executive dysfunction. We assessed if pre-treatment neurocognitive substrates of executive functioning predicted clinical response to this novel intervention. Methods Treatment-seeking veterans with PTSD (N = 60) completed a working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging prior to being randomized to six weeks of computerized executive function training (five 30-minute sessions each week) plus twelve 50-minute sessions of cognitive processing therapy (CEFT + CPT) or placebo training plus CPT (PT + CPT). Using linear mixed effects models, we examined the extent to which the neurocognitive substrates of executive functioning predicted PTSD treatment response. Results Results indicated that veterans with greater activation of working memory regions (e.g. lateral prefrontal and cingulate cortex) had better PTSD symptom improvement trajectories in CEFT + CPT v. PT + CPT. Those with less neural activation during working memory showed similar trajectories of PTSD symptom change regardless of treatment condition. Conclusions Greater activity of frontal regions implicated in working memory may serve as a biomarker of response to a novel treatment in veterans with PTSD. Individuals with greater regional responsiveness benefited more from treatment that targeted cognitive dysfunction than treatment that did not include active cognitive training.

Psychiatric disorders may be a risk factor for long COVID, broadly defined as COVID-19 conditions continuing three months post-acute infection. In US Veterans with high psychiatric burden, we examined associations between psychiatric disorders and clinical diagnosis of long COVID. Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using health records from VA patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test from February 2020 to February 2023. Generalized linear models estimated associations between any psychiatric disorder and likelihood of subsequent diagnosis with long COVID (i.e. two or more long COVID clinical codes). Models were adjusted for socio-demographic, medical, and behavioral factors. Secondary models examined individual psychiatric disorders and age-stratified associations. Results. Among 660 217 VA patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests, 56.3% had at least one psychiatric disorder diagnosis and 1.4% were diagnosed with long COVID. Individuals with any psychiatric disorder had higher risk for long COVID diagnosis in models adjusted for socio-demographic factors, vaccination status, smoking, and medical comorbidities (relative risk, RR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.21–1.35), with the strongest associations in younger individuals. Considering specific disorders, depressive, anxiety, and stress-related disorders were associated with increased risk for long COVID diagnoses (RRs = 1.36–1.48), but associations were in the opposite direction for substance use and psychotic disorders (RRs = 0.78–0.88). Conclusions. Psychiatric disorder diagnoses were associated with increased long COVID diagnosis risk in VA patients, with the strongest associations observed in younger individuals. Improved surveillance, treatment, and prevention for COVID-19 and its long-term sequelae should be considered for individuals with psychiatric conditions. © The Author(s), 2024.

If disorder A causally impacts on risk for disorder B, then genetic risk for disorder A should be lower in cases of disorder A with v. without a prior onset of B. Methods In all individuals (n = 905 736) born in Sweden from 1980 to 1990, from six psychiatric and drug use disorders (major depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia), we formed 14 pairs of disorders A and B. In these pairs, we compared, using Cox proportional hazards models, the predictive effect of the familial-genetic risk score (FGRS) for disorder B in those who had v. had not had a prior onset of disorder A. Results In all pairs, the impact of the FGRS for disorder B was significantly stronger in cases without v. with a prior history of disorder A. These effects were similar across sex, stable across levels of FGRS and not likely due to clinician bias. In many of our disorder pairs, previous clinical studies suggest a mechanism for a causal effect of disorder A on B. Conclusions Our findings provide indirect evidence that the occurrence of one psychiatric or substance use disorder often has a causal effect on risk for subsequent disorders.

Few studies implemented ML algorithms in internet-based depression treatment using baseline self-report data, but differing results hinder inferences on clinical practicability. This work compares algorithms using features gathered at baseline or early in treatment in their capability to predict non-response to a 6-week online program targeting depression. Methods Our training and test sample encompassed 1270 and 318 individuals, respectively. We trained random forest algorithms on self-report and process features gathered at baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment. Non-responders were defined as participants not fulfilling the criteria for reliable and clinically significant change on PHQ-9 post-treatment. Our benchmark models were logistic regressions trained on baseline PHQ-9 sum or PHQ-9 early change, using 100 iterations of randomly sampled 80/20 train-test-splits. Results Best performances were reached by our models involving early treatment characteristics (recall: 0.75-0.76; AUC: 0.71-0.77). Therapeutic alliance and early symptom change constituted the most important predictors. Models trained on baseline data were not significantly better than our benchmark. Conclusions Fair accuracies were only attainable by involving information from early treatment stages. In-treatment adaptation, instead of a priori selection, might constitute a more feasible approach for improving response when relying on easily accessible self-report features. Implementation trials are needed to determine clinical usefulness.  Copyright © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

However, few studies have explored affect dynamics in individuals in remission from depression, and results have been mixed. Methods A community sample of 18-year-olds (N = 345) completed diagnostic interviews and EMA probing emotions and low interest/motivation 5× daily for 2 weeks. Affect home base, variability, and inertia were compared across currently depressed, remitted, and never-depressed groups. Results Both depression groups had a higher negative affect (NA) and low interest/motivation home base, lower positive affect (PA) home base, greater variability of NA, PA, and low interest/motivation, and greater NA and low interest/motivation inertia than never-depressed participants. Additionally, the currently depressed group had a higher sad home base specifically, greater variability across most negative emotions and low interest/motivation, and greater low interest/motivation inertia than the remitted group. The currently depressed and remitted groups did not differ in anxious, upset, or PA home base, anxious or PA variability, and inertia of all negative emotions and PA. Conclusions Findings suggest that a number of abnormalities in emotion and reward functioning persist after a depressive episode resolves, however, the tendency to experience higher levels of sadness, greater range of a variety of negative emotions, and more variable and persistent low interest/motivation are exacerbated during depressive episodes. Conversely, greater intensity and persistence of some negative emotions (anxiety, upset) and blunted positive emotions appear to equally characterize depression in both the symptomatic and remitted state.

Previous studies have demonstrated its utility in retrospective evaluations across various settings. In this study, we explored the effect of different methodological choices in predictive modelling underlying the PAI. Methods Our approach involved a two-step procedure. First, we conducted a review of prior studies utilizing the PAI, evaluating each study using the Prediction model study Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST). We specifically assessed whether the studies adhered to two standards of predictive modeling: refraining from using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO CV) and preventing data leakage. Second, we examined the impact of deviating from these methodological standards in real data. We employed both a traditional approach violating these standards and an advanced approach implementing them in two large-scale datasets, PANIC-net (n = 261) and Protect-AD (n = 614). Results The PROBAST-rating revealed a substantial risk of bias across studies, primarily due to inappropriate methodological choices. Most studies did not adhere to the examined prediction modeling standards, employing LOO CV and allowing data leakage. The comparison between the traditional and advanced approach revealed that ignoring these standards could systematically overestimate the utility of the PAI. Conclusion Our study cautions that violating standards in predictive modeling may strongly influence the evaluation of the PAI's utility, possibly leading to false positive results. To support an unbiased evaluation, crucial for potential clinical application, we provide a low-bias, openly accessible, and meticulously annotated script implementing the PAI.

Non-adherence to antipsychotic medication is an important risk factor, but prospective studies investigating joint effects of antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines on suicidality are scarce. We aimed to investigate how use and non-use of psychotropic medications are associated with suicidality in schizophrenia. Methods An open cohort study followed all patients consecutively admitted to a psychiatric acute unit during a 10-year period with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 696). Cox multiple regression analyses were conducted with use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines as time-dependent variables. Adjustments were made for age, gender, depressive mood, agitated behavior, and use of alcohol and illicit substances. Results A total of 32 (4.6%) suicide events were registered during follow-up. Of these, 9 (28%) were completed suicides and 23 (72%) were attempted suicides. A total of 59 (8.5%) patients were readmitted with suicidal plans during the follow-up. Compared to non-use, use of antipsychotics was associated with 70% lower risk of attempted or completed suicide (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] = 0.30, p < 0.01, CI 0.14-0.65) and 69% reduced risk of readmission with suicidal plans (AHR = 0.31, p < 0.01, CI 0.18-0.55). Use of prescribed benzodiazepines was associated with 126% increased risk of readmission with suicidal plans (AHR = 2.26, p = 0.01, CI 1.24-4.13). Conclusions Adherence to antipsychotic medication is strongly associated with reduced suicidal risk in schizophrenia. The use of prescribed benzodiazepines was identified as a significant risk factor for being readmitted with suicidal plans.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

REM is disrupted in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and REM abnormalities after traumatic events increase the risk of developing PTSD. Therefore, it was hypothesized that abnormal REM in trauma-exposed individuals may pave the way for PTSD by interfering with the processing of extinction memory. In addition, PTSD patients display reduced vagal activity. Vagal activity contributes to the strengthening of memories, including fear extinction memory, and recent studies show that the role of vagus in memory processing extends to memory consolidation during sleep. Therefore, it is plausible that reduced vagal activity during sleep in trauma-exposed individuals may be an additional mechanism that impairs extinction memory consolidation. However, to date, the contribution of sleep vagal activity to the consolidation of extinction memory or any emotional memory has not been investigated. Methods Trauma-exposed individuals (n = 113) underwent a 2-day fear conditioning and extinction protocol. Conditioning and extinction learning phases were followed by extinction recall 24 h later. The association of extinction recall with REM characteristics and REM vagal activity (indexed as heart rate variability) during the intervening consolidation night was examined. Results Consistent with our hypotheses, REM disruption was associated with poorer physiological and explicit extinction memory. Furthermore, higher vagal activity during REM was associated with better explicit extinction memory, and physiological extinction memory in males. Conclusions These findings support the notion that abnormal REM, including reduced REM vagal activity, may contribute to PTSD by impairing the consolidation of extinction memory.

However, there are few studies of dynamic FC analysis, which can provide information about fluctuations in neural activity related to cognition and behavior. The goal of the present study was therefore to investigate the dynamic aspects of FC in adolescent MDD patients. Methods Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 94 adolescents with MDD and 78 healthy controls. Independent component analysis, a sliding-window approach, and graph-theory methods were used to investigate the potential differences in dynamic FC properties between the adolescent MDD patients and controls. Results Three main FC states were identified, State 1 which was predominant, and State 2 and State 3 which occurred less frequently. Adolescent MDD patients spent significantly more time in the weakly-connected and relatively highly-modularized State 1, spent significantly less time in the strongly-connected and low-modularized State 2, and had significantly higher variability of both global and local efficiency, compared to the controls. Classification of patients with adolescent MDD was most readily performed based on State 1 which exhibited disrupted intra- and inter-network FC involving multiple functional networks. Conclusions Our study suggests local segregation and global integration impairments and segregation-integration imbalance of functional networks in adolescent MDD patients from the perspectives of dynamic FC. These findings may provide new insights into the neurobiology of adolescent MDD. Copyright 2024 © The Author(s). Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

The interactive effects between different types of CAs and FEP on CT remain understudied. Methods One-hundred sixteen individuals with FEP (mean age = 23.8 ± 6.9 years, 34% females, 80.2% non-Affective FEP) and 98 healthy controls (HCs) (mean age = 24.4 ± 6.2 years, 43% females) reported the presence/absence of CA <17 years using an adapted version of the Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse (CECA.Q) and the Retrospective Bullying Questionnaire (RBQ) and underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Correlation analyses were used to assess associations between brain maps of CA and FEP effects. General linear models (GLMs) were performed to assess the interaction effects of CA and FEP on CT. Results Eighty-Three individuals with FEP and 83 HCs reported exposure to at least one CA. CT alterations in FEP were similar to those found in participants exposed to separation from parents, bullying, parental discord, household poverty, and sexual abuse (r = 0.50 to 0.25). Exposure to neglect (β =-0.24, 95% CI [-0.37 to-0.12], p = 0.016) and overall maltreatment (β =-0.13, 95% CI [-0.20 to-0.06], p = 0.043) were associated with cortical thinning in the right medial orbitofrontal region. Conclusions Cortical alterations in individuals with FEP are similar to those observed in the context of socio-environmental adversity.

We investigated whether depression and substance use (alcohol and/or other drugs) explain the association between partner suicide bereavement and suicide. Methods Linkage of nationwide, longitudinal data from Denmark for the period 1980-2016 facilitated a comparison of 22 668 individuals exposed to bereavement by a partner's suicide with 913 402 individuals bereaved by a partner's death due to other causes. Using causal mediation models, we estimated the degree to which depression and substance use (considered separately) mediated the association between suicide bereavement and suicide. Results Suicide-bereaved partners were found to have a higher risk of suicide (HRadj = 1.59, 95% CI 1.36-1.86) and of depression (ORadj 1.16, 95% CI 1.09-1.25) when compared to other-bereaved partners, but a lower risk of substance use (ORadj 0.83; 95% CI 0.78-0.88). An increased risk of suicide was found among any bereaved individuals with a depression diagnosis recorded post-bereavement (ORadj 3.92, 95% CI 3.55-4.34). Mediation analysis revealed that depression mediated 2% (1.68%; 95% CI 0.23%-3.14%; p = 0.024) of the association between suicide bereavement and suicide in partners when using bereaved controls. Conclusions Depression is a partial mediator of the association between suicide bereavement and suicide. Efforts to prevent and optimize the treatment of depression in suicide-bereaved people could reduce their suicide risk. Our findings might be conservative because we did not include cases of depression diagnosed in primary care.

Identifying the characteristics of patients who achieve recovery may assist in optimizing future treatment. This naturalistic cohort study investigated pre-therapy characteristics as predictors of recovery and improvement after IAPT therapy. Methods In a cohort of patients attending an IAPT service in South London, we recruited 263 participants and conducted a baseline interview to gather extensive pre-therapy characteristics. Bayesian prediction models and variable selection were used to identify baseline variables prognostic of good clinical outcomes. Recovery (primary outcome) was defined using (IAPT) service-defined score thresholds for both depression (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9]) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7]). Depression and anxiety outcomes were also evaluated as standalone (PHQ-9/GAD-7) scores after therapy. Prediction model performance metrics were estimated using cross-validation. Results Predictor variables explained 26% (recovery), 37% (depression), and 31% (anxiety) of the variance in outcomes, respectively. Variables prognostic of recovery were lower pre-treatment depression severity and not meeting criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder. Post-therapy depression and anxiety severity scores were predicted by lower symptom severity and higher ratings of health-related quality of life (EuroQol questionnaire [EQ5D]) at baseline. Conclusion Almost a third of the variance in clinical outcomes was explained by pre-treatment symptom severity scores. These constructs benefit from being rapidly accessible in healthcare services. If replicated in external samples, the early identification of patients who are less likely to recover may facilitate earlier triage to alternative interventions.

We tested whether the concentration and accumulation of health and social disadvantage forecasts deaths of despair, in New Zealand and Denmark. Methods We used nationwide administrative data. Our observation period was 10 years (NZ = July 2006-June 2016, Denmark = January 2007-December 2016). We identified all NZ-born and Danish-born individuals aged 25-64 in the last observation year (NZ = 1 555 902, Denmark = 2 541 758). We ascertained measures of disadvantage (public-hospital stays for physical- and mental-health difficulties, social-welfare benefit-use, and criminal convictions) across the first nine years. We ascertained deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol, and all other causes in the last year. Results Deaths of despair clustered within a population segment that disproportionately experienced multiple disadvantages. In both countries, individuals in the top 5% of the population in multiple health- and social-service sectors were at elevated risk for deaths from suicide, drugs, and alcohol, and deaths from other causes. Associations were evident across sex and age. Conclusions Deaths of despair are a marker of inequalities in countries beyond the U.S. with robust social-safety nets, nationwide healthcare, and strong pharmaceutical regulations. These deaths cluster within a highly disadvantaged population segment identifiable within health- and social-service systems.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Conversely, guidance of top-down attention by external predictive cues is intact. Yet, it is unknown whether this preserved ability can help PSZ encode more information in the presence of salient distractors. Methods We employed a visuospatial change-detection task using four Gabor patches with differing orientations in 66 PSZ and 74 healthy controls (HCS). Two Gabor patches flickered which were designated either as targets or distractors and either a predictive or a non-predictive cue was displayed to manipulate top-down attention, resulting in four conditions. Results We observed significant effects of group, salience and cue as well as significant interactions of salience by cue, group by salience and group by cue. Across all conditions, PSZ stored significantly less information in VWM than HCS. PSZ stored significantly less non-flickering than flickering information with a non-predictive cue. However, PSZ stored significantly more flickering and non-flickering information with a predictive cue. Conclusions Our findings indicate that control of attentional selection is impaired in schizophrenia. We demonstrate that additional top-down information significantly improves performance in PSZ. The observed deficit in attentional control suggests a disturbance of GABAergic inhibition in early visual areas. Moreover, our findings are indicative of a mechanism for enhancing attentional control in PSZ, which could be utilized by pro-cognitive interventions. Thus, the current paradigm is suitable to reveal both preserved and compromised cognitive component processes in schizophrenia.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

We investigated the longitudinal effect of prenatal risk factors (maternal behavior, medication complications) and perinatal risk factors (birth weight, medical complications) on frequency of PEs. We also examined the cumulative risk of prenatal/perinatal risk factors, and differences between transient PE, persistent PE, and controls. Methods The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study is a large child cohort (age 9-10 at baseline; n = 11 872 with PE data). PEs were measured longitudinally using the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief, Child version, and included only if reported as distressing. Mixed-effects models were used for analysis, controlling for random effects, and a substantial number of fixed-effects covariates. Results Urinary tract infection (β = 0.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03-0.19) and severe anemia (β = 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.29) increased frequency of distressing PEs in childhood. Number of prenatal complications increased frequency of PEs (β = 0.03, 95% CI 0.01-0.06) and risk of persistent PEs (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15). Maternal smoking was associated with an increased frequency of PEs (β = 0.11, 95% CI 0.04-0.18) and persistent PEs (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.04-1.66). Maternal substance use was a risk factor for a 48% increased risk of persistent PEs (OR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.08-2.01). Perinatal complications showed no effect on PEs. Conclusions This study provides evidence that certain prenatal medical complications (severe nausea, severe anemia), cumulative number of prenatal medical complications, and maternal behaviors (smoking during pregnancy), increased frequency of distressing PEs in childhood. Maternal smoking and substance use, as well as cumulative number of prenatal complications increased risk of persistent PEs.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

We compare the associations between environmental exposures during childhood/prior to disorder onset with the risk of developing SCZ and BD. Methods: We conducted a Swedish register-based nested case-control study using 4184 SCZ cases and 18 681 BD cases diagnosed 1988-2013. Cases were matched to five controls by birth year, birth region, and sex. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) for SCZ and BD for each exposure (severe childhood infections, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), substance use disorders (SUDs), urban birth/longest residence). Results: All SUD types were associated with very high risk (IRR 4.9-25.5), and all forms of ACEs with higher risk (IRR 1.5-4.3) for both disorders. In the mutually adjusted models, ACEs demonstrated slightly higher risk for BD (SCZ IRR 1.30, 1.19-1.42; BD IRR 1.49, 1.44-1.55), while for SUD, risk was higher for SCZ (SCZ IRR 9.43, 8.15-10.92; BD IRR 5.50, 5.15-5.88). Infections were associated with increased risk of BD (IRR 1.21, 1.17-1.26) but not SCZ. Urban birth and urban longest residence were associated with higher risk of SCZ (IRR 1.19, 1.03-1.37), while only the combination of urban birth and rural longest residence showed higher risk for BD (IRR 1.24, 1.13-1.35). Conclusions: There were both shared and unique environmental risk factors: SUDs and ACEs were risk factors for both disorders, while infections were more strongly associated with BD and urbanicity with SCZ.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

The employed treatment is a key element in the impact of the course of depression over the time. However, there is currently a gap of knowledge about the trajectories per treatment and related baseline factors. We aimed to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms and associated baseline characteristics for two treatment arms in a randomized clinical trial: treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU plus transdiagnostic group cognitive behavioral therapy (TAU + TDG-CBT). Methods Growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to identify trajectories of depressive symptoms over 12 months post-treatment. Logistic regression models were used to examine associations between baseline characteristics and trajectory class membership in 483 patients (TAU: 231; TAU + TDG-CBT: 251). Results We identified different patterns of symptom change in the randomized groups: two trajectories in TAU ('improvement' (71.4%) and 'no improvement' (28.6%)), and four trajectories in TAU + TDG-CBT ('recovery' (69.8%), 'late recovery' (5.95%), 'chronicity' (4.77%), and 'relapse' (19.44%)). Higher baseline symptom severity and comorbidity were associated with poorer treatment outcomes in both treatment groups and worse emotional regulation strategies were linked to the 'no improvement trajectory' in TAU. The TAU + TDG-CBT group demonstrated greater symptom reduction compared to TAU alone. Conclusions There is heterogeneity in treatment outcomes. Integration of TDG-CBT with TAU significantly improves symptom reduction compared to TAU alone. Patients with higher baseline severity and comorbidities show poorer outcomes. Identification of trajectories and related factors could assist clinicians in tailoring treatment strategies to optimize outcomes, particularly for patients with a worse prognosis.

However, little is known about the socio-demographic characteristics and mental health of parents with BIF. Methods A secondary data analysis of the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey 2014 was conducted. Logistic regression models were fitted to compare differences in socio-demographic, mental health and service-use characteristics between parents and non-parents with and without BIF, and to investigate if the relationship between parent status and mental health outcomes was modified by BIF status, sex, and employment. Results Data from 6872 participants was analyzed; 69.1% were parents. BIF parents had higher odds of common mental disorder, severe mental illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, self-harm/suicide and were more likely to see their General Practitioner (GP) and to receive mental health treatment than non-BIF parents. BIF parents did not have a higher prevalence of mental health problems than BIF non-parents. Being a parent, after adjusting for BIF status and other confounders, was associated with increased odds of having a common mental disorder, visits to see a GP and treatment for mental health. Female parents had higher odds of treatment for mental health problems. Conclusions Being a parent is associated with elevated rates of common mental disorders. There is a higher burden of mental health problems and service use in people with BIF.

The current study examines whether the association between delinquent peer affiliation (DPA) and disruptive behavior interacts with functional brain correlates of reward sensitivity in early onset male adolescents delinquents. Methods Childhood arrestees (n = 126, mean age = 17.7 [s.d. 1.6]) completed a DPA questionnaire, and participated in an fMRI study in which reward sensitivity was operationalized through responsiveness of the ventral striatum (VS), amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during the monetary incentive delay paradigm (reward anticipation and outcome). Symptoms of disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) were assessed through structured psychiatric interviews (Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children) with adolescents. Results DPA had a main effect on DBD symptoms. Adolescents with high VS reward responses showed a stronger significant positive association between DPA and DBD symptoms compared to low VS responders. No evidence for an interaction effect was found for the amygdala and mPFC. Post-hoc analyses revealed the positive association between DPA and DBD was only present in males, with a diminishing effect as age increased. Conclusions We found evidence for a biosocial interaction between DPA and reward sensitivity of the VS in relation to DBD symptom severity. This study provides the first evidence of an interaction effect between a brain mechanism and an environmental factor in relation to DBD symptoms, implying that susceptibility to influences of delinquent peers may intertwine with individual biological differences.

The long-term (>12 weeks post-infection) impact of COVID-19 on mental health, specifically in older adults, is unclear. We longitudinally assessed the association of COVID-19 with depression symptomatology in community-dwelling older adults with metabolic syndrome within the framework of the PREDIMED-Plus cohort. Methods Participants (n = 5486) aged 55-75 years were included in this longitudinal cohort. COVID-19 status (positive/negative) determined by tests (e.g. polymerase chain reaction severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, IgG) was confirmed via event adjudication (410 cases). Pre- and post-COVID-19 depressive symptomatology was ascertained from annual assessments conducted using a validated 21-item Spanish Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Multivariable linear and logistic regression models assessed the association between COVID-19 and depression symptomatology. Results COVID-19 in older adults was associated with higher post-COVID-19 BDI-II scores measured at a median (interquartile range) of 29 (15-40) weeks post-infection [fully adjusted β = 0.65 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-1.15; p = 0.011]. This association was particularly prominent in women (β = 1.38 points, 95% CI 0.44-2.33, p = 0.004). COVID-19 was associated with 62% increased odds of elevated depression risk (BDI-II ≥ 14) post-COVID-19 when adjusted for confounders (odds ratio; 95% CI 1.13-2.30, p = 0.008). Conclusions COVID-19 was associated with long-term depression risk in older adults with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome, particularly in women. Thus, long-term evaluations of the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and preventive public health initiatives are warranted in older adults.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

To date little is known about the role of treatment expectations and other placebo-like mechanisms in online settings compared to traditional face-to-face treatment. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed individual participant data from randomized clinical trials that compared online and face-to-face psychological interventions. Methods MEDLINE (Ovid) and PsycINFO (Ovid) were last searched on 2 February 2021. Randomized clinical trials of therapist guided online v. face-to-face psychological interventions for psychiatric or somatic conditions using a randomized controlled design were included. Titles, abstracts, and full texts of studies were independently screened by multiple observers. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline was followed. Authors of the matching trials were contacted for individual participant data. Ratings from the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire and the primary outcome measure from each trial were used to estimate the association between expectation ratings and treatment outcomes in online v. face-to-face interventions, using a mixed-effects model. Results Of 7045 screened studies, 62 full-text articles were retrieved whereof six studies fulfilled the criteria and provided individual participant data (n = 491). Overall, CEQ ratings predicted clinical outcomes (β = 0.27) at end of treatment with no moderating effect of treatment modality (online v. face-to-face). Conclusions Online treatment appears to be equally susceptible to expectancy effects as face-to-face therapy. This furthers our understanding of the importance of placebo-like factors in online treatment and may aid the improvement of healthcare in online settings. © The Author(s), 2023.

Based on an existing cognitive-behavioral treatment protocol, we developed a specialized group intervention for individuals with post-COVID-19 condition. The present study examines the feasibility, acceptance, and effectiveness of the program for inpatients in a neurological rehabilitation setting. Methods The treatment program comprises eight sessions and includes psychoeducational and experience-based interventions on common psychophysiological mechanisms of persistent somatic symptoms. A feasibility trial was conducted using a one-group design in a naturalistic setting. N = 64 inpatients with a history of mild COVID-19 that fulfilled WHO criteria for post-COVID-19 condition were enrolled. After each session, evaluation forms were completed and psychometric questionnaires on somatic and psychopathological symptom burden were collected pre- and post-intervention. Results The treatment program was well received by participants and therapists. Each session was rated as comprehensible and overall satisfaction with the sessions was high. Pre-post effect sizes (of standard rehabilitation incl. new treatment program; intention-to-treat) showed significantly reduced subjective fatigue (p < 0.05, dav = 0.33) and improved disease coping (ps < 0.05, dav = 0.33-0.49). Conclusions Our results support the feasibility and acceptance of the newly developed cognitive-behavioral group intervention for individuals with post-COVID-19 condition. Yet, findings have to be interpreted cautiously due to the lack of a control group and follow-up measurement, the small sample size, and a relatively high drop-out rate. © The Author(s), 2023.

However, it remains unclear whether these impairments are solely the consequence of chronic alcohol consumption or whether they could be a marker of vulnerability. Methods The present study implemented a family history approach to address this question for a key process of social cognition: theory of mind (ToM). Thirty healthy adults with a family history of AUD (FH+) and 30 healthy adults with a negative family history of AUD (FH-), matched for age, sex, and education level, underwent an fMRI cartoon-vignette paradigm assessing cognitive and affective ToM. Participants also completed questionnaires evaluating anxiety, depressive symptoms, childhood trauma, and alexithymia. Results Results indicated that FH+ individuals differed from FH- individuals on affective but not cognitive ToM processing, at both the behavioral and neural levels. At the behavioral level, the FH+ group had lower response accuracy for affective ToM compared with the FH- group. At the neural level, the FH+ group had higher brain activations in the left insula and inferior frontal cortex during affective ToM processing. These activations remained significant when controlling for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and childhood trauma. Conclusions These findings highlight difficulties during affective ToM processing among first-degree relatives of AUD patients, supporting the idea that some of the impairments exhibited by these patients may already be present before the onset of AUD and may be considered a marker of vulnerability.

Social cognition is a multidimensional construct consisting of four domains: 1. theory of mind, 2. emotion processing, 3. attributional style and 4. social perception. Metacognitive training (MCT) is an intervention designed to target cognitive biases in psychosis containing two modules addressing social cognition. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of MCT on social cognition and two of its domains: theory of mind and emotion processing. Ten electronic databases were scoured from 2007 to 1 February 2022 for MCT studies reporting social cognition outcomes for people with SSD (1050 identified, 282 assessed). Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d in R. Results Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis (nMCT = 212, ncontrol = 194). MCT had a small but positive effect on global social cognition (d = 0.28 [95% CI 0.07-0.49]) and theory of mind (d = 0.27 [95% CI 0.01-0.52]). MCT showed no evidence of an effect on emotion processing (d = 0.03 [95% CI -0.26 to 0.32]). Conclusion MCT has a small but significant effect on social cognition for people with SSD. Our results add to other recent meta-analyses showing significant effects of MCT on clinically relevant outcomes such as positive symptoms, cognitive biases and cognitive insight. We recommend that future studies on MCT report outcomes on all four domains of social cognition.

However, despite its importance, little is known about the protective factors for ASD children during the lockdowns. Methods Based on the Shanghai Autism Early Developmental Cohort, 188 ASD children with two visits before and after the strict Omicron lockdown were included; 85 children were lockdown-free, while 52 and 51 children were under the longer and the shorter durations of strict lockdown, respectively. We tested the association of the lockdown group with the clinical improvement and also the modulation effects of parent/family-related factors on this association by linear regression/mixed-effect models. Within the social brain structures, we examined the voxel-wise interaction between the grey matter volume and the identified modulation effects. Results Compared with the lockdown-free group, the ASD children experienced the longer duration of strict lockdown had less clinical improvement (β = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.19-0.79], p = 0.001) and this difference was greatest for social cognition (2.62 [0.94-4.30], p = 0.002). We found that this association was modulated by parental agreeableness in a protective way (-0.11 [-0.17 to -0.05], p = 0.002). This protective effect was enhanced in the ASD children with larger grey matter volumes in the brain's mentalizing network, including the temporal pole, the medial superior frontal gyrus, and the superior temporal gyrus. Conclusions This longitudinal neuroimaging cohort study identified that the parental agreeableness interacting with the ASD children's social brain development reduced the negative impact on clinical symptoms during the strict lockdown. © The Author(s), 2023.

Here, we aim to investigate the common and/or unique dynamic structure-function coupling patterns across major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ). Methods We quantified the dynamic structure-function coupling in 452 patients with psychiatric disorders (MDD/BD/SZ = 166/168/118) and 205 unaffected controls at three distinct brain network levels, such as global, meso-, and local levels. We also correlated dynamic structure-function coupling with the topological features of functional networks to examine how the structure-function relationship facilitates brain information communication over time. Results The dynamic structure-function coupling is preserved for the three disorders at the global network level. Similar abnormalities in the rich-club organization are found in two distinct functional configuration states at the meso-level and are associated with the disease severity of MDD, BD, and SZ. At the local level, shared and unique alterations are observed in the brain regions involving the visual, cognitive control, and default mode networks. In addition, the relationships between structure-function coupling and the topological features of functional networks are altered in a manner indicative of state specificity. Conclusions These findings suggest both transdiagnostic and illness-specific alterations in the dynamic structure-function relationship of large-scale brain networks across MDD, BD, and SZ, providing new insights and potential biomarkers into the neurodevelopmental basis underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits observed in these disorders.  © The Author(s), 2023.

This study aimed to investigate microstructural abnormalities in the cingulum bundle associated with NSSI and its clinical characteristics. Methods 130 individuals completed the study, including 35 healthy controls, 47 MDD patients with NSSI, and 48 MDD patients without NSSI. We used tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) with a region of interest (ROI) analysis to compare the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cingulum bundle across the three groups. receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was employed to evaluate the ability of the difficulties with emotion regulation (DERS) score and mean FA of the cingulum to differentiate between the groups. Results MDD patients with NSSI showed reduced cingulum integrity in the left dorsal cingulum compared to MDD patients without NSSI and healthy controls. The severity of NSSI was negatively associated with cingulum integrity (r = -0.344, p = 0.005). Combining cingulum integrity and DERS scores allowed for successful differentiation between MDD patients with and without NSSI, achieving a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 83%. Conclusions Our study highlights the role of the cingulum bundle in the development of NSSI in adolescents with MDD. The findings support a frontolimbic theory of emotion regulation and suggest that cingulum integrity and DERS scores may serve as potential early diagnostic tools for identifying MDD patients with NSSI. © The Author(s), 2023.

However, longitudinal research comparing depressive symptoms before and during the pandemic is lacking. Little is known about how the pandemic affected individuals with familial history of mental illness. The present study examines the impact of the pandemic on youth depressive symptoms, including offspring of parents with major mood and psychotic disorders. Methods Between March 2018 and February 2020, we measured depressive symptoms in 412 youth aged 5-25 years. We measured depressive symptoms again in 371 (90%) of these youth between April 2020 and May 2022. Two thirds (249) participants had a biological parent with a major mood or psychotic disorder. We tested the effect of the pandemic by comparing depression symptoms before and after March 2020. We examined age, sex, and family history as potential moderators. Results We found an overall small increase in youth depressive symptoms (b = 0.07, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.15, p = 0.062). This was driven by an increase in female youth without familial history of mental illness (b = 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.56, p = 0.001). There was no change in depressive symptoms among offspring of parents with mental illness or males. Conclusions Our results provide reassurance about the wellbeing of children of parents with mental illness during a period of restricted access to resources outside the family. Rather than increasing symptoms in established risk groups, the pandemic led to a redistribution of depression burden towards segments of the youth population that were previously considered to be low-risk.

While attention precedes behavior and guides higher-order cognitive processes, reward learning from an attentional perspective - the effects of prior reward-learning on subsequent attention allocation - has been mainly overlooked. Methods The present study explored the effects of reward-based attentional learning in depression using two separate, yet complimentary, studies. In study 1, participants with high (HD) and low (LD) levels of depression symptoms were trained to divert their gaze toward one type of stimuli over another using a novel gaze-contingent music reward paradigm - music played when fixating the desired stimulus type and stopped when gazing the alternate one. Attention allocation was assessed before, during, and following training. In study 2, using negative reinforcement, the same attention allocation pattern was trained while substituting the appetitive music reward for gazing the desired stimulus type with the removal of an aversive sound (i.e. white noise). Results In study 1 both groups showed the intended shift in attention allocation during training (online reward learning), while generalization of learning at post-training was only evident among LD participants. Conversely, in study 2 both groups showed post-training generalization. Results were maintained when introducing anxiety as a covariate, and when using a more powerful sensitivity analysis. Finally, HD participants showed higher learning speed than LD participants during initial online learning, but only when using negative, not positive, reinforcement. Conclusions Deficient generalization of learning characterizes the attentional system of HD individuals, but only when using reward-based positive reinforcement, not negative reinforcement.

This study investigated the neural correlates of context-dependent extinction recall and fear renewal in SAD, specifically in patients with intrusions in response to an etiologically relevant aversive social event. Methods During functional magnetic resonance imaging a two-day context-dependent fear conditioning paradigm was conducted in 54 patients with SAD and 54 healthy controls (HC). This included fear acquisition (context A) and extinction learning (context B) on one day, and extinction recall (context B) as well as fear renewal (contexts C and A) one day later. The main outcome measures were blood oxygen level-dependent responses in regions of interest and skin conductance responses. Results Patients with SAD showed reduced differential conditioned amygdala activation during extinction recall in the safe extinction context and during fear renewal in the acquisition context compared to HC. Patients with clinically relevant intrusions moreover exhibited hypoactivation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction learning, extinction recall, and fear renewal in a novel context, while amygdala activation more strongly decreased during extinction learning and increased during fear renewal in the acquisition context compared with patients without intrusions. Conclusions Our study provides first evidence that intrusions in SAD are associated with similar deficits in context-dependent regulation of conditioned fear via the vmPFC as previously demonstrated in posttraumatic stress disorder.

However, the neural mechanisms underlying such heterogeneity still need further investigation. This study aimed to explore the common and distinct functional brain abnormalities across different age groups of MDD patients from a large-sample, multicenter analysis. Methods The analyzed sample consisted of a total of 1238 individuals including 617 MDD patients (108 adolescents, 12-17 years old; 411 early-middle adults, 18-54 years old; and 98 late adults, > = 55 years old) and 621 demographically matched healthy controls (60 adolescents, 449 early-middle adults, and 112 late adults). MDD-related abnormalities in brain functional connectivity (FC) patterns were investigated in each age group separately and using the whole pooled sample, respectively. Results We found shared FC reductions among the sensorimotor, visual, and auditory networks across all three age groups of MDD patients. Furthermore, adolescent patients uniquely exhibited increased sensorimotor-subcortical FC; early-middle adult patients uniquely exhibited decreased visual-subcortical FC; and late adult patients uniquely exhibited wide FC reductions within the subcortical, default-mode, cingulo-opercular, and attention networks. Analysis of covariance models using the whole pooled sample further revealed: (1) significant main effects of age group on FCs within most brain networks, suggesting that they are decreased with aging; and (2) a significant age group × MDD diagnosis interaction on FC within the default-mode network, which may be reflective of an accelerated aging-related decline in default-mode FCs. Conclusions To summarize, these findings may deepen our understanding of the age-related biological and clinical heterogeneity in MDD.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

However, whether this finding holds true in individuals with depression remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between gray matter atrophy and normal connectome architecture at individual level in depression. Methods In this study, 297 patients with depression and 256 healthy controls (HCs) from two independent Chinese dataset were included: a discovery dataset (105 never-treated first-episode patients and matched 130 HCs) and a replication dataset (106 patients and matched 126 HCs). For each patient, individualized regional atrophy was assessed using normative model and brain regions whose structural connectome profiles in HCs most resembled the atrophy patterns were identified as putative epicenters using a backfoward stepwise regression analysis. Results In general, the structural connectome architecture of the identified disease epicenters significantly explained 44% (±16%) variance of gray matter atrophy. While patients with depression demonstrated tremendous interindividual variations in the number and distribution of disease epicenters, several disease epicenters with higher participation coefficient than randomly selected regions, including the hippocampus, thalamus, and medial frontal gyrus were significantly shared by depression. Other brain regions with strong structural connections to the disease epicenters exhibited greater vulnerability. In addition, the association between connectome and gray matter atrophy uncovered two distinct subgroups with different ages of onset.

This repetition undermines what we can learn from studying individual diagnostic constructs because it can obscure both disorder- and symptom-specific signals. However, these lost opportunities are currently veiled because symptom repetition in the DSM-5 has not been quantified. Method This descriptive study mapped the repetition among the 1419 symptoms described in 202 diagnoses of adult psychopathology in section II of the DSM-5. Over a million possible symptom comparisons needed to be conducted, for which we used both qualitative content coding and natural language processing. Results In total, we identified 628 distinct symptoms: 397 symptoms (63.2%) were unique to a single diagnosis, whereas 231 symptoms (36.8%) repeated across multiple diagnoses a total of 1022 times (median 3 times per symptom; range 2-22). Some chapters had more repetition than others: For example, every symptom of every diagnosis in the bipolar and related disorders chapter was repeated in other chapters, but there was no repetition for any symptoms of any diagnoses in the elimination disorders, gender dysphoria or paraphilic disorders. The most frequently repeated symptoms included insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and irritability - listed in 22, 17 and 16 diagnoses, respectively. Notably, the top 15 most frequently repeating diagnostic criteria were dominated by symptoms of major depressive disorder.

The increased risk of CVD in BD may be subserved by microvascular dysfunction. We examined coronary microvascular function in relation to youth BD. Methods Participants were 86 youth, ages 13-20 years (n = 39 BD, n = 47 controls). Coronary microvascular reactivity (CMVR) was assessed using quantitative T2 magnetic resonance imaging during a validated breathing-paradigm. Quantitative T2 maps were acquired at baseline, following 60-s of hyperventilation, and every 10-s thereafter during a 40-s breath-hold. Left ventricular structure and function were evaluated based on 12-15 short- and long-axis cardiac-gated cine images. A linear mixed-effects model that controlled for age, sex, and body mass index assessed for between-group differences in CMVR (time-by-group interaction). Results The breathing-paradigm induced a significant time-related increase in T2 relaxation time for all participants (i.e. CMVR; β = 0.36, p < 0.001). CMVR was significantly lower in BD v. controls (β = -0.11, p = 0.002). Post-hoc analyses found lower T2 relaxation time in BD youth after 20-, 30-, and 40 s of breath-holding (d = 0.48, d = 0.72, d = 0.91, respectively; all pFDR < 0.01). Gross left ventricular structure and function (e.g. mass, ejection fraction) were within normal ranges and did not differ between groups. Conclusion Youth with BD showed evidence of subclinically impaired coronary microvascular function, despite normal gross cardiac structure and function. These results converge with prior findings in adults with major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.

In the current study, we sought to understand OCD from a dimensional perspective by identifying multimodal neuroimaging patterns correlated with multiple phenotypic characteristics within the striatum-based circuits known to be affected by OCD. Methods Neuroimaging measurements of local functional and structural features and clinical information were collected from 110 subjects, including 51 patients with OCD and 59 healthy control subjects. Linked independent component analysis (LICA) and correlation analysis were applied to identify associations between local neuroimaging patterns across modalities (including gray matter volume, white matter integrity, and spontaneous functional activity) and clinical factors. Results LICA identified eight multimodal neuroimaging patterns related to phenotypic variations, including three related to symptoms and diagnosis. One imaging pattern (IC9) that included both the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation measure of spontaneous functional activity and white matter integrity measures correlated negatively with OCD diagnosis and diagnostic scales. Two imaging patterns (IC10 and IC27) correlated with compulsion symptoms: IC10 included primarily anatomical measures and IC27 included primarily functional measures. In addition, we identified imaging patterns associated with age, gender, and emotional expression across subjects. Conclusions We established that data fusion techniques can identify local multimodal neuroimaging patterns associated with OCD phenotypes. The results inform our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of compulsive behaviors and OCD diagnosis.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

The rapid weight loss induced by bariatric surgery is known to improve depressive symptoms dramatically, but preoperative depression diagnosis may also increase the risk for poor weight loss. Therefore, we investigated longitudinal associations between depression and inflammatory markers and their effect on weight loss and clinical outcomes in bariatric patients. Methods This longitudinal observational study of 85 patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery included 41 cases with depression and 44 controls. Before and 6 months after surgery, we assessed depression by clinical interview and measured serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10. Results Before surgery, depression diagnosis was associated with significantly higher serum hsCRP, IL-6, and IL-6/10 ratio levels after controlling for confounders. Six months after surgery, patients with pre-existing depression still had significantly higher inflammation despite demonstrating similar weight loss to controls. Hierarchical regression showed higher baseline hsCRP levels predicted poorer weight loss (β = -0.28, p = 0.01) but had no effect on depression severity at follow-up (β = -0.02, p = 0.9). Instead, more severe baseline depressive symptoms and childhood emotional abuse predicted greater depression severity after surgery (β = 0.81, p < 0.001; and β = 0.31, p = 0.001, respectively). Conclusions Depression was significantly associated with higher inflammation beyond the effect of obesity and other confounders. Higher inflammation at baseline predicted poorer weight loss 6 months after surgery, regardless of depression diagnosis. Increased inflammation, rather than depression, may drive poor weight loss outcomes among bariatric patients.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Maladaptive eating behavior and, specifically, limited intake of calorie-dense foods are resistant to change and contribute to poor long-term outcomes. This study is a preliminary examination of whether change in food choices during inpatient treatment is related to longer-term clinical course. Methods Individuals with AN completed a computerized Food Choice Task at the beginning and end of inpatient treatment to determine changes in high-fat and self-controlled food choices. Linear regression and longitudinal analyses tested whether change in task behavior predicted short-term outcome (body mass index [BMI] at discharge) and longer-term outcome (BMI and eating disorder psychopathology). Results Among 88 patients with AN, BMI improved significantly with hospital treatment (p < 0.001), but Food Choice Task outcomes did not change significantly. Change in high-fat and self-controlled choices was not associated with BMI at discharge (r = 0.13, p = 0.22 and r = 0.10, p = 0.39, respectively). An increase in the proportion of high-fat foods selected (β = 0.91, p = 0.02) and a decrease in the use of self-control (β = -1.50, p = 0.001) predicted less decline in BMI over 3 years after discharge. Conclusions Short-term treatment is associated with improvement in BMI but with no significant change, on average, in choices made in a task known to predict actual eating. However, the degree to which individuals increased high-fat choices during treatment and decreased the use of self-control over food choice were associated with reduced weight loss over the following 3 years, underscoring the need to focus on changing eating behavior in treatment of AN.

Research is needed to identify patient characteristics that moderate outcomes. Here, we characterized changes in cognition across brief DBT (DBT-6) v. a standard 12-month course (DBT-12) and examined whether cognition predicted self-harm outcomes in each arm. Methods In this secondary analysis of 240 participants in the FASTER study (NCT02387736), cognitive measures were administered at pre-treatment, after 6 months, and at 12 months. Self-harm was assessed from pre-treatment to 2-year follow-up. Multilevel models characterized changes in cognition across treatment. Generalized estimating equations examined whether pre-treatment cognitive performance predicted self-harm outcomes in each arm. Results Cognitive performance improved in both arms after 6 months of treatment, with no between-arm differences at 12-months. Pre-treatment inhibitory control was associated with different self-harm outcomes in DBT-6 v. DBT-12. For participants with average inhibitory control, self-harm outcomes were significantly better when assigned to DBT-12, relative to DBT-6, at 9-18 months after initiating treatment. In contrast, participants with poor inhibitory control showed better self-harm outcomes when assigned to brief DBT-6 v. DBT-12, at 12-24 months after initiating treatment. Conclusions This work represents an initial step toward an improved understanding of patient profiles that are best suited to briefer v. standard 12 months of DBT, but observed effects should be replicated in a waitlist-controlled study to confirm that they were treatment-specific. © The Author(s), 2023.

This very long-term follow-up study aimed to examine the diagnostic stability of FEP diagnoses, the baseline predictors of diagnostic change and the timing of diagnostic change. Methods This was a longitudinal and naturalistic study of 243 subjects with FEP who were assessed at baseline and reassessed after a mean follow-up of 21 years. The diagnostic stability of DSM-5 psychotic disorders was examined using prospective and retrospective consistencies, logistic regression was used to establish the predictors of diagnostic change, and survival analysis was used to compare time to diagnostic change across diagnostic categories. Results The overall diagnostic stability was 47.7%. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were the most stable diagnoses, with other categories having low stability. Predictors of diagnostic change to schizophrenia included a family history of schizophrenia, obstetric complications, developmental delay, poor premorbid functioning in several domains, long duration of untreated continuous psychosis, spontaneous dyskinesia, lack of psychosocial stressors, longer duration of index admission, and poor early treatment response. Most of these variables also predicted diagnostic change to bipolar disorder but in the opposite direction and with lesser effect sizes. There were no significant differences between specific diagnoses regarding time to diagnostic change. At 10-year follow-up, around 80% of the diagnoses had changed. Conclusions FEP diagnoses other than schizophrenia or bipolar disorder should be considered as provisional. Considering baseline predictors of diagnostic change may help to enhance diagnostic accuracy and guide therapeutic interventions. © The Author(s), 2023.

However, CT associations with dynamic affect fluctuations while considering differences in mean affect levels across CT status have been understudied. Methods 346 adults (age = 49.25 ± 12.55, 67.0% female) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety participated in ecological momentary assessment. Positive and negative affect (PA, NA) were measured five times per day for two weeks by electronic diaries. Retrospectively-reported CT included emotional neglect and emotional/physical/sexual abuse. Linear regressions determined associations between CT and affect fluctuations, controlling for age, sex, education, and mean affect levels. Results Compared to those without CT, individuals with CT reported significantly lower mean PA levels (Cohen's d = -0.620) and higher mean NA levels (d = 0.556) throughout the two weeks. CT was linked to significantly greater PA variability (d = 0.336), NA variability (d = 0.353), and NA autocorrelation (d = 0.308), with strongest effects for individuals reporting higher CT scores. However, these effects were entirely explained by differences in mean affect levels between the CT groups. Findings suggested consistency of results in adults with and without lifetime depressive/anxiety disorders and across CT types, with sexual abuse showing the smallest effects. Conclusions Individuals with CT show greater affective dysregulation during the two-week monitoring of emotional symptoms, likely due to their consistently lower PA and higher NA levels. It is essential to consider mean affect level when interpreting the impact of CT on affect dynamics. © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Despite recent developments in multivariate analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), molecular genetic investigations of these models have not been conducted. Methods Using IPT GWAS, we conducted confirmatory genomic structural equation models (GenomicSEM) to empirically evaluate dual-systems models of the genetic architecture of IPTs. Genetic correlations between dual-systems factors and relevant cortical and subcortical neuroimaging phenotypes (regional/structural volume, cortical surface area, cortical thickness) were estimated and compared. Results GenomicSEM dual-systems models underscored important sources of shared and unique genetic variance between top-down and bottom-up constructs. Specifically, a dual-systems genomic model consisting of sensation seeking and lack of self-control factors demonstrated distinct but related sources of genetic influences (rg = 0.60). Genetic correlation analyses provided evidence of differential associations between dual-systems factors and cortical neuroimaging phenotypes (e.g. lack of self-control negatively associated with cortical thickness, sensation seeking positively associated with cortical surface area). No significant associations were observed with subcortical phenotypes. Conclusions Dual-systems models of the genetic architecture of IPTs tested were consistent with study hypotheses, but associations with relevant neuroimaging phenotypes were mixed (e.g. no associations with subcortical volumes). Findings demonstrate the utility of dual-systems models for studying IPT genetic influences, but also highlight potential limitations as a framework for interpreting IPTs as endophenotypes for psychopathology.

Methods An observational cohort using data from ANTLER (N = 478), a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome was time to relapse using the retrospective CIS-R. Participants were followed for 12 months. Results Primary outcome was available for 468 participants. Time to relapse in those with more than five previous episodes of depression was shorter, hazard ratio (HR) 1.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.75) compared to people with two episodes; HR 1.57 (95% CI 1.01-2.43) after adjustment.

Therefore, this study focused on analyzing SSD and four types of FSS (fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia). Methods This population-based matched cohort study utilized Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) claims database to investigate the impact of SSD/FSS. The study included 2 615 477 newly diagnosed patients with SSD/FSS and matched comparisons from the NHI beneficiary registry. Healthcare utilization, mortality, medical expenditure, and medication usage were assessed as outcome measures. Statistical analysis involved Cox regression models for hazard ratios, generalized linear models for comparing differences, and adjustment for covariates. Results All SSD/FSS showed significantly higher adjusted hazard ratios for psychiatric hospitalization and all-cause hospitalization compared to the control group. All SSD/FSS exhibited significantly higher adjusted hazard ratios for suicide, and SSD was particularly high. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in all SSD/FSS. Medical costs were significantly higher for all SSD/FSS compared to controls. The usage duration of all psychiatric medications and analgesics was significantly higher in SSD/FSS compared to the control group.

TAU for total psychotic symptoms (PANSS), subjective recovery from psychosis, PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, and general health status. Signals of efficacy at 12-month were less pronounced but remained robust for PTSD symptoms and general health status. Conclusions The trial feasibility criteria were fully met, and EMDRp was associated with promising signals of efficacy on a range of valuable clinical outcomes. A larger-scale, multi-center trial of EMDRp is feasible and warranted. © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

A clinical decision support tool could guide patient selection to improve the overall response rate and avoid ineffective treatments with adverse effects. Initial small-scale, monocenter studies indicate that both structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) biomarkers may predict ECT outcome, but it is not known whether those results can generalize to data from other centers. The objective of this study was to develop and validate neuroimaging biomarkers for ECT outcome in a multicenter setting. Methods Multimodal data (i.e. clinical, sMRI and resting-state fMRI) were collected from seven centers of the Global ECT-MRI Research Collaboration (GEMRIC). We used data from 189 depressed patients to evaluate which data modalities or combinations thereof could provide the best predictions for treatment remission (HAM-D score © 7) using a support vector machine classifier. Results Remission classification using a combination of gray matter volume and functional connectivity led to good performing models with average 0.82-0.83 area under the curve (AUC) when trained and tested on samples coming from the three largest centers (N = 109), and remained acceptable when validated using leave-one-site-out cross-validation (0.70-0.73 AUC). Conclusions These results show that multimodal neuroimaging data can be used to predict remission with ECT for individual patients across different treatment centers, despite significant variability in clinical characteristics across centers. Future development of a clinical decision support tool applying these biomarkers may be feasible.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

A major contributor to premature death is cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated associations of (genetic liability for) depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia with a range of CVD traits and examined to what degree these were driven by important confounders. Methods We included participants of the Dutch Lifelines cohort (N = 147 337) with information on self-reported lifetime diagnosis of depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia and CVD traits. Employing linear mixed-effects models, we examined associations between mental illness diagnoses and CVD, correcting for psychotropic medication, demographic and lifestyle factors. In a subsample (N = 73 965), we repeated these analyses using polygenic scores (PGSs) for the three mental illnesses. Results There was strong evidence that depressive disorder diagnosis is associated with increased arrhythmia and atherosclerosis risk and lower heart rate variability, even after confounder adjustment. Positive associations were also found for the depression PGSs with arrhythmia and atherosclerosis. Bipolar disorder was associated with a higher risk of nearly all CVD traits, though most diminished after adjustment. The bipolar disorder PGSs did not show any associations. While the schizophrenia PGSs was associated with increased arrhythmia risk and lower heart rate variability, schizophrenia diagnosis was not. All mental illness diagnoses were associated with lower blood pressure and a lower risk of hypertension. Conclusions Our study shows widespread associations of (genetic liability to) mental illness (primarily depressive disorder) with CVD, even after confounder adjustment. Future research should focus on clarifying potential causal pathways between mental illness and CVD. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We examined if PEs in parents were associated with PEs in offspring. Methods As part of the Danish general population Lolland-Falster Health Study, families with youths aged 11-17 years were included. Both children and parents reported PEs according to the Psychotic Like Experiences Questionnaire, counting only 'definite' PEs. Parents additionally reported depressive symptoms, anxiety, and mental wellbeing. The associations between parental and child PEs were estimated using generalized estimating equations with an exchangeable correlation structure to account for the clustering of observations within families, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Results Altogether, 984 youths (mean age 14.3 years [s.d. 2.0]), 700 mothers, and 496 fathers from 766 households completed PEs-questionnaires. Offspring of parents with PEs were at an increased risk of reporting PEs themselves (mothers: adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 2.42, 95% CI 1.73-3.38; fathers: aRR 2.25, 95% CI 1.42-3.59). Other maternal problems (depression, anxiety, and poor mental well-being), but not paternal problems, were also associated with offspring PEs. In multivariate models adjusting for parental problems, PEs, but not other parental problems, were robustly associated with offspring PEs (mothers: aRR 2.25, 95% CI 1.60-3.19; fathers: aRR 2.44, 95% CI 1.50-3.96). Conclusions The current findings add novel evidence suggesting that specific psychosis vulnerability in families is expressed at the lower end of the psychosis continuum, underlining the importance of assessing youths' needs based on psychosis vulnerability broadly within the family systems. © The Author(s), 2023.

As there has been no report from Turkey, this study aimed to provide the treated incidence rate of first-episode psychosis (FEP) in a defined area. Methods All individuals, aged 15-64 years, presenting with FEP (ICD-10 F20-29, F30-33) to mental health services in a defined catchment-area in Sinop which is located in the Black Sea region of the northern Turkey were recorded over a 4-year period (2009 to 2012). Incidence rates of psychotic disorders and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. Poisson regression was applied to estimate the differences in incidence rate ratio (IRR) by age, sex, and urbanicity. Results One hundred and fifteen FEP participants were identified during the 4 years. Crude incidence rates of all psychoses, schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, and affective psychotic disorders were respectively 38.5 (95% CI 27.1-49.9), 10.7 (95% CI 6.6-14.8), 10.0 (95% CI 5.7-14.3) and 17.7 (95% CI 11.3-24.2) per 100 000 person-years. After age-sex standardisation the rates increased slightly. There were no gender differences in the incidence rates. IRR of any psychotic disorder was highest in the youngest age group (15-24 years) compared to the oldest age group (55-64 years), 7.9 (95% CI 2.8-30.5). In contrast with previous studies, the incidence rate of any psychotic disorder was not significantly increased in urban areas compared with rural areas. Conclusions The current study, the first of its kind from Turkey, indicates that the risk of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders in a lowly urbanised area of Turkey is comparable to those reported in Western European cities.

However, it has not yet been determined if genetic liability is conferred in part through associations with more proximal neurophysiological risk markers. Methods Participants from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism, a large, family-based study of alcohol use disorders were genotyped and polygenic scores for externalizing (EXT PGS) were calculated. Associations with target P3 amplitude from a visual oddball task (P3) and broad endorsement of externalizing behaviors (indexed via self-report of alcohol and cannabis use, and antisocial behavior) were assessed in participants of European (EA; N = 2851) and African ancestry (AA; N = 1402). Analyses were also stratified by age (adolescents, age 12-17 and young adults, age 18-32). Results The EXT PGS was significantly associated with higher levels of externalizing behaviors among EA adolescents and young adults as well as AA young adults. P3 was inversely associated with externalizing behaviors among EA young adults. EXT PGS was not significantly associated with P3 amplitude and therefore, there was no evidence that P3 amplitude indirectly accounted for the association between EXT PGS and externalizing behaviors. Conclusions Both the EXT PGS and P3 amplitude were significantly associated with externalizing behaviors among EA young adults. However, these associations with externalizing behaviors appear to be independent of each other, suggesting that they may index different facets of externalizing. © The Author(s), 2023.

The study's aims were to identify subgroups of persons with remitted MDDPsy with distinct trajectories of depression severity during continuation treatment and to detect predictors of membership to the worsening trajectory. Method One hundred and twenty-six persons aged 18-85 years participated in a 36-week randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) that examined the clinical effects of continuing olanzapine once an episode of MDDPsy had remitted with sertraline plus olanzapine. Latent class mixed modeling was used to identify subgroups of participants with distinct trajectories of depression severity during the RCT. Machine learning was used to predict membership to the trajectories based on participant pre-trajectory characteristics. Results Seventy-one (56.3%) participants belonged to a subgroup with a stable trajectory of depression scores and 55 (43.7%) belonged to a subgroup with a worsening trajectory. A random forest model with high prediction accuracy (AUC of 0.812) found that the strongest predictors of membership to the worsening subgroup were residual depression symptoms at onset of remission, followed by anxiety score at RCT baseline and age of onset of the first lifetime depressive episode. In a logistic regression model that examined depression score at onset of remission as the only predictor variable, the AUC (0.778) was close to that of the machine learning model. Conclusions Residual depression at onset of remission has high accuracy in predicting membership to worsening outcome of remitted MDDPsy. Research is needed to determine how best to optimize the outcome of psychotic MDDPsy with residual symptoms. © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

However, whether the associations reflect a causal effect is harder to establish. Methods To examine associations between educational duration and specific aspects of well-being, anxiety and mood disorders, and cardiovascular health in a sample of European Ancestry UK Biobank participants born in England and Wales, we apply four different causal inference methods (a natural policy experiment leveraging the minimum school-leaving age, a sibling-control design, Mendelian randomization [MR], and within-family MR), and assess if the methods converge on the same conclusion. Results A comparison of results across the four methods reveals that associations between educational duration and these outcomes appears predominantly to be the result of confounding or bias rather than a true causal effect of education on well-being and health outcomes. Although we do consistently find no associations between educational duration and happiness, family satisfaction, work satisfaction, meaning in life, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, we do not find consistent significant associations across all methods for the other phenotypes (health satisfaction, depression, financial satisfaction, friendship satisfaction, neuroticism, and cardiovascular outcomes). Conclusions We discuss inconsistencies in results across methods considering their respective limitations and biases, and additionally discuss the generalizability of our findings in light of the sample and phenotype limitations. Overall, this study strengthens the idea that triangulation across different methods is necessary to enhance our understanding of the causal consequences of educational duration. © The Author(s), 2023.

Both schizotypy and childhood trauma are linked to structural brain alterations, and it is possible that trauma exposure moderates the extent of brain morphological differences associated with schizotypy. Methods We addressed this question using data from a total of 1182 healthy adults (age range: 18-65 years old, 647 females/535 males), pooled from nine sites worldwide, contributing to the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Schizotypy working group. All participants completed both the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire Brief version (SPQ-B), and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and underwent a 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scan from which regional indices of subcortical gray matter volume and cortical thickness were determined. Results A series of multiple linear regressions revealed that differences in cortical thickness in four regions-of-interest were significantly associated with interactions between schizotypy and trauma; subsequent moderation analyses indicated that increasing levels of schizotypy were associated with thicker left caudal anterior cingulate gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus and insula, and thinner left caudal middle frontal gyrus, in people exposed to higher (but not low or average) levels of childhood trauma. This was found in the context of morphological changes directly associated with increasing levels of schizotypy or increasing levels of childhood trauma exposure. Conclusions These results suggest that alterations in brain regions critical for higher cognitive and integrative processes that are associated with schizotypy may be enhanced in individuals exposed to high levels of trauma. © The Author(s), 2023.

However, the association between weight change after the diagnosis of depression and the risk of dementia is poorly established. This study aimed to investigate the association between weight change before and after a diagnosis of depression with the subsequent risk of dementia. Methods The National Health Insurance Sharing Service database was used. 1 308 730 patients aged ≤40 years diagnosed with depression were identified to be eligible. Weight changes after their depression diagnosis were categorized and subsequent incidence of dementia was followed up. Results During an average follow-up period of 5.2 years (s.d., 2.0 years), 69 373 subjects were newly diagnosed with all-cause dementia (56 351 were Alzheimer's disease and 6877 were vascular dementia). Regarding all outcomes, compared to those with a minimal weight change (-5 to 5%), all groups with weight gain or loss showed increased risks of dementia after adjusting potential risk factors for dementia, in all analysis models with a dose-response relationship, showing a U-shaped association.

However, underlying neurobiological mechanisms and corresponding biomarkers remain unexplored. This study aimed to investigate if global and (sub)cortical brain structures, along with brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) reflect illness progression as conceptualized in these staging models, potentially identifying brain-PAD as a biomarker for BD staging. Methods In total, 199 subjects with bipolar-I-disorder and 226 control subjects from the Dutch Bipolar Cohort with a high-quality T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan were analyzed. Global and (sub)cortical brain measures and brain-PAD (the difference between biological and chronological age) were estimated. Associations between individual brain measures and the stages of both staging models were explored. Results A higher brain-PAD (higher biological age than chronological age) correlated with an increased likelihood of being in a higher stage of the inter-episodic functioning model, but not in the model based on number of mood episodes. However, after correcting for the confounding factors lithium-use and comorbid anxiety, the association lost significance. Global and (sub)cortical brain measures showed no significant association with the stages. Conclusions These results suggest that brain-PAD may be associated with illness progression as defined by impaired inter-episodic functioning. Nevertheless, the significance of this association changed after considering lithium-use and comorbid anxiety disorders. Further research is required to disentangle the intricate relationship between brain-PAD, illness stages, and lithium intake or anxiety disorders. This study provides a foundation for potentially using brain-PAD as a biomarker for illness progression. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine whether self-stigma mitigates the adverse effects of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms on the help-seeking behaviours of Syrian adolescents living in Turkey. Methods The participants of this study included 488 Syrian refugee adolescents (boys, 63.73%; girls, 3627%) living in Turkey. Participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and General Help-Seeking Scale and Self-Stigma of Seeking Psychology Help Scale. Results The findings revealed that stress (β = 0.19, p < 0.01), anxiety (β = 0.12, p < 0.05), and depression (β = 0.17, p < 0.01) had significant and positive predictive effects on self-stigma, but not on help-seeking behaviours. Also, self-stigma (β = -0.12, p < 0.01) had a significant negative predictive effect on help-seeking behaviours. With regard to the indirect effects, the findings showed that self-stigma fully mediated the associations between stress - help-seeking [effect = -0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.11 to -0.01], anxiety - help-seeking (effect = -0.04, 95% CI -0.09 to -0.01)], and depression - help-seeking (effect = -0.05, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.01). Conclusions Our findings highlight the potential negative effects of self-stigma on the help-seeking behaviours of Syrian refugee adolescents, both directly and indirectly.

This study explored temporal trends in the recorded incidence of CMD in the United Kingdom. Methods We used data from general practices in the United Kingdom (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) to estimate the annual recorded incidence of CMD for 2000-2020, including symptoms, diagnosis, or pharmaceutical treatment. Trends were explored by sex, age, ethnicity, region, deprivation, and comorbidity. Results We included 29 480 164 individuals who were followed up for 12.5 years on average (s.d. = 6.4 years). The recorded incidence of CMD episodes was 55.9 per 1000 person-years in 2000 [95% confidence interval (CI) 55.8-56.1], increasing to 79.6 per 1000 person-years in 2019 (95% CI 79.5-79.8). Females had higher recorded incidence rates, as did those living in more deprived areas. We observed striking patterns by age over time, with rates in ages 16-24 increasing from 40.2 per 1000 in 2000 (95% CI 39.8-40.5), to 107.8 per 1000 in 2019 (95% CI 107.0-108.6). In contrast, the rates in those aged ≥55 years decreased since 2014. There were differing patterns of incidence by ethnic group, with a steeper increase in Asian, Black, and mixed groups in recent years. Conclusions Overall, the incidence of recorded CMD in the UK general practice increased between 2000 and 2019 with a small decrease in 2020. The overall trends obscured important differences across population subgroups, which may have implications for prevention.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Whether cannabidiol (CBD) has ameliorative effects on hippocampal blood flow (rCBF) in CHR patients remains unknown. Methods Using a double-blind, parallel-group design, 33 CHR patients were randomized to a single oral 600 mg dose of CBD or placebo; 19 healthy controls did not receive any drug. Hippocampal rCBF was measured using Arterial Spin Labeling. We examined differences relating to CHR status (controls v. placebo), effects of CBD in CHR (placebo v. CBD) and linear between-group relationships, such that placebo > CBD > controls or controls > CBD > placebo, using a combination of hypothesis-driven and exploratory wholebrain analyses. Results Placebo-treated patients had significantly higher hippocampal rCBF bilaterally (all pFWE<0.01) compared to healthy controls. There were no suprathreshold effects in the CBD v. placebo contrast. However, we found a significant linear relationship in the right hippocampus (pFWE = 0.035) such that rCBF was highest in the placebo group, lowest in controls and intermediate in the CBD group. Exploratory wholebrain results replicated previous findings of hyperperfusion in the hippocampus, striatum and midbrain in CHR patients, and provided novel evidence of increased rCBF in inferior-temporal and lateral-occipital regions in patients under CBD compared to placebo. Conclusions These findings suggest that hippocampal blood flow is elevated in the CHR state and may be partially normalized by a single dose of CBD. CBD therefore merits further investigation as a potential novel treatment for this population. © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Research on sick leave over a patient journey of individuals who received one of two treatment approaches - either behavioral (BT) or psychodynamic (PDT) psychotherapy - is scarce. Methods We conducted a cohort study on anonymized German claims data for propensity-score matched patients who received short-term outpatient BT or PDT. We analyzed sick leave days and direct health care costs one year before, during, and one year after psychotherapy. Results We analyzed data of patients who received BT and PDT, with N = 14 530 patients per group after matching. Patients showed sick leave days per person year of 33.66 and 35.05 days before, 35.99 and 39.74 days during, and 20.03 and 20.95 days after BT and PDT, respectively. Sick leave rates were overall higher in patients who received PDT. Both patient groups showed reductions of roughly 14 sick leave days per year, or 40%, from before to after therapy without a difference between BT and PDT (difference-in-difference [DiD] = -0.48, 95%-confidence interval [CI] -1.61 to 0.68). Same applies to direct health care costs which reduced in both groups by roughly 1800 EUR (DiD = 0, 95%-CI -158 to 157). Conclusions Results suggest similar reductions in sick leave days and direct health care costs from before to after BT and PDT. As sick leave is discussed to serve as an indicator of overall health and functioning in mental disorders, both treatments may have a similar positive impact on mental health. © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods Adolescents (N = 1094, ages 13 to 18) with one or more suicide risk factors were enrolled and invited to complete bi-weekly, 8-10 item text message surveys for 18 months. Adolescents who reported a suicide attempt (survey item) were invited to participate in an interview regarding their thoughts, feelings/emotions, and behaviors/events during the 24-hours prior to their attempt (case period) and a prior 24-hour period (control period). Their parents participated in an interview regarding the adolescents' behaviors/events during these same periods.

Experience sampling method collects subjective time-series data of patients' experiences, behavior, and context. At the same time, digital devices allow for less intrusive collection of more objective time-series data with higher sampling frequencies and for prolonged sampling periods. We refer to these data as parallel data. Combining these two data types holds the promise to revolutionize health care. However, existing ambulatory monitoring guidelines are too specific to each data type, and lack overall directions on how to effectively combine them. Methods Literature and expert opinions were integrated to formulate relevant guiding principles. Results Experience sampling and parallel data must be approached as one holistic time series right from the start, at the study design stage. The fluctuation pattern and volatility of the different variables of interest must be well understood to ensure that these data are compatible. Data have to be collected and operationalized in a manner that the minimal common denominator is able to answer the research question with regard to temporal and disease severity resolution. Furthermore, recommendations are provided for device selection, data management, and analysis. Open science practices are also highlighted throughout. Finally, we provide a practical checklist with the delineated considerations and an open-source example demonstrating how to apply it.

Methods Multiple Swedish nationwide registers were used to identify 8045 individuals, aged 20-29, with an incident diagnosis of ADHD 2006-2011. Labour market integration was conceptualized according to the core-peripheral model as a continuum from a strong (core) to a weak (peripheral) connection to the labour market. Sequence analyses categorized clusters of labour market integration, from 1 year before to 5 years after their ADHD diagnosis for individuals diagnosed with ADHD and a matched control group without ADHD. Multinomial logistic regression computed odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between sociodemographic factors and comorbid disorders and the identified clusters. Results About one-fourth of the young adults diagnosed with ADHD belonged to clusters characterized by a transition to a mainly peripheral labour market position, which was approximately four-times higher compared to controls without ADHD. Foremost, those living in small cities/villages (OR 1.9; CI 1.5-2.2), those having comorbid autism-spectrum disorder (OR 13.7; CI 6.8-27.5) or schizophrenia/psychoses (OR 7.8; CI 3.8-15.9) were associated with a transition towards a peripheral labour market position throughout the study period. Those with a high educational level (OR 0.1; CI 0.1-0.1), and men (OR 0.7; CI 0.6-0.8) were less likely to have a peripheral labour market position. Conclusions Young adults diagnosed with ADHD are four-times more likely to be in the peripheral labour market position compared to those without ADHD. To increase labour market participation, special attention is warranted to those with low educational level, those living outside big cities and those with comorbid mental disorders. © The Author(s), 2023.

Physical disability sometimes co-occurs with chronic pain but may also represent an independent risk factor for opioid misuse. However, previous research has not disentangled whether disability contributes to risk independent of chronic pain. Methods Here, we estimate the independent and joint adjusted associations between having a physical disability and co-occurring chronic pain condition at time of Medicaid enrollment on subsequent 18-month risk of incident opioid use disorder (OUD) and non-fatal, unintentional opioid overdose among non-elderly, adult Medicaid beneficiaries (2016-2019). Results We find robust evidence that having a physical disability approximately doubles the risk of incident OUD or opioid overdose, and physical disability co-occurring with chronic pain increases the risks approximately sixfold as compared to having neither chronic pain nor disability. In absolute numbers, those with neither a physical disability nor chronic pain condition have a 1.8% adjusted risk of incident OUD over 18 months of follow-up, those with physical disability alone have an 2.9% incident risk, those with chronic pain alone have a 3.6% incident risk, and those with co-occurring physical disability and chronic pain have a 11.1% incident risk. Conclusions These findings suggest that those with a physical disability should receive increased attention from the medical and healthcare communities to reduce their risk of opioid misuse and attendant negative outcomes. © The Author(s), 2023.

However, research is limited, and it remains unknown what etiologic factors account for observed associations. This was the first study to examine how EDs and dimensional ED symptoms (e.g. body dissatisfaction, binge eating) are phenotypically and etiologically associated with gastrointestinal disease in a large, population-based twin sample. Methods Adult female (N = 2980) and male (N = 2903) twins from the Michigan State University Twin Registry reported whether they had a lifetime ED (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder) and completed a measure of dimensional ED symptoms. We coded the presence/absence of lifetime gastrointestinal disease (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease) based on responses to questions regarding chronic illnesses and medications. We first examined whether twins with gastrointestinal disease had higher rates of EDs and ED symptoms, then used correlated factors twin models to investigate genetic and environmental contributions to the overlap between disorders. Results Twins with gastrointestinal disease had significantly greater dimensional ED symptoms (β = 0.21, p < 0.001) and odds of a lifetime ED (OR 2.90, p = 0.001), regardless of sex. Shared genetic factors fully accounted for the overlap between disorders, with no significant sex differences in etiologic associations. Conclusions Comorbidity between EDs and gastrointestinal disease may be explained by overlap in genetic influences, potentially including inflammatory genes implicated in both types of disorders. Screening for gastrointestinal disease in people with EDs, and EDs in those with gastrointestinal disease, is warranted. © The Author(s), 2023.

Previous case-control studies have investigated group-level differences in structural abnormalities, although the study design cannot account for interindividual differences. Recent research has focused on the association between the heterogeneity of the cerebral cortex morphometric features and clinical heterogeneity. Methods We used neuroimaging data from 420 healthy controls and 695 patients with SCZ from seven studies. Four cerebral cortex measures were obtained: surface area, gray matter volume, thickness, and local gyrification index. We calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) and person-based similarity index (PBSI) scores and performed group comparisons. Associations between the PBSI scores and cognitive functions were evaluated using Spearman's rho test and normative modeling. Results Patients with SCZ had a greater CV of surface area and cortical thickness than those of healthy controls. All PBSI scores across cortical measures were lower in patients with SCZ than in HCs. In the patient group, the PBSI scores for gray matter volume and all cortical measures taken together positively correlated with the full-scale IQ scores. Patients with deviant PBSI scores for gray matter volume and all cortical measures taken together had lower full-scale IQ scores than those of other patients. Conclusions The cerebral cortex in patients with SCZ showed greater regional and global structural variability than that in healthy controls. Patients with deviant similarity of cortical structural profiles exhibited a lower general intelligence than those exhibited by the other patients.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Therefore, enhancing fear extinction learning has immense potential emotional and health benefits. Mindfulness training enhances both fear conditioning and recall of extinguished fear; however, its effects on fear extinction learning are unknown. Here we investigated the impact of mindfulness training on brain mechanisms associated with fear-extinction learning, compared to an exercise-based program. Methods We investigated BOLD activations in response to a previously learned fear-inducing cue during an extinction paradigm, before and after an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR, n = 49) or exercise-based stress management education program (n = 27). Results The groups exhibited similar reductions in stress, but the MBSR group was uniquely associated with enhanced activation of salience network nodes and increased hippocampal engagement. Conclusions Our results suggest that mindfulness training increases attention to anticipatory aversive stimuli, which in turn facilitates decreased aversive subjective responses and enhanced reappraisal of the memory.

We aimed to clarify this complex relationship, considering sex differences, temporal factors, and underlying etiologic pathways. Methods We used Swedish longitudinal national registry data for a cohort born 1960-1990 that was registered as married between 1978 and 2018 (N = 1 601 075). We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the association between divorce and suicide attempt. To assess whether observed associations were attributable to familial confounders or potentially causal in nature, we conducted co-relative analyses. Results In the overall sample and in sex-stratified analyses, divorce was associated with increased risk of suicide attempt (adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] 1.66-1.77). Risk was highest in the year immediately following divorce (HRs 2.20-2.91) and declined thereafter, but remained elevated 5 or more years later (HRs 1.41-1.51). Divorcees from shorter marriages were at higher risk for suicide attempt than those from longer marriages (HRs 3.33-3.40 and 1.20-1.36, respectively). In general, HRs were higher for divorced females than for divorced males. Co-relative analyses suggested that familial confounders and a causal pathway contribute to the observed associations. Conclusions The association between divorce and risk of suicide attempt is complex, varying as a function of sex and time-related variables. Given evidence that the observed association is due in part to a causal pathway from divorce to suicide attempt, intervention or prevention efforts, such as behavioral therapy, could be most effective early in the divorce process, and in particular among females and those whose marriages were of short duration.  © The Author(s), 2023.

We developed a predictive algorithm to identify students at risk of suicidal behavior and used telehealth to reduce subsequent risk. Methods Data come from several waves of a prospective cohort study (2016-2022) of college students (n = 5454). All first-year students were invited to participate as volunteers. (Response rates range: 16.00-19.93%). A stepped-care approach was implemented: (i) all students received a comprehensive list of services; (ii) those reporting past 12-month suicidal ideation were directed to a safety planning application; (iii) those identified as high risk of suicidal behavior by the algorithm or reporting 12-month suicide attempt were contacted via telephone within 24-h of survey completion. Intervention focused on support/safety-planning, and referral to services for this high-risk group. Results 5454 students ranging in age from 17-36 (s.d. = 5.346) participated; 65% female. The algorithm identified 77% of students reporting subsequent suicidal behavior in the top 15% of predicted probabilities (Sensitivity = 26.26 [95% CI 17.93-36.07]; Specificity = 97.46 [95% CI 96.21-98.38], PPV = 53.06 [95% CI 40.16-65.56]; AUC range: 0.895 [95% CIs 0.872-0.917] to 0.966 [95% CIs 0.939-0.994]). High-risk students in the Intervention Cohort showed a 41.7% reduction in probability of suicidal behavior at 12-month follow-up compared to high-risk students in the Control Cohort. Conclusions Predictive risk algorithms embedded into universal screening, coupled with telehealth intervention, offer significant potential as a suicide prevention approach for students.

We investigated whether childhood reading for pleasure (RfP) was related to young adolescent assessments of cognition, mental health, and brain structure. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional and longitudinal study in a large-scale US national cohort (10 000 + young adolescents), using the well-established linear mixed model and structural equation methods for twin study, longitudinal and mediation analyses. A 2-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis for potential causal inference was also performed. Important factors including socio-economic status were controlled. Results Early-initiated long-standing childhood RfP (early RfP) was highly positively correlated with performance on cognitive tests and significantly negatively correlated with mental health problem scores of young adolescents. These participants with higher early RfP scores exhibited moderately larger total brain cortical areas and volumes, with increased regions including the temporal, frontal, insula, supramarginal; left angular, para-hippocampal; right middle-occipital, anterior-cingulate, orbital areas; and subcortical ventral-diencephalon and thalamus. These brain structures were significantly related to their cognitive and mental health scores, and displayed significant mediation effects. Early RfP was longitudinally associated with higher crystallized cognition and lower attention symptoms at follow-up. Approximately 12 h/week of youth regular RfP was cognitively optimal. We further observed a moderately significant heritability of early RfP, with considerable contribution from environments. MR analysis revealed beneficial causal associations of early RfP with adult cognitive performance and left superior temporal structure. Conclusions These findings, for the first time, revealed the important relationships of early RfP with subsequent brain and cognitive development and mental well-being.

To examine this, we tested whether the duration of attenuated psychotic symptom (APS) worsening prior to baseline moderated performance of the North American prodrome longitudinal study 2 (NAPLS2) risk calculator. We also examined whether rates of cortical thinning, another marker of illness progression, bolstered clinical prediction models. Methods Participants from both the NAPLS2 and NAPLS3 samples were classified as either 'long' or 'short' symptom duration based on time since APS increase prior to baseline. The NAPLS2 risk calculator model was applied to each of these groups. In a subset of NAPLS3 participants who completed follow-up magnetic resonance imaging scans, change in cortical thickness was combined with the individual risk score to predict conversion to psychosis. Results The risk calculator models achieved similar performance across the combined NAPLS2/NAPLS3 sample [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.69], the long duration group (AUC = 0.71), and the short duration group (AUC = 0.71). The shorter duration group was younger and had higher baseline APS than the longer duration group. The addition of cortical thinning improved the prediction of conversion significantly for the short duration group (AUC = 0.84), with a moderate improvement in prediction for the longer duration group (AUC = 0.78). Conclusions These results suggest that early illness progression differs among CHR-P patients, is detectable with both clinical and neuroimaging measures, and could play an essential role in the prediction of clinical outcomes.

Ultra-brief treatments overcome some of these barriers by delivering therapeutic information and skills using significantly less time than standard-length treatments. We developed a therapist-guided online ultra-brief treatment for depression and anxiety and compared it to an existing 8-week, 5-lesson therapist-guided standard-length treatment and a waitlist control. Methods In a randomized controlled trial, adults with self-reported depression or anxiety were randomized (1:1:1) to the ultra-brief treatment, standard-length treatment, or waitlist control. The primary outcomes were depression symptoms and anxiety symptoms assessed at baseline, 5-weeks later, 9-weeks later (primary timepoint), and 3-months later. The trial was prospectively registered. Results Between 7 February 2022, and 16 August 2022, 242 participants were enrolled in the ultra-brief treatment (n = 85), standard-length treatment (n = 80), and waitlist control (n = 77). Participants were mostly women with an average age of 48.56 years. At 9-weeks post-baseline, participants in the ultra-brief treatment group reported significantly lower depression (between groups d = 0.41) and anxiety (d = 0.53) than the waitlist control. The ultra-brief treatment was non-inferior for anxiety at both 9-weeks and 3-months follow-up. Non-inferiority for depression was observed at 9-weeks. Conclusions The online ultra-brief treatment resulted in significant reductions in depression and anxiety that were non-inferior to a longer treatment course after 9-weeks. Remotely delivered ultra-brief treatments have the potential to provide accessible and effective care for those who cannot, or would prefer not to, access longer psychological interventions.

For the present study, we recruited a diverse online sample to provide estimates for nine subtypes of BFRBs and body-focused repetitive disorders (BFRDs). Methods The final sample comprised 1481 individuals from the general population. Several precautions were taken to recruit a diverse sample and to exclude participants with low reliability. We matched participants on gender, race, education and age range to allow unbiased interpretation. Results While almost all participants acknowledged at least one BFRB in their lifetime (97.1%), the rate for BFRDs was 24%. Nail biting (11.4%), dermatophagia (8.7%), skin picking (8.2%), and lip-cheek biting (7.9%) were the most frequent BFRDs. Whereas men showed more lifetime BFRBs, the rate of BFRDs was higher in women than in men. Rates of BFRDs were low in older participants, especially after the age of 40. Overall, BFRBs and BFRDs were more prevalent in White than in non-White individuals. Education did not show a strong association with BFRB/BFRDs. Discussion BFRBs are ubiquitous. More severe forms, BFRDs, manifest in approximately one out of four people. In view of the often-irreversible somatic sequelae (e.g. scars) BFRBs/BFRDs deserve greater diagnostic and therapeutic attention by clinicians working in both psychology/psychiatry and somatic medicine (especially dermatology and dentistry).  © The Author(s), 2023.

We hypothesize that neuroanatomical deficits will be related to higher inflammation, greater childhood adversity, and worse psychiatric symptoms in BDII-D. Methods Voxel- and surface-based morphometry was performed using the CAT toolbox in 150 BDII-D patients and 155 healthy controls (HCs). Partial Pearson correlations followed by multiple comparison correction was used to indicate significant relationships between neuroanatomy and inflammation, childhood adversity, and psychiatric symptoms. Results Compared with HCs, the BDII-D group demonstrated significantly smaller gray matter volumes (GMVs) in frontostriatal and fronto-cerebellar area, insula, rectus, and temporal gyrus, while significantly thinner cortices were found in frontal and temporal areas. In BDII-D, smaller GMV in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) was correlated with greater sexual abuse (r = -0.348, q < 0.001) while larger GMV in the right orbital MFG was correlated with greater physical neglect (r = 0.254, q = 0.03). Higher WBC count (r = -0.227, q = 0.015) and IL-6 levels (r = -0.266, q = 0.015) was associated with smaller GMVs in fronto-cerebellar area in BDII-D. Greater positive symptoms was correlated with larger GMVs of the left middle temporal pole (r = 0.245, q = 0.03). Conclusions Neuroanatomical alterations in frontostriatal and fronto-cerebellar area, insula, rectus, temporal gyrus volumes, and frontal-temporal thickness may reflect a core pathophysiological mechanism of BDII-D, which are related to inflammation, trauma, and psychiatric symptoms in BDII-D.

We aimed to explore the overlap between hospital-based psychiatric disorders and sheltered homelessness. Methods This population-based cohort study was conducted using the Danish registers e.g., the Danish Homeless Register and the Danish National Patient Register. The study cohort included all individuals aged 15 years or older, living in Denmark at least one day during 2002-2021 (born 1984-2006). First psychiatric diagnosis was used to define psychiatric disorder and first homeless shelter contact to define homelessness. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and cumulative incidences were estimated. Results Among 1 530 325 individuals accounting for 16 787 562 person-years at risk aged 15-38 years, 11 433 (0.8%) had at least one homeless shelter contact. Among 1 406 410 individuals accounting for 14 131 060 person-years at risk, 210 730 had at least one psychiatric disorder. People with any psychiatric disorder had increased risk of sheltered homelessness relative to individuals with no psychiatric disorder [IRR 9.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.8-9.6]. Ten years after first psychiatric disorder, 3.0% (95% CI 2.9-3.1) had at least one homeless shelter contact. Individuals experiencing homelessness had increased risk of any psychiatric disorder compared to individuals with no homeless shelter contact (IRR 7.0, 95% CI 6.7-7.4). Ten years after first homeless shelter contact, 47.1% (45.3-48.0) had received a hospital-based psychiatric diagnosis. Conclusion Strong bidirectional associations between psychiatric disorders and homelessness were identified. Health and social care professionals should be aware of and address these high risks of accumulated psychiatric and social problems.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods Participants came from the population-based Young Finns Study (n = 2377). We calculated a polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRSSCZ) and for major depression (PRSDEP). Diagnoses of psychotic disorders were derived from the hospital care register. Social development from adolescence to middle age was measured by (a) perceived social support from friends, family, and a close other, (b) perceived sociability, and (c) family structure (partnership status, number of children, age of first-time parenthood). Results Among those without manifest psychoses, high PRSSCZ predicted lower experienced support from friends (B = -0.04, p = 0.009-0.035) and family (B = -0.04, p = 0.009-0.035) especially after early adulthood, and also lower perceived sociability (B = -0.05, p = 0.010-0.026). PRSSCZ was not related to family structure. PRSDEP did not predict any domain of social development. Conclusions Individuals at high PRSSCZ (not converted to psychosis) seem to experience a lower preference to be with others over being alone. Individuals with high (v. low) PRSSCZ seem to have a similar family structure in terms of partnership status or number of children but, nevertheless, they experience less support from their family. Among those not converted to psychosis in a typical age period, high PRSSCZ may predict a 'later risk phase' and reduced functional resilience when approaching middle age.

However, as several mental disorders as well as major depressive disorder (MDD) are strongly associated with suicide attempts, these genetic correlations could be mediated by psychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated genetic correlations of suicide attempts with psychiatric and related intermediate phenotypes, with and without adjusting for mental disorders. Methods To investigate the genetic correlations, we utilized large-scale genome-wide association study summary statistics for suicide attempts (with and without adjusting for mental disorders), nine psychiatric disorders, and 15 intermediate phenotypes. Results Without adjusting for mental disorders, suicide attempts had significant positive genetic correlations with risks of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, MDD, anxiety disorders and posttraumatic stress disorder; higher risk tolerance; earlier age at first sexual intercourse, at first birth and at menopause; higher parity; lower childhood IQ, educational attainment and cognitive ability; and lower smoking cessation. After adjusting for mental disorders, suicide attempts had significant positive genetic correlations with the risk of MDD; earlier age at first sexual intercourse, at first birth and at menopause; and lower educational attainment. After adjusting for mental disorders, most of the genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders were decreased, while several genetic correlations with intermediate phenotypes were increased. Conclusions These findings highlight the importance of considering mental disorders in the analysis of genetic correlations related to suicide attempts and suggest that susceptibility to MDD, reproductive behaviors, and lower educational levels share a genetic basis with suicide attempts after adjusting for mental disorders.

Recent basic science models demonstrate that, during fear learning, patterns of activity in large neuronal ensembles for the conditioned stimuli (CS) begin to reinstate neural activity patterns for the unconditioned stimuli (US), suggesting a direct way of quantifying fear memory strength for the CS. Here, we translate this concept to human neuroimaging and test the impact of post-learning dopaminergic neurotransmission on fear memory strength during fear acquisition, extinction, and recall among women with PTSD in a re-analysis of previously reported data. Methods Participants (N = 79) completed a context-dependent fear acquisition and extinction task on day 1 and extinction recall tests 24 h later. We decoded activity patterns in large-scale functional networks for the US, then applied this decoder to activity patterns toward the CS on day 1 and day 2. Results US decoder output for the CS+ increased during acquisition and decreased during extinction in networks traditionally implicated in human fear learning. The strength of US neural reactivation also predicted individuals skin conductance responses. Participants randomized to receive L-DOPA (n = 43) following extinction on day 1 demonstrated less US neural reactivation on day 2 relative to the placebo group (n = 28). Conclusion These results support neural reactivation as a measure of memory strength between competing memories of threat and safety and further demonstrate the role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the consolidation of fear extinction memories. © The Author(s), 2023.

Our aim was to investigate long-term GMV changes over a 2-year period after ECT administration and their associations with clinical outcome. Methods In this nonrandomized longitudinal study, patients with MDD undergoing ECT (n = 17) are assessed three times by structural MRI: Before ECT (t0), after ECT (t1) and 2 years later (t2). A healthy (n = 21) and MDD non-ECT (n = 33) control group are also measured three times within an equivalent time interval. A 3(group) × 3(time) ANOVA on whole-brain level and correlation analyses with clinical outcome variables is performed. Results Analyses yield a significant group × time interaction (pFWE < 0.001) resulting from significant volume increases from t0 to t1 and decreases from t1 to t2 in the ECT group, e.g., in limbic areas. There are no effects of time in both control groups. Volume increases from t0 to t1 correlate with immediate and delayed symptom increase, while volume decreases from t1 to t2 correlate with long-term depressive outcome (all p © 0.049). Conclusions Volume increases induced by ECT appear to be a transient phenomenon as volume strongly decreased 2 years after ECT. Short-term volume increases are associated with less symptom improvement suggesting that the antidepressant effect of ECT is not due to volume changes. Larger volume decreases are associated with poorer long-term outcome highlighting the interplay between disease progression and structural changes. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

However, studies have tended to consider such problems in simple ways using diagnoses, or item summaries. Network theory and methods instead allow for more complex interaction between symptoms. Two key hypotheses predict differences in global network properties for those at risk: altered structure and increased connectivity. Methods The current study evaluated these hypotheses for nine risk factors (e.g. income deprivation and low parent/carer support) individually and cumulatively in a large sample of 12-15 year-olds (N = 34 564). Recursive partitioning and bootstrapped networks were used to evaluate structural and connectivity differences. Results The pattern of network interactions was shown to be significantly different via recursive partitioning for all comparisons across risk-present/absent groups and levels of cumulative risk, except for income deprivation. However, the magnitude of differences appeared small. Most individual risk factors also showed relatively small effects for connectivity. Exceptions were noted for gender and sexual minority risk groups, as well as low parent/carer support, where larger effects were evident. A strong linear trend was observed between increasing cumulative risk exposure and connectivity. Conclusions A robust approach to considering the effect of risk exposure on global network properties was demonstrated. Results are consistent with the ideas that pathological states are associated with higher connectivity, and that the number of risks, regardless of their nature, is important. Gender/sexual minority status and low parent/carer support had the biggest individual impacts on connectivity, suggesting these are particularly important for identification and prevention.

Its clinical importance is increasing as the global population of older adults rises, yet owing to limited research in this population, the neurobiological underpinnings of VLOSP remain insufficiently clarified. Here we address this knowledge gap using novel morphometry techniques to investigate grey matter volume (GMV) differences between VLOSLP and healthy older adults, and their correlations with neuropsychological scores. Methods In this cross-sectional study, we investigated whole-brain GMV differences between 35 individuals with VLOSLP (mean age 76.7, 26 female) and 36 healthy controls (mean age 75.7, 27 female) using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and supplementary source-based morphometry (SBM) on high resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI images. Additionally, we investigated relationships between GMV differences and cognitive function assessed with an extensive neuropsychological battery. Results VBM showed lower GMV in the thalamus, left inferior frontal gyrus and left insula in patients with VLOSLP compared to healthy controls. SBM revealed lower thalamo-temporal GMV in patients with VLOSLP. Processing speed, selective attention, mental flexibility, working memory, verbal memory, semantic fluency and confrontation naming were impaired in patients with VLOSLP. Correlations between thalamic volumes and memory function were significant within the group of individuals with VLOSLP, whereas no significant associations remained in the healthy controls. Conclusions Lower GMV in the thalamus and fronto-temporal regions may be part of the underlying neurobiology of VLOSLP, with lower thalamic GMV contributing to memory impairment in the disorder.

Yet, whether adolescents with depression show aberrant emotional and neural reactivity to parental criticism and praise is understudied. Methods Adolescents with depression (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 59) received feedback supposedly provided by their mother or father in the form of negative ('untrustworthy'), neutral ('chaotic'), and positive ('respectful') personality evaluations while in an MRI-scanner. After each feedback word, adolescents reported their mood. Beforehand, adolescents had rated whether these personality evaluations matched their self-views. Results In both groups, mood decreased after criticism and increased after praise. Adolescents with depression reported blunted mood responses after praise, whereas there were no mood differences after criticism. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that adolescents with depression (v. healthy controls) exhibited increased activity in response to criticism in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, temporal pole, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Praise consistent with adolescents' self-views improved mood independent of depression status, while criticism matching self-views resulted in smaller mood increases in adolescents with depression (v. healthy controls). Exploratory analyses indicated that adolescents with depression recalled criticism (v. praise) more. Conclusions Adolescents with depression might be especially attentive to parental criticism, as indexed by increased sgACC and hippocampus activity, and memorize this criticism more. Together with lower positive impact of praise, these findings suggest that cognitive biases in adolescent depression may affect how parental feedback is processed, and may be fed into their self-views.

We compared two competing hypotheses of the dynamic effects of risk. The risk escalation hypothesis posits that worsening of risk predicts DD onset beyond risk level. The chronic risk hypothesis posits that persistently elevated risk level, rather than risk change, predicts DD onset. Methods Our sample included 393 girls (baseline age 13.5-15.5 years) from the adolescent development of emotions and personality traits project. Participants underwent five diagnostic interviews and assessments of risk markers for DD at 9-month intervals and were re-interviewed at a 6-year follow-up. We focused on 17 well-established risk markers. For each risk marker, we examined the prospective effects of risk level and change on first DD onset at wave six, estimated by growth curve modeling using data from the first five waves. Results For 13 of the 17 depression risk markers, elevated levels of risk during adolescence, but not change in risk, predicted first DD onset during transition to adulthood, supporting the chronic risk hypothesis. Minimal evidence was found for the risk escalation hypothesis. Conclusions Participants who had a first DD onset during transition to adulthood have exhibited elevated levels of risk throughout adolescence. Researchers and practitioners should administer multiple assessments and focus on persistently elevated levels of risk to identify individuals who are most likely to develop DD and to provide targeted DD prevention.

However, it is unclear if the N100 is a psychosis endophenotype that is also altered in the relatives of patients. Methods We conducted a family study using the auditory oddball paradigm to compare the N100 amplitude and latency across 243 patients with psychosis, 86 unaffected relatives, and 194 controls. We then conducted a systematic review and a random-effects meta-analysis pooling our results and 14 previously published family studies. We compared data from a total of 999 patients, 1192 relatives, and 1253 controls in order to investigate the evidence and degree of N100 differences. Results In our family study, patients showed reduced N100 amplitudes and prolonged N100 latencies compared to controls, but no significant differences were found between unaffected relatives and controls. The meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction of the N100 amplitude and delay of the N100 latency in both patients with psychosis (standardized mean difference [s.m.d.] = -0.48 for N100 amplitude and s.m.d. = 0.43 for N100 latency) and their relatives (s.m.d. = - 0.19 for N100 amplitude and s.m.d. = 0.33 for N100 latency). However, only the N100 latency changes in relatives remained significant when excluding studies with affected relatives. Conclusions N100 changes, especially prolonged N100 latencies, are present in both patients with psychosis and their relatives, making the N100 a promising endophenotype for psychosis. Such changes in the N100 may reflect changes in early auditory processing underlying the etiology of psychosis.  Copyright © 2023 The Author(s).

Whether neurofeedback (NF) directly targeting them is suited for treatment remains unclear. This study sought to determine feasibility and estimate effects of individualized, functional near-infrared spectroscopy-based real-time NF (rtfNIRS-NF) and high-beta electroencephalography-based NF (EEG-NF), assuming superiority over waitlist (WL). Methods Single-center, assessor-blinded feasibility study with randomization to rtfNIRS-NF, EEG-NF, or WL and assessments at baseline (t0), postassessment (t1), and 6-month follow-up (t2). NF comprised 12 60-min food-specific rtfNIRS-NF or EEG-NF sessions over 8 weeks. Primary outcome was the binge-eating frequency at t1 assessed interview-based. Secondary outcomes included feasibility, eating disorder symptoms, mental and physical health, weight management-related behavior, executive functions, and brain activity at t1 and t2. Results In 72 patients (intent-to-treat), the results showed feasibility of NF regarding recruitment, attrition, adherence, compliance, acceptance, and assessment completion. Binge eating improved at t1 by -8.0 episodes, without superiority of NF v. WL (-0.8 episodes, 95% CI -2.4 to 4.0), but with improved estimates in NF at t2 relative to t1. NF was better than WL for food craving, anxiety symptoms, and body mass index, but overall effects were mostly small. Brain activity changes were near zero. Conclusions The results show feasibility of food-specific rtfNIRS-NF and EEG-NF in BED, and no posttreatment differences v. WL, but possible continued improvement of binge eating. Confirmatory and mechanistic evidence is warranted in a double-blind randomized design with long-term follow-up, considering dose-response relationships and modes of delivery.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods Using a longitudinal observational research design with samples representative of the US and UK adult population with regard to sex, age, and ethnicity (N = 9732), we investigated potential associations between self-reported psychedelic use and meditation practice. Results The follow-up survey was completed by 7667 respondents (79% retention rate), with 100 respondents reporting psychedelic use during the 2-month study period (1.3% of follow-up respondents). In covariate-adjusted regression models, psychedelic use during the study period was associated with greater increases in the number of days of mindfulness meditation practice in the past week (B = 0.40, p = 0.004). Among those who reported psychedelic use during the study period, covariate-adjusted regression models revealed that the subjective experience of insight during respondents' most intense psychedelic experience in that period was also associated with greater increases in the number of days of mindfulness and loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice in the past week (B = 0.42, p = 0.021; B = 0.38, p = 0.017). Notably, more days of loving-kindness or compassion meditation practice in the past week at baseline was associated with less severe subjective feelings of death or dying during respondents' most intense psychedelic experience in the study period (B = -0.29, p = 0.037).

Research has generated preliminary evidence for a low-calorie diet (LCD) in reducing depressive symptoms. The aim of the current systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine this evidence to determine whether a LCD reduces depressive symptoms in people with overweight or obesity. Methods Eligible studies were identified through PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and PsycINFO until August 2023. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were derived using random-effects meta-analyses for (1) pre-post LCD comparisons of depression outcomes, and (2) LCD v. no-diet-control group comparisons of depression outcomes. Results A total of 25 studies were included in the pre-post meta-analysis, finding that depression scores were significantly lower following a LCD (SMD = -0.47), which was not significantly moderated by the addition of exercise or behavioral therapy as a non-diet adjunct. Meta-regressions indicated that a higher baseline BMI and greater weight reduction were associated with a greater reduction in depression scores. The intervention-control meta-analysis (n = 4) found that overweight or obese participants adhering to a LCD showed a nominally lower depression score compared with those given no intervention (SMD = -0.29). Conclusions There is evidence that LCDs may reduce depressive symptoms in people with overweight or obesity in the short term. Future well-controlled intervention studies, including a non-active control group, and longer-term follow-ups, are warranted in order to make more definitive conclusions.  © The Author(s), 2023.

While the distress related to gender nonconformity may be socially produced rather than attributed to individual-level factors, further research is needed to better understand the role of psychosocial factors in this context. Method We analyzed data from the Tokyo Teen Cohort, obtained through random sampling of adolescents born between 2002 and 2004. We used inverse probability weighting to examine the association of gender nonconformity at ages 12 and 14 as a time-varying variable with subsequent mental health at age 16, while accounting for time-fixed and time-varying confounders. Furthermore, we used a weighting approach to investigate the mediating role of modifiable psychosocial factors in this association, addressing exposure-mediator and mediator-mediator interactions. Results A total of 3171 participants were analyzed. Persistent gender nonconforming behavior at ages 12 and 14 was associated with subsequent depression (β = 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 3.19) and psychotic experiences (β = 0.33, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52) at age 16. The results remained robust in sensitivity analyses. Approximately 30% of the association between gender nonconformity and depression was consistently mediated by a set of psychosocial factors, namely loneliness, bullying victimization, and relationships with mother, father, and friends. Conclusions Persistent gender nonconformity during adolescence is associated with subsequent mental health. Psychosocial factors play a vital mediating role in this association, highlighting the essential need for social intervention and change to reduce stigmatization and ameliorate mental health challenges.

As first step toward a more refined analysis of the impact of CM, our objective is to revisit the relation of abuse and neglect, major subtypes of CM, with symptoms across disorders. Methods Three longitudinal studies of major depressive disorder (MDD, N = 1240), bipolar disorder (BD, N = 1339), and schizophrenia (SCZ, N = 577), each including controls (N = 881), were analyzed. Multivariate regression models were used to examine the relation between exposure to abuse, neglect, or their combination to the odds for MDD, BD, SCZ, and symptoms across disorders. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to probe causality, using genetic instruments of abuse and neglect derived from UK Biobank data (N = 143 473). Results Abuse was the stronger risk factor for SCZ (OR 3.51, 95% CI 2.17-5.67) and neglect for BD (OR 2.69, 95% CI 2.09-3.46). Combined CM was related to increased risk exceeding additive effects of abuse and neglect for MDD (RERI = 1.4) and BD (RERI = 1.1). Across disorders, abuse was associated with hallucinations (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.55-3.01) and suicide attempts (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.55-3.01) whereas neglect was associated with agitation (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51) and reduced need for sleep (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.08-2.48). MR analyses were consistent with a bidirectional causal effect of abuse with SCZ (IVWforward = 0.13, 95% CI 0.01-0.24). Conclusions Childhood abuse and neglect are associated with different risks to psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Unraveling the origin of these differences may advance understanding of disease etiology and ultimately facilitate development of improved personalized treatment strategies.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Treating MDD effectively is considered a key suicide prevention intervention. Yet many patients with MDD do not respond to their initial medication and require a 'next-step'. The relationship between next-step treatments and suicidal thoughts and behaviors is uncharted. Method The VA Augmentation and Switching Treatments for Depression trial randomized 1522 participants to one of three next-step treatments: Switching to Bupropion, combining with Bupropion, and augmenting with Aripiprazole. In this secondary analysis, features associated with lifetime suicidal ideation (SI) and attempts (SA) at baseline and current SI during treatment were explored. Results Compared to those with SI only, those with lifetime SI + SA were more likely to be female, divorced, or separated, unemployed; and to have experienced more childhood adversity. They had a more severe depressive episode and were more likely to respond to 'next-step' treatment. The prevalence of SI decreased from 46.5% (694/1492) at baseline to 21.1% (315/1492) at end-of-treatment. SI during treatment was associated with baseline SI; low positive mental health, more anxiety, greater severity and longer duration of current MDD episode; being male and White; and treatment with S-BUP or C-BUP as compared to A-ARI. Conclusion SI declines for most patients during next-step medication treatments. But about 1 in 5 experienced emergent or worsening SI during treatment, so vigilance for suicide risk through the entire 12-week acute treatment period is necessary. Treatment selection may affect the risk of SI. © Department of Veteran Affairs, 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Methods Data were obtained from the baseline session of the ongoing longitudinal Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We identified 1706 preterm children and 1865 matched individuals as Control group and compared brain structure (MRI data), cognitive function and mental health symptoms. Results Results showed that preterm children had higher psychopathological risk and lower cognitive function scores compared to controls. Structural MRI analysis indicated that preterm children had higher cortical thickness in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal and occipital gyrus; smaller volumes in the temporal and parietal gyrus, cerebellum, insula and thalamus; and smaller fiber tract volumes in the fornix and parahippocampal-cingulum bundle. Partial correlation analyses showed that gestational age and birth weight were associated with ADHD symptoms, picvocab, flanker, reading, fluid cognition composite, crystallized cognition composite and total cognition composite scores, and measures of brain structure in regions involved with emotional regulation, attention and cognition. Conclusions These findings suggest a complex interplay between psychopathological risk and cognitive deficits in preterm children that is associated with changes in regional brain volumes, cortical thickness, and structural connectivity among cortical and limbic brain regions critical for cognition and emotional well-being.

Ventricular enlargement has been identified in schizophrenia since the initial development of neuroimaging techniques. Obstetric abnormalities have been associated with an increased risk of developing psychosis but also with cognitive impairment and brain structure abnormalities. Difficulties during delivery are associated with a higher risk of birth asphyxia leading to brain structural abnormalities, such as ventriculomegaly, which has been related to cognitive disturbances. Methods We examined differences in ventricular size between 142 FEP patients and 123 healthy control participants using magnetic resonance imaging. Obstetric complications were evaluated using the Lewis-Murray scale. We examined the impact of obstetric difficulties during delivery on ventricle size as well as the possible relationship between ventricle size and cognitive impairment in both groups. Results FEP patients displayed significantly larger third ventricle size compared with healthy controls. Third ventricle enlargement was associated with diagnosis (higher volume in patients), with difficulties during delivery (higher volume in subjects with difficulties), and was highest in patients with difficulties during delivery. Verbal memory was significantly associated with third ventricle to brain ratio. Conclusions Our results suggest that difficulties during delivery might be significant contributors to the ventricular enlargement historically described in schizophrenia. Thus, obstetric complications may contribute to the development of psychosis through changes in brain architecture. © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Cortical gyrification, a key morphological feature of human cerebral cortex, has been considered associated with developmental connectivity in early life. Monitoring cortical gyrification alterations may provide new insights into the developmental pathogenesis of OCD. Methods Sixty-two medication-naive patients with OCD and 59 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. Local gyrification index (LGI) was extracted from T1-weighted MRI data to identify the gyrification changes in OCD. Total distortion (splay, bend, or twist of fibers) was calculated using diffusion-weighted MRI data to examine the changes in white matter microstructure in patients with OCD. Results Compared with HCs, patients with OCD showed significantly increased LGI in bilateral medial frontal gyrus and the right precuneus, where the mean LGI was positively correlated with anxiety score. Patients with OCD also showed significantly decreased total distortion in the body, genu, and splenium of the corpus callosum (CC), where the average distortion was negatively correlated with anxiety scores. Intriguingly, the mean LGI of the affected cortical regions was significantly correlated with the mean distortion of the affected white matter tracts in patients with OCD. Conclusions We demonstrated associations among increased LGI, aberrant white matter geometry, and higher anxiety in patients with OCD. Our findings indicate that developmental dysconnectivity-driven alterations in cortical folding are one of the neural substrates underlying the clinical manifestations of OCD.

Traditionally, BD II has been conceptualized as a less severe presentation of BD I, however, extant literature to investigate this claim has been mixed. Methods We apply genomic structural equation modeling (Genomic SEM) to investigate divergent genetic pathways across BD's two major subtypes using the most recent GWAS summary statistics from the PGC. We begin by identifying divergences in genetic correlations across 98 external traits using a Bonferroni-corrected threshold. We also use a theoretically informed follow-up model to examine the extent to which the genetic variance in each subtype is explained by schizophrenia and major depression. Lastly, transcriptome-wide SEM (T-SEM) was used to identify neuronal gene expression patterns associated with BD subtypes. Results BD II was characterized by significantly larger genetic overlap across non-psychiatric medical and internalizing traits (e.g. heart disease, neuroticism, insomnia), while stronger associations for BD I were absent. Consistent with these findings, follow-up modeling revealed a substantial major depression component for BD II. T-SEM results revealed 35 unique genes associated with shared risk across BD subtypes. Conclusions Divergent patterns of genetic relationships across external traits provide support for the distinction of the bipolar subtypes. However, our results also challenge the illness severity conceptualization of BD given stronger genetic overlap across BD II and a range of clinically relevant traits and disorders. © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods Electrophysiological correlates of suicide were evaluated using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 75 adults with differing levels of suicide risk. During MEG scanning, participants completed a modified Life-Death Implicit Association Task. MEG data were source-localized in the gamma (30-58 Hz) frequency, a proxy measure of excitation-inhibition balance. Dynamic causal modeling was used to evaluate differences in connectivity estimates between risk groups. A proof-of-concept, open-label, pilot study of five high risk participants examined changes in gamma power after administration of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), an NMDAR antagonist with rapid anti-suicide ideation effects. Results Implicit self-associations with death were stronger in the highest suicide risk group relative to all other groups, which did not differ from each other. Higher gamma power for self-death compared to self-life associations was found in the orbitofrontal cortex for the highest risk group and the insula and posterior cingulate cortex for the lowest risk group. Connectivity estimates between these regions differentiated the highest risk group from the full sample. Implicit associations with death were not affected by ketamine, but enhanced gamma power was found for self-death associations in the left insula post-ketamine compared to baseline. Conclusions Differential implicit cognitive processing of life and death appears to be linked to suicide risk, highlighting the need for objective measures of suicidal states. Pharmacotherapies that modulate gamma activity, particularly in the insula, may help mitigate risk. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02543983, NCT00397111. © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods 108 092 presentations to hospitals (by 57 306 individuals) after self-harm in the Multicenter Study of Self-harm spanning 17 years. Area-level SED was based on the English Index of Multiple Deprivation. Information about indicators of clinical care was obtained from each hospital's self-harm monitoring systems. We assessed the associations of SED with indicators of care using mixed effect models. Results Controlling for confounders, psychosocial assessment and admission to a general medical ward were less likely for presentations by patients living in more deprived areas relative to presentations by patients from the least deprived areas. Referral for outpatient mental health care was less likely for presentations by patients from the two most deprived localities (most deprived: adjusted odd ratio [aOR] 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.83, p < 0.0001; 2nd most deprived: aOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.74-0.87, p < 0.0001). Referral to substance use services and 'other' services increased with increased SED. Overall, referral for aftercare was less likely following presentations by patients living in the two most deprived areas (most deprived: aOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.92, p < 0.0001; 2nd most deprived: aOR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79-0.94, p = 0.001). Conclusions SED is associated with differential care for patients who self-harm in England. Inequalities in care may exacerbate the risk of adverse outcomes in this disadvantaged population.

Most studies rely on body mass index (BMI) as the sole weight indicator, with few examining the aetiology of the association between weight indicators and depressive symptoms. Methods We analysed data from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) and UK Adult Twin Registry (TwinsUK) (7658 and 2775 twin pairs, respectively). A phenotypic cross-lagged panel model assessed the directionality between BMI and depressive symptoms at ages 12, 16, and 21 years in TEDS. Bivariate correlations tested the phenotypic association between a range of weight indicators and depressive symptoms in TwinsUK. In both samples, structural equation modelling of twin data investigated genetic and environmental influences between weight indicators and depression. Sensitivity analyses included two-wave phenotypic cross-lagged panel models and the exclusion of those with a BMI <18.5. Results Within TEDS, the relationship between BMI and depression was bidirectional between ages 12 and 16 with a stronger influence of earlier BMI on later depression. The associations were unidirectional thereafter with depression at 16 influencing BMI at 21. Small genetic correlations were found between BMI and depression at ages 16 and 21, but not at 12. Within TwinsUK, depression was weakly correlated with weight indicators; therefore, it was not possible to generate precise estimates of genetic or environmental correlations. Conclusions The directionality of the relationship between BMI and depression appears to be developmentally sensitive. Further research with larger genetically informative samples is needed to estimate the aetiological influence on these associations.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods 103 women (and their offspring) were included, 43 at-risk-of-PP because of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, schizoaffective disorder or previous PP, and 60 with no current/previous mental illness or family history of PP. Of the at-risk women, 18 developed a psychiatric relapse within 4 weeks after delivery (AR-unwell), while 25 remained symptom-free (AR-well). Mother-infant interaction was assessed using the CARE-Index at 8 weeks' and 12 months' postpartum and infant development using the Bayley-III at 12 months' postpartum. Results Women at-risk-of-PP as a group, regardless of whether they developed a psychiatric relapse within 4 weeks after delivery, had less synchronous mother-infant interactions and had infants with less optimal cognitive, language, motor and socio-emotional development than healthy controls. In particular, boys of at-risk women had the lowest scores in cognitive, language and motor development and in mother-infant interaction, while girls of the at-risk women had the lowest scores in socio-emotional development. The synchrony in the dyad predicted infant cognitive and language development. There was no evidence for a difference in mother-infant interaction nor in infant development between the AR-unwell and AR-well groups. Conclusions These results suggest that, while there is a lack of evidence that an early postpartum relapse in women at-risk-of-PP could represent a risk for the infant per se, maternal risk for PP may be associated with less optimal mother-infant interaction and infant development.

We investigated neuroimaging phenotypes that facilitate the reciprocity between stress and depressive symptoms. Methods In total, 22 195 participants (52.0% females) from the population-based UK Biobank study completed two visits (initial visit: 2006-2010, age = 55.0 ± 7.5 [40-70] years; second visit: 2014-2019; age = 62.7 ± 7.5 [44-80] years). Structural equation modeling was used to examine the longitudinal relationship between self-report stressful life events (SLEs) and depressive symptoms. Cross-sectional data were used to examine the overlap between neuroimaging correlates of SLEs and depressive symptoms on the second visit among 138 multimodal imaging phenotypes. Results Longitudinal data were consistent with significant bidirectional causal relationship between SLEs and depressive symptoms. In cross-sectional analyses, SLEs were significantly associated with lower bilateral nucleus accumbal volume and lower fractional anisotropy of the forceps major. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with extensive white matter hyperintensities, thinner cortex, lower subcortical volume, and white matter microstructural deficits, mainly in corticostriatal-limbic structures. Lower bilateral nucleus accumbal volume were the only imaging phenotypes with overlapping effects of depressive symptoms and SLEs (B = -0.032 to -0.023, p = 0.006-0.034). Depressive symptoms and SLEs significantly partially mediated the effects of each other on left and right nucleus accumbens volume (proportion of effects mediated = 12.7-14.3%, p < 0.001-p = 0.008). For the left nucleus accumbens, post-hoc seed-based analysis showed lower resting-state functional connectivity with the left orbitofrontal cortex (cluster size = 83 voxels, p = 5.4 × 10-5) in participants with high v. no SLEs. Conclusions The nucleus accumbens may play a key role in the reciprocity between stress and depressive symptoms. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Successful regulation of these affective experiences is important for good mental health and has been proposed to depend on affective control. The present study examined whether improving affective control through a computerised affective control training app (AffeCT) would benefit adolescent mental health. Methods One-hundred and ninety-nine participants (11-19 years) were assigned to complete 2 weeks of AffeCT or placebo training on an app. Affective control (i.e. affective inhibition, affective updating and affective shifting), mental health and emotion regulation were assessed at pre- and post-training. Mental health and emotion regulation were assessed again one month and one year later. Results Compared with the placebo group, the AffeCT group showed significantly greater improvements in affective control on the trained measure. AffeCT did not, relative to placebo, lead to better performance on untrained measures of affective control. Pre- to post-training change in affective control covaried with pre- to post-training change in mental health problems in the AffeCT but not the placebo group. These mental health benefits of AffeCT were only observed immediately following training and did not extend to 1 month or year post-training. Conclusion In conclusion, the study provides preliminary evidence that AffeCT may confer short-term preventative benefits for adolescent mental health.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

However, it is unclear whether these neural functions are similarly impaired in other disorders with psychotic symptomatology or individuals with genetic liability for psychosis. If abnormalities in reward sensitive brain areas are shared across individuals with psychotic psychopathology and people with heightened genetic liability for psychosis, there may be a common neural basis for symptoms of diminished pleasure and motivation. Methods We compared performance and neural activity in 123 people with a history of psychosis (PwP), 81 of their first-degree biological relatives, and 49 controls during a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task during fMRI. Results PwP exhibited hypoactivation of the striatum and anterior insula (AI) during cueing of potential future rewards with each diagnostic group showing hypoactivations during reward anticipation compared to controls. Despite normative task performance, relatives demonstrated caudate activation intermediate between controls and PwP, nucleus accumbens activation more similar to PwP than controls, but putamen activation on par with controls. Across diagnostic groups of PwP there was less functional connectivity between bilateral caudate and several regions of the salience network (medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, AI) during reward anticipation. Conclusions Findings implicate less activation and connectivity in reward processing brain regions across a spectrum of disorders involving psychotic psychopathology. Specifically, aberrations in striatal and insular activity during reward anticipation seen in schizophrenia are partially shared with other forms of psychotic psychopathology and associated with genetic liability for psychosis. © U.S. Federal Government and University of Minnesota, 2024.

There are currently no support or effective intervention therapeutics for individuals with an ED in their everyday life. The aim of this study is to build idiographic machine learning (ML) models to evaluate the performance of physiological recordings to detect individual ED behaviors in naturalistic settings. Methods From an ongoing study (Final N = 120), we piloted the ability for ML to detect an individual's ED behavioral episodes (e.g. purging) from physiological data in six individuals diagnosed with an ED, all of whom endorsed purging. Participants wore an ambulatory monitor for 30 days and tapped a button to denote ED behavioral episodes. We built idiographic (N = 1) logistic regression classifiers (LRC) ML trained models to identify onset of episodes (~600 windows) v. baseline (~571 windows) physiology (Heart Rate, Electrodermal Activity, and Temperature). Results Using physiological data, ML LRC accurately classified on average 91% of cases, with 92% specificity and 90% sensitivity. Conclusions This evidence suggests the ability to build idiographic ML models that detect ED behaviors from physiological indices within everyday life with a high level of accuracy. The novel use of ML with wearable sensors to detect physiological patterns of ED behavior pre-onset can lead to just-in-time clinical interventions to disrupt problematic behaviors and promote ED recovery. © The Author(s), 2023.

However, previous studies have disagreed about whether this behavior is produced by alterations in the rate of learning or sensitivity to experienced outcomes. This previous work has generally assessed learning in response to binary outcomes of one valence, rather than to both rewarding and punishing continuous outcomes. Methods A novel drifting reward and punishment magnitude reinforcement-learning task was administered to patients with current (n = 40) and remitted depression (n = 39), and healthy volunteers (n = 40) to capture potential differences in learning behavior. Standard questionnaires were administered to measure self-reported depressive symptom severity, trait and state anxiety and level of anhedonic symptoms. Results Our findings demonstrate that patients with current depression adjust their learning behaviors to a lesser degree in response to trial-by-trial variations in reward and loss magnitudes than the other groups. Computational modeling revealed that this behavioral signature of current depressive state is better accounted for by reduced reward and punishment sensitivity (all p < 0.031), rather than a change in learning rate (p = 0.708). However, between-group differences were not related to self-reported symptom severity or comorbid anxiety disorders in the current depression group. Conclusion These findings suggest that current depression is associated with reduced outcome sensitivity rather than altered learning rate. Previous findings reported in this domain mainly from binary learning tasks seem to generalize to learning from continuous outcomes.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 162 patients with BD: 33 (hypo)manic, 64 euthymic, and 65 depressive, and 80 healthy controls (HCs). The differences of large-scale brain network functional connectivity (FC) between the four groups were compared and correlated with clinical characteristics. To validate the generalizability of our findings, we recruited a small longitudinal independent sample of BD patients (n = 11). In addition, we examined topological nodal properties across four groups as exploratory analysis. Results A specific strengthened pattern of network FC, predominantly involving the default mode network (DMN), was observed in (hypo)manic patients when compared with HCs and bipolar patients in other mood states. Longitudinal observation revealed an increase in several network FCs in patients during (hypo)manic episode. Both samples evidenced an increase in the FC between the DMN and ventral attention network, and between the DMN and limbic network (LN) related to (hypo)mania. The altered network connections were correlated with mania severity and positive affect. Bipolar depressive patients exhibited decreased FC within the LN compared with HCs. The exploratory analysis also revealed an increase in degree in (hypo)manic patients. Conclusions Our findings identify a distributed pattern of large-scale network disturbances in the unique context of (hypo)mania and thus provide new evidence for our understanding of the neural mechanism of BD.  © Peking University Sixth Hospital, Peking University Institute of Mental Health and the Author(s), 2023.

Maternal anxiety, depression, and stress during and after pregnancy are negatively associated with child cognitive development. However, the contribution of positive maternal experiences, such as social support, to child cognitive development has received less attention. Furthermore, how maternal experience of social support during specific developmental periods impacts child cognitive development is largely unknown. Methods. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; n = 5784) and the Prediction and Prevention of Preeclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction study (PREDO; n = 420), we investigated the associations between maternal perceived social support during and after pregnancy and child's general cognitive ability at 8 years of age, assessed with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC). Bayesian relevant life course modeling was used to investigate timing effects of maternal social support on child cognitive ability. Results. In both cohorts, higher maternal perceived social support during pregnancy was associated with higher performance on the WISC, independent of sociodemographic factors and concurrent maternal symptoms of depression and anxiety. In ALSPAC, pregnancy emerged as a sensitive period for the effects of perceived social support on child cognitive ability, with a stronger effect of social support during pregnancy than after pregnancy on child cognitive ability. Conclusions. Our findings, supported from two prospective longitudinal cohorts, suggest a distinct role of maternal perceived social support during pregnancy for cognitive development in children. Our study suggests that interventions aimed at increasing maternal social support during pregnancy may be an important strategy for promoting maternal and child well-being.

This study investigated the potential role of oxytocin and oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) in mediating the effects of childhood trauma on social functioning in schizophrenia. Methods The study consisted of 382 patients with schizophrenia and 178 healthy controls who were assessed using the Taiwanese version of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ-SF), the Social Functioning Scale (SFS), and plasma oxytocin levels. DNA was extracted to genotype the OXTR and ten single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs2254298, rs237885, rs237887, rs237899, rs53576, rs9840864, rs13316193, rs7632287, rs1042778, and rs237895) were selected. Results Patients with schizophrenia showed higher CTQ-SF scores (t = 12.549, p < 0.001), lower SFS scores (t = -46.951, p < 0.001), and lower plasma oxytocin levels (t = -5.448, p < 0.001) compared to healthy controls. The study also found significant differences in OXTR SNPs between both groups, with risk alleles being more prevalent in patients with schizophrenia (t = 2.734, p = 0.006). Results indicated a significant moderated mediation effect, with oxytocin and the OXTR SNPs partially mediating the relationship between childhood trauma exposure and social functioning in patients with schizophrenia (index of mediation = 0.038, 95% CI [0.033-0.044]). Conclusions The findings suggest that oxytocin and its receptor gene may be promising targets for interventions aimed at improving social functioning in patients with a history of childhood trauma and schizophrenia. However, further research is needed to fully understand these effects and the potential of oxytocin-based interventions in this population. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVH) are one of the most common and distressing psychotic symptoms, whose etiology remains largely unknown. Two prominent accounts portray AVH either as a deficit in auditory-verbal self-monitoring, or as a result of overly strong perceptual priors. Methods In order to test both theoretical models and evaluate their potential integration, we developed a robotic procedure able to induce self-monitoring perturbations (consisting of sensorimotor conflicts between poking movements and corresponding tactile feedback) and a perceptual prior associated with otherness sensations (i.e. feeling the presence of a non-existing another person). Results Here, in two independent studies, we show that this robotic procedure led to AVH-like phenomena in healthy individuals, quantified as an increase in false alarm rate in a voice detection task. Robotically-induced AVH-like sensations were further associated with delusional ideation and to both AVH accounts. Specifically, a condition with stronger sensorimotor conflicts induced more AVH-like sensations (self-monitoring), while, in the otherness-related experimental condition, there were more AVH-like sensations when participants were detecting other-voice stimuli, compared to detecting self-voice stimuli (strong-priors). Conclusions By demonstrating an experimental procedure able to induce AVH-like sensations in non-hallucinating individuals, we shed new light on AVH phenomenology, thereby integrating self-monitoring and strong-priors accounts.

Methods We included individuals aged 19-62 with GD between 2005 and 2018 (n = 2830; 71.1% men, mean age: 35.1) and a matched comparison cohort (n = 28 300). Work disability was operationalized as the aggregated net days of sickness absence and disability pension. Generalized estimating equation models were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the risk of long-term work disability (>90 days of work disability/year). Secondly, we conducted Group-based Trajectory Models on days of work disability. Results Individuals with GD showed a four-year increased risk of long-term work disability compared to the matched cohort, peaking at the time of diagnosis (AOR = 1.89; CI 1.67-2.13). Four trajectory groups of work disability days were identified: constant low (60.3%, 5.6-11.2 days), low and increasing (11.4%, 11.8-152.5 days), medium-high and decreasing (11.1%, 65.1-110 days), and constant high (17.1%, 264-331 days). Individuals who were females, older, with prior psychiatric diagnosis, and had been dispensed a psychotropic medication, particularly antidepressants, were more likely to be assigned to groups other than the constant low. Conclusion Individuals with GD have an increased risk of work disability which may add financial and social pressure and is an additional incentive for earlier detection and prevention of GD. © The Author(s), 2023.

This study, therefore, explores the cognitive discrepancy, and its association with the trajectory of symptoms and functioning over a 6-month period. Methods We used data from the Prospective Research Observation to Assess Cognition in Treated patients with MDD (PROACT) study, from which 598 patients were included. Cognitive discrepancy scores were computed using a novel methodology, with positive values indicating more subjective than objective deficit (i.e. 'underestimation') and negative values indicating more objective than subjective difficulties (i.e. 'overestimation'). Linear growth curve models were employed to examine the association of the cognitive discrepancy with the trajectory of depressive symptoms, psychosocial function, and quality of life. Results About 68% of patients displayed disproportionately more objective than subjective cognitive deficit at baseline, and the mean cognitive discrepancy score was -1.4 (2.7). Overestimation was associated with a faster decrease of HDRS-17 (β = -0.46, p = 0.002) and a faster decrease of psychosocial function in social life (β = -0.13, p = 0.013) and family life (β = -0.12, p = 0.026), and a greater improvement of EQ-5D utility score (β = 0.01, p < 0.001). Conclusion We found a lower sensitivity of cognitive deficit at baseline and its decrease was associated with better health outcomes. Our findings have clinical implications of the necessity to assess both subjective and objective cognition for identification and categorization and to incorporate cognitive and psychological therapies for optimized treatment outcomes.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Machine learning techniques may aid in early recognition and reduce the disease burden. As both individuals at risk and those with a manifest disease display structural brain markers, structural magnetic resonance imaging may provide relevant classification features. Methods Following a pre-registered protocol, we trained linear support vector machine (SVM) to classify individuals according to their estimated risk for bipolar disorder using regional cortical thickness of help-seeking individuals from seven study sites (N = 276). We estimated the risk using three state-of-the-art assessment instruments (BPSS-P, BARS, EPIbipolar). Results For BPSS-P, SVM achieved a fair performance of Cohen's κ of 0.235 (95% CI 0.11-0.361) and a balanced accuracy of 63.1% (95% CI 55.9-70.3) in the 10-fold cross-validation. In the leave-one-site-out cross-validation, the model performed with a Cohen's κ of 0.128 (95% CI -0.069 to 0.325) and a balanced accuracy of 56.2% (95% CI 44.6-67.8). BARS and EPIbipolar could not be predicted. In post hoc analyses, regional surface area, subcortical volumes as well as hyperparameter optimization did not improve the performance. Conclusions Individuals at risk for bipolar disorder, as assessed by BPSS-P, display brain structural alterations that can be detected using machine learning. The achieved performance is comparable to previous studies which attempted to classify patients with manifest disease and healthy controls. Unlike previous studies of bipolar risk, our multicenter design permitted a leave-one-site-out cross-validation. Whole-brain cortical thickness seems to be superior to other structural brain features. © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Methods Using a 2 × 2 factorial design, this multicentre study randomized 200 adults with MDD to once or twice weekly sessions of CBT or IPT over 16-24 weeks, up to a maximum of 20 sessions. Main outcome measures were depression severity, measured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Results Compared with patients who received once weekly sessions, patients who received twice weekly sessions showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms up through month 9, but this effect was no longer apparent at month 24. Patients who received CBT showed a significantly larger decrease in depressive symptoms up to month 24 compared to patients who received IPT, but the between-group effect size at month 24 was small. No differential effects between session frequencies or treatment modalities were found in response or relapse rates. Conclusions Although a higher session frequency leads to better outcomes in the acute phase of treatment, the difference in depression severity dissipated over time and there was no significant difference in relapse.

Here, we used cPAS targeting the fronto-striatal inhibitory network to modulate performance on a response inhibition measure in chronic alcohol use. Methods Fifty-five participants (20 patients with a formal alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnosis (26-74 years, 6[30%] females) and 20 matched healthy controls (HCs) (27-73 years, 6[30%] females) within a larger sample of 35 HCs (23-84 years, 11[31.4%] females) underwent two randomized sessions of cPAS 1-week apart: right inferior frontal cortex stimulation preceding right presupplementary motor area stimulation by either 4 ms (excitation condition) or 100 ms (control condition), and were subsequently administered the Stop Signal Task (SST) in both sessions. Results HCs showed decreased stop signal reaction time in the excitation condition (t(19) = -3.01, p = 0.007, [CIs]:-35.6 to -6.42); this facilitatory effect was not observed for AUD (F(1,31) = 9.57, p = 0.004, CIs: -68.64 to -14.11). Individually, rates of SST improvement were substantially higher for healthy (72%) relative to AUD (13.6%) groups (OR: 2.33, p = 0.006, CIs:-3.34 to -0.55). Conclusion In line with previous findings, cPAS improved response inhibition in healthy adults by strengthening the fronto-striatal network through putative long-term potentiation-like plasticity mechanisms. Furthermore, we identified a possible marker of impaired cortical excitability, and, thus, diminished capacity for cPAS-induced neuroplasticity in AUD with direct implications to a disorder-relevant cognitive process.

Methods We employed a large children-of-twins-and-siblings sample (N = 22 276 parents and 11 566 8-year-old children) of the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study. This enabled us to disentangle intergenerational influences via parental genes and parental behaviors (i.e. genetic and environmental transmission, respectively). Fathers reported on their own symptoms and mothers on their own and their child's symptoms. Results Child ADHD behaviors correlated with their mother's (0.24) and father's (0.10) ADHD behaviors. These correlations were largely due to additive genetic transmission. Variation in children's ADHD behaviors was explained by genetic factors active in both generations (11%) and genetic factors specific to the children (46%), giving a total heritability of 57%. There were small effects of parental ADHD behaviors (2% environmental transmission) and gene-environment correlation (3%). The remaining variability in ADHD behaviors was due to individual-specific environmental factors. Conclusions The intergenerational resemblance of ADHD behaviors is primarily due to genetic transmission, with little evidence for parental ADHD behaviors causing children's ADHD behaviors. This contradicts theories proposing environmental explanations of intergenerational transmission of ADHD, such as parenting theories or psychological life-history theory. © The Author(s), 2023.

Environmental pathways (family functioning, non-kinship care, maltreatment) were specified as potential mediators of PCE. Methods Participants were 372 (190 PCE; 47% male), primarily Black, low socioeconomic status, enrolled at birth. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors were assessed using Youth Self-Report at ages 12 and 15 and Adult Self-Report at age 21. Extended random-intercept cross-lagged panel modeling was used to account for potential bidirectional relationships between internalizing and externalizing behaviors over time, examining potential mediators. Results Adjusting for covariates, significant indirect effects were found for each mediator at different ages. For family functioning, these were both internalizing (β = 0.83, p = 0.04) and externalizing behaviors (β = 1.58, p = 0.02) at age 12 and externalizing behaviors at age 15 (β = 0.51, p = 0.03); for non-kinship care, externalizing behaviors at ages 12 (β = 0.63, p = 0.02) and 15 (β = 0.20, p = 0.03); and for maltreatment, both internalizing and externalizing behaviors at ages 15 (β = 0.64, p = 0.02 for internalizing; β = 0.50, p = 0.03 for externalizing) and 21 (β = 1.39, p = 0.01 for internalizing; β = 1.11, p = 0.01 for externalizing). Direct associations of PCE with internalizing and externalizing behaviors were not observed, nor cross-lagged relationships between internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Conclusions Negative associations of PCE with behavioral adjustment persist into EA via environmental pathways, specifying intervention points to disrupt adverse pathways toward healthy development.

It is not known if attachment styles are prospectively associated with medically documented SAs. Methods A representative sample of US Army soldiers entering service (n = 21 772) was surveyed and followed via administrative records for their first 48 months of service. Attachment style (secure, preoccupied, fearful, dismissing) was assessed at baseline. Administrative medical records identified SAs. Discrete-time survival analysis examined associations of attachment style with future SA during service, adjusting for time in service, socio-demographics, service-related variables, and mental health diagnosis (MH-Dx). We examined whether associations of attachment style with SA differed based on sex and MH-Dx. Results In total, 253 respondents attempted suicide. Endorsed attachment styles included secure (46.8%), preoccupied (9.1%), fearful (15.7%), and dismissing (19.2%). Examined separately, insecure attachment styles were associated with increased odds of SA: preoccupied [OR 2.5 (95% CI 1.7-3.4)], fearful [OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.3)], dismissing [OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.3-2.6)]. Examining attachment styles simultaneously along with other covariates, preoccupied [OR 1.9 (95% CI 1.4-2.7)] and dismissing [OR 1.7 (95% CI 1.2-2.4)] remained significant. The dismissing attachment and MH-Dx interaction was significant. In stratified analyses, dismissing attachment was associated with SA only among soldiers without MH-Dx. Other interactions were non-significant. Soldiers endorsing any insecure attachment style had elevated SA risk across the first 48 months in service, particularly during the first 12 months. Conclusions Insecure attachment styles, particularly preoccupied and dismissing, are associated with increased future SA risk among soldiers. Elevated risk is most substantial during first year of service but persists through the first 48 months. Dismissing attachment may indicate risk specifically among soldiers not identified by the mental healthcare system.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

This survey investigated the mental health outcomes of Australians bereaved during this time to determine how these factors might have impacted bereavement outcomes. Methods An online survey indexing pandemic and bereavement experiences, levels of grief, depression, anxiety, and health, work, and social impairment. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify groups of individuals who shared similar symptom patterns. Multinomial regressions identified pandemic-related, loss-related, and sociodemographic correlates of class membership. Results 1911 Australian adults completed the survey. The LCA identified four classes: low symptoms (46.8%), grief (17.3%), depression/anxiety (17.7%), and grief/depression/anxiety (18.2%). The latter group reported the highest levels of health, work, and social impairment. The death of a child or partner and an inability to care for the deceased due to COVID-19 public health measures were correlated with grief symptoms (with or without depression and anxiety). Preparedness for the person's death and levels of pandemic-related loneliness and social isolation differentiated all four classes. Unemployment was associated with depression/anxiety (with or without grief). Conclusions COVID-19 had profound impacts for the way we lived and died, with effects that are likely to ricochet through society into the foreseeable future. These lessons learned must inform policymakers and healthcare professionals to improve bereavement care and ensure preparedness during and following future predicted pandemics to prevent negative impacts. © The Author(s), 2024.

Longitudinal studies, while rare, would clarify the development of cardiometabolic dysregulations over time. Therefore, we longitudinally investigated the association of CT with the 9-year course of MetS components. Methods Participants (N = 2958) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety were assessed four times across 9 years. The CT interview retrospectively assessed childhood emotional neglect and physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Metabolic outcomes encompassed continuous MetS components (waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, blood pressure [BP], and glucose) and count of clinically elevated MetS components. Mixed-effects models estimated sociodemographic- and lifestyle-adjusted longitudinal associations of CT with metabolic outcomes over time. Time interactions evaluated change in these associations. Results CT was reported by 49% of participants. CT was consistently associated with increased waist (b = 0.32, s.e. = 0.10, p = 0.001), glucose (b = 0.02, s.e. = 0.01, p < 0.001), and count of MetS components (b = 0.04, s.e. = 0.01, p < 0.001); and decreased HDL cholesterol (b = -0.01, s.e.<0.01, p =.020) and systolic BP (b = -0.33, s.e. = 0.13, p = 0.010). These associations were mainly driven by severe CT and unaffected by lifestyle. Only systolic BP showed a CT-by-time interaction, where CT was associated with lower systolic BP initially and with higher systolic BP at the last follow-up. Conclusions Over time, adults with CT have overall persistent poorer metabolic outcomes than their non-maltreated peers. Individuals with CT have an increased risk for cardiometabolic disease and may benefit from monitoring and early interventions targeting metabolism. © The Author(s), 2023.

An important step toward understanding this pattern is to examine geographical distributions of the genetic liability to DUD and a key demographic risk factor - social deprivation. Methods We calculated the mean family genetic risk score (FGRS) for DUD ((FGRSDUD) and social deprivation for each of the 5983 areas Demographic Statistical Areas (DeSO) for all of Sweden and used geospatial techniques to analyze and map these factors. Results Using 2018 data, substantial spatial heterogeneity was seen in the distribution of the genetic risk for DUD in Sweden as a whole and in its three major urban centers which was confirmed by hot-spot analyses. Across DeSOs, FGRSDUD and s.d. levels were substantially but imperfectly correlated (r = + 0.63), with more scattering at higher FGRSDUD and s.d. scores. Joint mapping across DeSOs for FGRSDUD and s.d. revealed a diversity of patterns across Sweden. The stability of the distributions of FGRSDUD and s.d. in DeSOs within Sweden over the years 2012-2018 was quite high. Conclusions The geographical distribution of the genetic risk to DUD is quite variable in Sweden. DeSO levels of s.d. and FRGSDUD were substantially correlated but also disassociated in a number of regions. The observed patterns were largely consistent with known trends in the human geography of Sweden. This effort lays the groundwork for further studies of the sources of geographic variation in rates of DUD. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Later, partial least squares regression and enrichment analysis were performed to probe the correlation between transcription and cortical thickness variation among adults with OCD. Results The cortical map of case-control differences in cortical thickness was spatially correlated with cortical expression of a weighted combination of genes enriched for neurobiologically relevant ontology terms preferentially expressed across different cell types and cortical layers. These genes were specifically expressed in brain tissue, spanning all cortical developmental stages. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that these genes coded a network of proteins encompassing various highly interactive hubs.

Variation between countries is not well understood and thus applying evidence from other countries to national strategies limits support service policy and planning. We therefore examine developmental patterns of youth mental health across different countries using the Growing Up in Ireland (GUI) Cohorts, with comparison to existing UK longitudinal cohort data (Millennium Cohort Study, MCS; Growing up in Scotland, GUS). Methods Youth mental health problems within each cohort across development (5-17/18 years) were assessed using parent reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores. Using latent growth curve analyses, we examined trajectories of emotional, conduct, and hyperactivity problems for boys and girls, separately for each cohort. Results Across cohorts, we observed similar developmental patterns for emotional, conduct, and hyperactivity problems. However, the GUI emotional problems in Ireland emerged earlier than in the UK. By adolescence, GUI emotional scores were similar to the UK, suggesting that the differences in emotional problems between the ROI and UK had narrowed by adolescence. Covariates also had different associations with youth mental health trajectories across cohorts.

The current study therefore investigated if reduced context-dependent modulation of conditioned fear and its underlying neural circuitry constitute risk factors for the development of analog intrusions in response to an experimental trauma. Methods Eighty-five healthy women participated in the trauma film paradigm to investigate the development of analog intrusions as well as explicit memory for an experimental trauma after one week and three months, respectively. Before, participants underwent a context-dependent fear conditioning paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging with fear acquisition in context A and extinction training in context B on a first day, as well as extinction recall in context B and fear renewal in a novel context C one day later. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) and blood oxygen level dependent responses were main outcome measures. Results In addition to stronger fear acquisition in context A, stronger conditioned fear responses in the safe context B, as indicated by stronger conditioned SCRs or stronger activation of fear expressing regions during extinction learning and recall, predicted the development of long-term analog intrusions. Conclusions Stronger fear responses in safe and danger contexts were risk factors for the development of long-term analog intrusions and point to decontextualized fear memories and difficulties in the context-dependent modulation of conditioned fear. Altered fear conditioning processes and reduced storage of contextual information may cause the occurrence of fear independent of context. © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods Children (n = 234, aged 8-17 years) recruited from local Emergency Departments were assessed at two and nine weeks post-trauma. Data obtained from self-report questionnaires completed by the child, telephone interviews with parents, and hospital data were used to develop four predictive models of risk factors for PTSD, CPTSD, depression, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). ICD-11 proposed diagnostic criteria were used to generate measures for CPTSD and PTSD to assess for risk factors and identify the sample prevalence of these disorders. Results At nine weeks post-trauma, 64% did not meet criteria for any disorder, 23.5% met criteria for PTSD, and 5.2% met criteria for CPTSD. 23.9% and 10.7% had developed clinically significant symptoms of depression and GAD, respectively. A cognitive model was the most powerful predictive model, a psychosocial model was weak, and subjective markers of event severity were more powerful than objective measures. Conclusions Youth exposed to single-incident trauma may develop different forms of psychopathology, and PTSD and CPTSD are frequently experienced alongside other conditions. The cognitive model of PTSD shows utility in identifying predictors of PTSD, CPTSD, depression, and GAD, particularly the role of trauma-related negative appraisals. This supports the application of cognitive interventions which focus upon re-appraising trauma-related beliefs in youth.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

This study aimed to investigate the dose-dependent effects of vitamin D supplementation on depressive and anxiety symptoms in adults. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science up to December 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on depression and anxiety symptoms in adults. Using a random-effects model, we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) for each 1000 IU/day vitamin D3 supplementation. The GRADE tool assessed the certainty of evidence. Our analysis included 31 trials with 24189 participants. Each 1000 IU/day vitamin D3 supplementation slightly reduced depressive symptoms in individuals with and without depression (SMD: −0.32, 95% CI −0.43 to −0.22; GEADE = moderate). The effect was more pronounced in those with depressive symptoms (SMD: −0.57, 95% CI −0.69 to −0.44; n = 15). The greatest reduction occurred at 8000 IU/day (SMD: −2.04, 95% CI −3.77 to −0.31). Trials with follow-up 8 weeks (SMD: −0.45, 95% CI −0.70 to −0.20; n = 8) and 8 to 24 weeks (SMD: −0.47, 95% CI −0.70 to −0.24; n = 15) showed stronger effects compared to those lasting 24 to 52 weeks (SMD: −0.13, 95% CI −0.28 to 0.02; n = 5) or longer than 52 weeks (SMD: 0.14, 95% CI −0.16 to 0.44; n = 3) (p group difference <0.001). Vitamin D3 supplementation had no significant effects on anxiety symptoms. In summary, this study suggests that vitamin D3 supplementation may effectively reduce depressive symptoms in short term.

Machine learning (ML) has developed classifiers differentiating patient groups despite concerns regarding diagnostic reliability. An alternative strategy, used here, is to develop a functional classifier (hyperplane) (e.g. distinguishing the neural responses to received reward v. received punishment in typically developing (TD) adolescents) and then determine the functional integrity of the response (reward response distance from the hyperplane) in adolescents with externalizing and internalizing conditions and its associations with symptom clusters. Methods. Two hundred and ninety nine adolescents (mean age = 15.07 ± 2.30 years, 117 females) were divided into three groups: a training sample of TD adolescents where the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was applied (N = 65; 32 females), and two test groups– an independent sample of TD adolescents (N = 39; 14 females) and adolescents with a psychiatric diagnosis (major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) & conduct disorder (CD); N = 195, 71 females). Results. SVM ML analysis identified a hyperplane with accuracy = 80.77%, sensitivity = 78.38% and specificity = 88.99% that implicated feature neural regions associated with reward v. punishment (e.g. nucleus accumbens v. anterior insula cortices). Adolescents with externalizing diagnoses were significantly less likely to show a normative and significantly more likely to show a deficient reward response than the TD samples. Deficient reward response was associated with elevated CD, MDD, and ADHD symptoms. Conclusions. Distinguishing the response to reward relative to punishment in TD adolescents via ML indicated notable disruptions in this response in patients with CD and ADHD and associations between reward responsiveness and CD, MDD, and ADHD symptom severity. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Additionally, Black American individuals are underrepresented in studies, limiting translational impact. We tested independent and interactive effects of preconception and prenatal vitamin D in Black women in relation to positive behavioral and emotional outcomes in early childhood. Methods Black-identifying participants (N = 156) enrolled in the longitudinal Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS) provided venous blood samples before and during pregnancy to measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels. Participants completed questionnaires assessing sociodemographic factors, depression severity and life stress, and later reported on child behavioral and emotional problems and prosocial behavior between 2 and 4 years. Results Mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations were 15.5 ng/ml (s.d. = 7.7) before pregnancy and 18.0 ng/ml (s.d. = 9.2) during pregnancy; below the sufficiency threshold according to commonly used dietary guidelines. After adjusting for covariates, prenatal 25(OH)D was negatively related to behavior problems and positively related to prosocial behavior in children, although the association attenuated for behavior problems after accounting for preconception 25(OH)D, which may reflect patterns of stability. Maternal 25(OH)D was unrelated to child emotional problems, and no synergistic effects of 25(OH)D timing were observed for any child outcome. Conclusions Findings have relevance for Black women living in the northeast U.S. Results suggest specific associations between maternal vitamin D and positive behaviors in early childhood, regardless of sufficiency levels and suggest potential opportunities for early interventions to support healthy child development.

In this study, we identified illness trajectories across major clinical domains that could have etiological, prognostic, and therapeutic relevance. Methods Using the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) study, we performed univariate and multivariate trajectory modeling of depressive symptoms, manic symptoms, and psychosocial functioning. Multinomial regression was performed to identify baseline variables associated with poor outcome trajectories. Results Depressive symptoms predominated, with most subjects being found in trajectories characterized by various degrees of depressive symptoms and 13% of subjects being classified in a poor outcome 'persistently depressed' trajectory. Most subjects experienced few manic symptoms, although approximately 10% of subjects followed a trajectory of persistently manic symptoms. Trajectory analysis of psychosocial functioning showed impairment in most of the sample, with little improvement during follow up. Multi-trajectory analyses highlighted significant impairment in subjects with persistently mixed and persistently depressed trajectories of illness. In general, poor outcome trajectories were marked by lower educational attainment, higher unemployment and disability, and a greater likelihood of adverse clinical features (rapid cycling and suicide attempts) and comorbid diagnoses (anxiety disorders, PTSD, and substance abuse/dependence disorders). Conclusions Subjects with BD can be classified into several trajectories of clinically relevant domains that are prognostically relevant and show differing degrees of associations with a broad range of negative clinical risk factors. The highest level of psychosocial disability was found in subjects with chronic mixed and depressive symptoms, who show limited improvement despite guideline-based treatment. © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods Swedish-born individuals (1972-1995, N = 1 997 910) were followed through 12-31-2018, at mean age 34.9. We predicted, from these educational transitions, risk for major depression (MD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (BD), schizophrenia (SZ), anorexia nervosa (AN), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and drug use disorder (DUD), assessed from Swedish national registers, by Cox regression, censoring individuals with onsets ≤17. We also predicted risk from the deviation of grades from family-genetic expectations (deviation 1) and from changes in grades from ages 16 to 19 (deviation 2). Results We observed four major risk patterns across transitions in our disorders: (i) MD and BD, (ii) OCD and SZ, (iii) AUD and DUD, and (iv) AN. Failing early educational transitions had the greatest impact on risk for OCD and SZ while for other disorders, not progressing from basic to upper high school had the largest effect. Completing vocational v. college-prep upper high school was strongly associated with risk for AUD and DUD, had little relation with MD, OCD, BD, and SZ risk, and was protective for AN.

However, the type- and timing-specific effects of emotional maltreatment experienced during adolescence on future depressive symptomatology in women with CSA have not been explored. The goal of this study was to fill this gap. Methods In total, 203 women (ages 20-32) with current depressive symptoms and CSA (MDD/CSA), remitted depressive symptoms and CSA (rMDD/CSA), and current depressive symptoms without CSA (MDD/no CSA) were recruited from the community and completed self-report measures. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and a detailed maltreatment history was collected using the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology of Exposure (MACE). Differences in maltreatment exposure characteristics, including multiplicity and severity of maltreatment, as well as the chronologies of emotional maltreatment subtypes were compared among groups. A random forest machine-learning algorithm was utilized to assess the impact of exposure to emotional maltreatment subtypes at specific ages on current depressive symptoms. Results MDD/CSA women reported greater prevalence and severity of emotional maltreatment relative to rMDD/CSA and MDD/no CSA women [F(2,196) = 9.33, p < 0.001], specifically from ages 12 to 18. The strongest predictor of current depressive symptoms was parental verbal abuse at age 18 for both MDD/CSA women (variable importance [VI] = 1.08, p = 0.006) and MDD/no CSA women (VI = 0.68, p = 0.004). Conclusions Targeting emotional maltreatment during late adolescence might prove beneficial for future intervention efforts for MDD following CSA. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

The neural correlates underlying late-life depressive symptoms and cognitive deterioration are largely unclear, and little is known about the role of chronic physical conditions in such association. This research explores both concurrent and longitudinal associations between late-life depressive symptoms and cognitive functions, with examining the neural substrate and chronic vascular diseases (CVDs) in these associations. Methods. A total of 4109 participants (mean age = 65.4, 63.0% females) were evaluated for cognitive functions through various neuropsychological assessments. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale and CVDs were self-reported. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging, and functional MRI (fMRI) data were acquired in a subsample (n = 791). Results. Cognitively, higher depressive symptoms were correlated with poor performance across all cognitive domains, with the strongest association with episodic memory (r = -0.138, p < 0.001). Regarding brain structure, depressive symptoms were negatively correlated with thalamic volume and white matter integrity. Further, white matter integrity was found to mediate the longitudinal association between depressive symptoms and episodic memory (indirect effect = -0.017, 95% CI -0.045 to -0.002) and this mediation was only significant for those with severe CVDs (β = -0.177, p = 0.008). Conclusions. This study is one of the first to provide neural evidence elucidating the longitudinal associations between late-life depressive symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. Additionally, the severity of CVDs strengthened these associations, which enlightens the potential of managing CVDs as an intervention target for preventing depressive symptoms-related cognitive decline. © The Author(s), 2024.

Despite the growing interest in the prevalence and consequences of loneliness, the way it is measured still raises a number of questions. In particular, few studies have directly compared the psychometric properties of very short measures of loneliness to standard measures. Methods. We conducted a large epidemiological study of midwife students (n = 1742) and performed a head-to-head comparison of the psychometric properties of the standard (20 items) and short version (3 items) of the UCLA Loneliness Scales (UCLA-LS). All participants completed the UCLA-LS-20, UCLA-LS-3, as well as other measures of mental health, including anxiety and depression. Results. First, as predicted, we found that the two loneliness scales were strongly associated with each other. Second, when using the dimensional scores of the scales, we showed that the internal reliability, convergent-, discriminant-, and known-groups validities were high and of similar magnitude between the UCLA-LS-20 and the UCLA-LS-3. Third, when the scales were dichotomized, the results were more mixed. The sensitivity and/or specificity of the UCLA-LS-3 against the UCLA-LS-20 were systematically below acceptable thresholds, regardless of the dichotomizing process used. In addition, the prevalence of loneliness was strikingly variable as a function of the cut-offs used. Conclusions. Overall, we showed that the UCLA-LS-3 provided an adequate dimensional measure of loneliness that is very similar to the UCLA-LS-20. On the other hand, we were able to highlight more marked differences between the scales when their scores were dichotomized, which has important consequences for studies estimating, for example, the prevalence of loneliness. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Most studies use observed sum scores to document trends but fail to assess whether their measures are invariant across time, a prerequisite for meaningful inferences about change. We examined whether measurement noninvariance, indicative of changing perceptions and reporting of symptoms, may influence the assessment of time trends in adolescent depressive symptoms. Methods Data stem from the nationwide repeated cross-sectional Ungdata-surveys (2010-2019) of 560 712 responses from adolescents aged 13 to 19 years. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Kandel and Davies' six-item Depressive Mood Inventory. Using structural equation modeling, we examined measurement invariance across time, gender and age, and estimated the consequences of noninvariance on cross-cohort time trends. Results Across most conditions, the instrument was found measurement invariant across time. The few noninvariant parameters detected had negligible impact on trend estimates. From 2014, latent mean depressive symptom scores increased among girls. For boys, a U shaped pattern was detected, whereby an initial decrease in symptoms was followed by an increase from 2016. Larger issues of noninvariance were found across age in girls and between genders. Conclusions From a measurement perspective, the notion that changed reporting of symptoms has been an important driver of secular trends in depressive symptoms was not supported. Thus, other causes of these trends should be considered. However, noninvariance across age (in girls) and gender highlights that depressive symptoms are not necessarily perceived equivalently from early to late adolescence and across gender.

However, few fully implemented ACT have been conducted on the neural mechanisms underlying its effect on OCD. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate the neural correlates of ACT in patients with OCD using task-based and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods Patients with OCD were randomly assigned to the ACT (n = 21) or the wait-list control group (n = 21). An 8-week group-format ACT program was provided to the ACT group. All participants underwent an fMRI scan and psychological measurements before and after 8 weeks. Results Patients with OCD showed significantly increased activation in the bilateral insula and superior temporal gyri (STG), induced by the thought-action fusion task after ACT intervention. Further psycho-physiological interaction analyses with these regions as seeds revealed that the left insular-left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) connectivity was strengthened in the ACT group after treatment. Increased resting-state functional connectivity was also found in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, and lingual gyrus after ACT intervention Most of these regions showed significant correlations with ACT process measures while only the right insula was correlated with the obsessive-compulsive symptom measure. Conclusions These findings suggest that the therapeutic effect of ACT on OCD may involve the salience and interoception processes (i.e. insula), multisensory integration (i.e. STG), language (i.e. IFG), and self-referential processes (i.e. PCC and precuneus). These areas or their interactions could be important for understanding how ACT works psychologically.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) can distinguish the profiles of these disorders according to gray matter (GM) volumes. We integrated findings from previous VBM studies for comparative analysis and extended the research into molecular profiles to facilitate inspection and intervention. Methods We comprehensively searched PubMed and Web of Science for VBM studies that compared LLD and MCI cases with matched healthy controls (HCs) from inception to 31st December 2023. We included 13 studies on LLD (414 LLDs, 350 HCs) and 50 on MCI (1878 MCIs, 2046 HCs). Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) was used for voxel-based meta-analysis to assess GM atrophy, spatially correlated with neuropsychological profiles. We then used multimodal and linear-model analysis to assess the similarities and differences in GM volumetric changing patterns. Partial least squares (PLS) regression and gene enrichment were employed for transcription-neuroimaging associations. Results GM volumes in the left hippocampus and right parahippocampal gyrus are more affected in MCI, along with memory impairment. MCI was spatially correlated with a more extensive reduction in the levels of neurotransmitters and a severe downregulation of genes related to cellular potassium ion transport and metal ion transmembrane transporter activity. Conclusion Compared to LLD, MCI exhibited more GM atrophy in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus and lower gene expression of ion transmembrane transport. Our findings provided imaging-transcriptomic-genetic integrative profiles for differential diagnosis and precise intervention between LLD and MCI.

Personality relates to mental health and can be used to probe the nature of PT's therapeutic action. Methods In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, active comparator controlled trial involving patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, over a core 6-week trial period. Five-Factor model personality domains, Big Five Aspect Scale Openness aspects, Absorption, and Impulsivity were measured at Baseline, Week 6, and Month 6 follow-up. Results PT was associated with decreases in neuroticism (B = -0.63), introversion (B = -0.38), disagreeableness (B = -0.47), impulsivity (B = -0.40), and increases in absorption (B = 0.32), conscientiousness (B = 0.30), and openness (B = 0.23) at week 6, with neuroticism (B = -0.47) and disagreeableness (B = -0.41) remaining decreased at month 6. Escitalopram Treatment (ET) was associated with decreases in neuroticism (B = -0.38), disagreeableness (B = -0.26), impulsivity (B = -0.35), and increases in openness (B = 0.28) at week 6, with neuroticism (B = -0.46) remaining decreased at month 6. No significant between-condition differences were observed. Conclusions Personality changes across both conditions were in a direction consistent with improved mental health. With the possible exception of trait absorption, there were no compelling between-condition differences warranting conclusions regarding a selective action of PT (v. ET) on personality; however, post-ET changes in personality were significantly moderated by pre-trial positive expectancy for escitalopram, whereas expectancy did not moderate response to PT.  © 2023 The Author(s).

We studied whether abnormalities in gray matter volume (GMV) could be a mechanism linking childhood unpredictability and psychopathology, over and above the effect of childhood trauma. Methods Participants were 158 right-handed healthy young adults (aged 17-28 years, M = 22.07, s.d. = 2.08; 66.46% female) who underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging measurements and provided retrospective reports of childhood unpredictability. The anxiety and depression subscales of the self-report Brief Symptom Inventory-53 were used to index psychopathology. Results Whole-brain voxel-based morphometric analyses showed that after controlling for the effect of childhood trauma, childhood unpredictability was correlated with greater GMV in bilateral frontal pole, bilateral precuneus, bilateral postcentral gyrus, right hemisphere of fusiform, and lingual gyrus, and left hemisphere of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex as well as occipital gyrus. Greater GMV in bilateral frontal pole, bilateral precuneus, and bilateral postcentral gyrus mediated associations between unpredictability and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Conclusions The findings suggest that childhood unpredictability could exact unique effects on neural development, over and above the effect of childhood trauma. These findings are relevant for understanding the occurrence of psychopathology following childhood unpredictability and have implications for intervention.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

We aimed to identify the common types of outcome trajectories for patients with psychosis who take up specialist psychological therapy for persecutory delusions. Knowing the different potential responses to therapy can inform expectations. Further, determining predictors of different outcomes may help in understanding who may benefit. Methods. We analyzed delusion conviction data from 767 therapy sessions with 64 patients with persistent persecutory delusions (held with at least 60% conviction) who received a six-month psychological intervention (Feeling Safe) during a clinical trial. Latent class trajectory analysis was conducted to identify groups with distinct outcome profiles. The trajectories were validated against independent assessments, including a longer-term follow-up six months after the end of therapy. We also tested potential predictors of the trajectories. Results. There were four outcome trajectories: (1) Very high delusion conviction/Little improvement (n = 14, 25%), (2) Very high delusion conviction/Large improvement (n = 9, 16%), (3) High delusion conviction/Moderate improvement (n = 17, 31%) and (4) High delusion conviction/Large improvement (n = 15, 27%). The groups did not differ in initial overall delusion severity. The trajectories were consistent with the independent assessments and sustained over time. Three factors predicted trajectories: persecutory delusion conviction, therapy expectations, and positive beliefs about other people. Conclusions. There are variable responses to psychological therapy for persecutory delusions. Patients with very high delusion conviction can have excellent responses to therapy, though this may take a little longer to observe and such high conviction reduces the likelihood of positive responses. A trajectory approach requires testing in larger datasets but may prove highly informative. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

In contemporary neuroimaging studies, it has been observed that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibit aberrant spontaneous neural activity, commonly quantified through the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF). However, the substantial individual heterogeneity among patients poses a challenge to reaching a unified conclusion. Methods. To address this variability, our study adopts a novel framework to parse individualized ALFF abnormalities. We hypothesize that individualized ALFF abnormalities can be portrayed as a unique linear combination of shared differential factors. Our study involved two large multi-center datasets, comprising 2424 patients with MDD and 2183 healthy controls. In patients, individualized ALFF abnormalities were derived through normative modeling and further deconstructed into differential factors using non-negative matrix factorization. Results. Two positive and two negative factors were identified. These factors were closely linked to clinical characteristics and explained group-level ALFF abnormalities in the two datasets. Moreover, these factors exhibited distinct associations with the distribution of neurotransmitter receptors/transporters, transcriptional profiles of inflammation-related genes, and connectome-informed epicenters, underscoring their neurobiological relevance. Additionally, factor compositions facilitated the identification of four distinct depressive subtypes, each characterized by unique abnormal ALFF patterns and clinical features. Importantly, these findings were successfully replicated in another dataset with different acquisition equipment, protocols, preprocessing strategies, and medication statuses, validating their robustness and generalizability. Conclusions. This research identifies shared differential factors underlying individual spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in MDD and contributes novel insights into the heterogeneity of spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in MDD. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Many forms of psychopathology are characterized by dysfunctional emotional reactivity. The late positive potential (LPP) is an event-related potential component that provides an index of neurobiological emotional reactivity. Several categorical disorders have demonstrated a similar association with the emotion-modulated LPP. It is possible that higher-order dimensional representations of psychopathology might explain the comparable results. The present study examined the association between HiTOP-consistent pathological personality dimensions across multiple levels of the hierarchy and neurobiological emotional reactivity. Methods The sample included 215 18-35-year-old adults (86% female) who were oversampled for psychopathology. Participants completed the emotional interrupt task while electroencephalography was recorded to examine the LPP. Participants also completed the Comprehensive Assessment of Traits relevant to Personality Disorders to assess pathological personality. Results At the spectra level, higher negative emotionality was associated with a larger emotion-modulated LPP, while higher detachment was associated with a smaller emotion-modulated LPP. There were no associations between higher-order psychopathology levels and the emotion-modulated LPP. Compared to categorical diagnoses, spectra-level personality pathology dimensions significantly improved the prediction of the emotion-modulated LPP. Conclusions The present study indicates that HiTOP spectra levels of negative emotionality and detachment demonstrate unique associations with neurobiological emotional reactivity.

The association between cannabis and psychosis is established, but the role of underlying genetics is unclear. We used data from the EU-GEI case-control study and UK Biobank to examine the independent and combined effect of heavy cannabis use and schizophrenia polygenic risk score (PRS) on risk for psychosis. Methods. Genome-wide association study summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort were used to calculate schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder (CUD) PRS for 1098 participants from the EU-GEI study and 143600 from the UK Biobank. Both datasets had information on cannabis use. Results. In both samples, schizophrenia PRS and cannabis use independently increased risk of psychosis. Schizophrenia PRS was not associated with patterns of cannabis use in the EU-GEI cases or controls or UK Biobank cases. It was associated with lifetime and daily cannabis use among UK Biobank participants without psychosis, but the effect was substantially reduced when CUD PRS was included in the model. In the EU-GEI sample, regular users of high-potency cannabis had the highest odds of being a case independently of schizophrenia PRS (OR daily use high-potency cannabis adjusted for PRS = 5.09, 95% CI 3.08–8.43, p = 3.21 × 10-10). We found no evidence of interaction between schizophrenia PRS and patterns of cannabis use. Conclusions. Regular use of high-potency cannabis remains a strong predictor of psychotic disorder independently of schizophrenia PRS, which does not seem to be associated with heavy cannabis use. These are important findings at a time of increasing use and potency of cannabis worldwide. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Aggression represents a salient risk factor for suicide among civilians, yet is relatively understudied among military populations. Although several theories posit a relation between aggression and suicide with putative underlying mechanisms of social isolation, access to firearms, and alcohol use, researchers have yet to test these potential mediators. This study uses rich, longitudinal data from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience (STARRS) Pre/Post Deployment Study (PPDS) to examine whether aggression longitudinally predicts suicide attempts and to identify mediators of this association. Methods Army soldiers (N = 8483) completed assessments 1 month prior to deployment and 1, 2-3, and 9-12 months post-deployment. Participants reported on their physical and verbal aggression, suicide attempts, social network size, firearm ownership, and frequency of alcohol use. Results As expected, pre-deployment aggression was significantly associated with suicide attempts at 12-months post-deployment even after controlling for lifetime suicide attempts. Social network size and alcohol use frequency mediated this association, but firearm ownership did not. Conclusions Findings further implicate aggression as an important suicide risk factor among military personnel and suggest that social isolation and alcohol use may partially account for this association.

We aimed to estimate the association between baseline network connectivity and treatment response in a large sample and benchmark its prognostic value against baseline symptom severity and variance. Methods N = 40 518 patients receiving treatment for depression in routine care in England from 2015-2020 were analysed. Cross-sectional networks were constructed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for responders and non-responders (N = 20 259 each). To conduct parametric tests investigating the contribution of PHQ-9 sum score mean and variance to connectivity differences, networks were constructed for 160 independent subsamples of responders and non-responders (80 each, n = 250 per sample). Results The baseline non-responder network was more connected than responders (3.15 v. 2.70, S = 0.44, p < 0.001), but effects were small, requiring n = 750 per group to have 85% power. Parametric analyses revealed baseline network connectivity, PHQ-9 sum score mean, and PHQ-9 sum score variance were correlated (r = 0.20-0.58, all p < 0.001). Both PHQ-9 sum score mean (β = -1.79, s.e. = 0.07, p < 0.001), and PHQ-9 sum score variance (β = -1.67, s.e. = 0.09, p < 0.001) had larger effect sizes for predicting response than connectivity (β = -1.35, s.e. = 0.12, p < 0.001). The association between connectivity and response disappeared when PHQ-9 sum score variance was accounted for (β = -0.28, s.e. = 0.19, p = 0.14). We replicated these results in patients completing longer treatment (8-12 weeks, N = 22 952) and using anxiety symptom networks (N = 70 620). Conclusions The association between baseline network connectivity and treatment response may be largely due to differences in baseline score variance.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a debilitating condition characterized by pervasive instability across multiple major domains of functioning. The majority of persons with BPD engage in self-injury and up to 10% die by suicide – rendering persons with this condition at exceptionally elevated risk of comorbidity and premature mortality. Better characterization of clinical risk factors among persons with BPD who die by suicide is urgently needed. Methods. We examined patterns of medical and psychiatric diagnoses (1580 to 1700 Phecodes) among persons with BPD who died by suicide (n = 379) via a large suicide death data resource and biobank. In phenotype-based phenome-wide association tests, we compared these individuals to three other groups: (1) persons who died by suicide without a history of BPD (n = 9468), (2) persons still living with a history of BPD diagnosis (n = 280), and (3) persons who died by suicide with a different personality disorder (other PD n = 589). Results. Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that persons with BPD who died by suicide were more likely to present with co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses, and have a documented history of self-harm in the medical system prior to death, relative to suicides without BPD. Posttraumatic stress disorder was more elevated among those with BPD who died by suicide relative to the other PD group. Conclusions. We found significant differences among persons with BPD who died by suicide and all other comparison groups. Such differences may be clinically informative for identifying high-risk subtypes and providing targeted intervention approaches. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

However, little is known about how brain structure and inflammation relate to the heterogeneity of treatment response in the months following an index ECT course. Methods A naturalistic six-month study following an index ECT course included 20 subjects with treatment-resistant depression. Upon conclusion of the index ECT course and again after six months, structural magnetic resonance imaging scans and peripheral inflammation measures [interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), and C-reactive protein] were obtained. Voxel-based morphometry processed with the CAT-12 Toolbox was used to estimate changes in gray matter volume. Results Between the end of the index ECT course and the end of follow-up, we found four clusters of significant decreases in gray matter volume (p < 0.01, FWE) and no regions of increased volume. Decreased HAM-D scores were significantly related only to reduced IL-8 level. Decreased volume in one cluster, which included the right insula and Brodmann's Area 22, was related to increased HAM-D scores over six months. IL-8 levels did not mediate or moderate the relationship between volumetric change and depression. Conclusions Six months after an index ECT course, multiple regions of decreased gray matter volume were observed in a naturalistic setting. The independent relations between brain volume and inflammation to depressive symptoms suggest novel explanations of the heterogeneity of longer-term ECT treatment response. © The Author(s), 2023.

Prior work by our team identified clinically significant executive function (EF) deficits in 47% of individuals with 3q29del; however, the nuances of EF in this population have not been described. Methods We used the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) to perform the first in-depth assessment of real-world EF in a cohort of 32 individuals with 3q29del (62.5% male, mean age = 14.5 ± 8.3 years). All participants were also evaluated with gold-standard neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments. High-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a subset of participants (n = 24). Results We found global deficits in EF; individuals with 3q29del scored higher than the population mean on the BRIEF global executive composite (GEC) and all subscales. In total, 81.3% of study subjects (n = 26) scored in the clinical range on at least one BRIEF subscale. BRIEF GEC T scores were higher among 3q29del participants with a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and BRIEF GEC T scores were associated with schizophrenia spectrum symptoms as measured by the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes. BRIEF GEC T scores were not associated with cognitive ability. The BRIEF-2 ADHD form accurately (sensitivity = 86.7%) classified individuals with 3q29del based on ADHD diagnosis status. BRIEF GEC T scores were correlated with cerebellar white matter and subregional cerebellar cortex volumes. Conclusions Together, these data expand our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum of 3q29del and identify EF as a core feature linked to both psychiatric and neuroanatomical features of the syndrome.

This study included 15 RCTs up until 15 June 2024, with 905 participants. Results showed significant improvements in BDD symptoms (g = -0.97), depression (g = -0.51), anxiety (g = -0.72), insight/delusion (g = -0.57), psychosocial functioning (g = 0.45), and quality of life (g = 0.44), with effects sustained from 1 to 6 months follow-up. RCTs with a waitlist/inactive control reported larger effect sizes for post-intervention BDD symptoms compared to those with a placebo/active control group. In addition, studies with low risk of bias demonstrate larger effect sizes for post-intervention psychosocial functioning compared to studies with some concerns. Notably, the presence of exposure and response prevention in the treatment, as well as the mode of delivery (face-to-face or digital), did not have a significant impact on the intervention outcomes. Females exhibited greater effect sizes in post-intervention BDD symptoms and psychosocial functioning than males. With increasing age, the effect size for insight/delusion symptoms diminished. Longer session duration was associated with larger effect sizes for BDD symptoms, depression at post-treatment, and depression at follow-up. TSA indicated robust evidence for depression at post-treatment and BDD symptoms, while the remaining outcome variables did not meet the desired level of evidence. In conclusion, this study underscores the effectiveness of psychological treatments in reducing BDD symptoms and improving related outcomes, highlighting the need for further research to confirm the impact of these therapies on other outcomes.

However, few studies have examined the relative contribution of PTSD compared to broader post-traumatic sequelae in maintaining psychosis. Complex PTSD (cPTSD), operationalized using ICD-11 criteria, includes core PTSD (intrusions, avoidance, hyperarousal) as well as additional ""disturbances of self-organisation""(DSO; emotional dysregulation, interpersonal difficulties, negative self-concept) symptoms, more likely to be associated with complex trauma histories. It was hypothesized that DSOs would be associated with positive psychotic symptoms (paranoia, voices, and visions) in daily life, over and above core PTSD symptoms. Methods This study (N = 153) employed a baseline subsample of the Study of Trauma And Recovery (STAR), a clinical sample of participants with comorbid post-traumatic stress and psychosis symptoms. Core PTSD, DSO and psychosis symptoms were assessed up to 10 times per day at quasi-random intervals over six consecutive days using Experience Sampling Methodology. Results DSOs within the preceding 90 min predicted paranoia, voices, and visions at subsequent moments. These relationships persisted when controlling for core PTSD symptoms within this timeframe, which were themselves significant. The associations between DSOs and paranoia but not voices or visions, were significantly stronger than those between psychosis and core PTSD symptoms. Conclusions Consistent with an affective pathway to psychosis, the findings suggest that DSOs may be more important than core PTSD symptoms in maintaining psychotic experiences in daily life among people with comorbid psychosis and cPTSD, and indicate the potential importance of addressing broad post-traumatic sequelae in trauma-focused psychosis interventions.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by severe impairments in reward processing, but the neural effects of social touch in MDD are still elusive. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the neural processing of social touch is altered in MDD and to assess the impact of antidepressant therapy. Methods Before and after antidepressant treatment, 53 MDD patients and 41 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while receiving social touch. We compared neural responses to social touch in the reward network, behavioral ratings of touch comfort and general aversion to interpersonal touch in patients to controls. Additionally, we examined the effect of treatment response on those measures. Results Clinical symptoms decreased after treatment and 43.4% of patients were classified as responders. Patients reported higher aversion to interpersonal touch and lower comfort ratings during the fMRI paradigm than controls. Patients showed reduced responses to social touch in the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus and putamen than controls, both before and after treatment. Contrary to our hypotheses, these effects were independent of touch velocity. Non-responders exhibited blunted response in the caudate nucleus and the insula compared to responders, again irrespective of time. Conclusions These findings suggest altered striatal processing of social touch in MDD. Persistent dysfunctional processing of social touch despite clinical improvements may constitute a latent risk factor for social withdrawal and isolation.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Genetic vulnerability to mental disorders has been associated with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outcomes. We explored whether polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for several mental disorders predicted poorer clinical and psychological COVID-19 outcomes in people with pre-existing depression. Methods. Data from three assessments of the Australian Genetics of Depression Study (N = 4405; 52.2 years ± 14.9; 76.2% females) were analyzed. Outcomes included COVID-19 clinical outcomes (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection and long COVID, noting the low incidence of COVID-19 cases in Australia at that time) and COVID-19 psychological outcomes (COVID-related stress and COVID-19 burnout). Predictors included PRS for depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and anxiety. The associations between these PRSs and the outcomes were assessed with adjusted linear/logistic/multinomial regressions. Mediation (N = 4338) and moderation (N = 3326) analyses were performed to explore the potential influence of anxiety symptoms and resilience on the identified associations between the PRSs and COVID-19 psychological outcomes. Results. None of the selected PRS predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection or long COVID. In contrast, the depression PRS predicted higher levels of COVID-19 burnout. Anxiety symptoms fully mediated the association between the depression PRS and COVID-19 burnout. Resilience did not moderate this association. Conclusions. A higher genetic risk for depression predicted higher COVID-19 burnout and this association was fully mediated by anxiety symptoms. Interventions targeting anxiety symptoms may be effective in mitigating the psychological effects of a pandemic among people with depression. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Delirium is a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome caused by physical illness, associated with high mortality. Understanding risk factors for delirium is key to targeting prevention and screening. Whether severe mental illness (SMI) predisposes people to delirium is not known. We aimed to establish whether pre-existing SMI diagnosis is associated with higher risk of delirium diagnosis and mortality following delirium diagnosis. Methods. A retrospective cohort and nested case–control study using linked primary and secondary healthcare databases from 2000–2017. We identified people diagnosed with SMI, matched to non-SMI comparators. We compared incidence of delirium diagnoses between people with SMI diagnoses and comparators, and between SMI subtypes; schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and ‘other psychosis’. We compared 30-day mortality following a hospitalisation involving delirium between people with SMI diagnoses and comparators, and between SMI subtypes. Results. We identified 20 566 people with SMI diagnoses, matched to 71 374 comparators. Risk of delirium diagnosis was higher for all SMI subtypes, with a higher risk conferred by SMI in the under 65-year group, (aHR:7.65, 95% CI 5.45–10.7, ≥65-year group: aHR:3.35, 95% CI 2.77–4.05). Compared to people without SMI, people with an SMI diagnosis overall had no difference in 30-day mortality following a hospitalisation involving delirium (OR:0.66, 95% CI 0.38–1.14). Conclusions. We found an association between SMI and delirium diagnoses. People with SMI may be more vulnerable to delirium when in hospital than people without SMI. There are limitations to using electronic healthcare records and further prospective study is needed to confirm these findings. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Methods Study 1, a pre-registered experiment, involved approximately 200 participants (42.66% female; mean age: 36.86; standard deviation of age: 10.70) making numerical judgments at two time-points. ADHD-symptom severity was assessed on a continuous scale. In Study 2, we collected the data of approximately 3000 examinees who had taken a high-stakes admissions test for higher education (assessing quantitative and verbal reasoning). The sample comprised only people formally diagnosed with ADHD. The control group consisted of approximately 200 000 examinees, none of whom presented with ADHD. Results The results of Study 1 revealed a positive correlation between IIV (distance between judgments at the two time-points) and ADHD symptom severity. The results of Study 2 demonstrated that IIV (distance between the scores on two test chapters assessing the same type of reasoning) was greater among examinees diagnosed with ADHD. In both studies, the findings persisted even after controlling for performance level. Conclusions The results indicate that individuals with ADHD, v. those without, exhibit less consistent numerosity judgments and greater fluctuation in performance on verbal and quantitative reasoning. The measurement of the same psychological constructs appears to be less precise among individuals with ADHD compared to those without. We discuss the theoretical contributions and practical implications of our results for two fields: judgment and decision-making, and assessment.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

Cognitive impairment constitutes a prevailing issue in the schizophrenia spectrum, severely impacting patients’ functional outcomes. A global cognitive score, sensitive to the stages of the spectrum, would benefit the exploration of potential factors involved in the cognitive decline. Methods. First, we performed principal component analysis on cognitive scores from 768 individuals across the schizophrenia spectrum, including first-degree relatives of patients, individuals at ultra-high risk, who had a first-episode psychosis, and chronic schizophrenia patients, alongside 124 healthy controls. The analysis provided 10 g-factors as global cognitive scores, validated through correlations with intelligence quotient and assessed for their sensitivity to the stages on the spectrum using analyses of variance. Second, using the g-factors, we explored potential mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in the schizophrenia spectrum using correlations with sociodemographic, clinical, and developmental data, and linear regressions with genotypic data, pooled through meta-analyses. Results. The g-factors were highly correlated with intelligence quotient and with each other, confirming their validity. They presented significant differences between subgroups along the schizophrenia spectrum. They were positively correlated with educational attainment and the polygenic risk score (PRS) for cognitive performance, and negatively correlated with general psychopathology of schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental load, and the PRS for schizophrenia. Conclusions. The g-factors appeared as valid estimators of global cognition, enabling discerning cognitive states within the schizophrenia spectrum. Educational attainment and genetics related to cognitive performance may have a positive influence on cognitive functioning, while general psychopathology of schizophrenia, neurodevelopmental load, and genetic liability to schizophrenia may have an adverse impact. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

We investigate whether age at onset (AAO) reflects genetic heterogeneity, utilizing Genetic Risk Ratios (GRR) derived from Family Genetic Risk Scores (FGRS). Methods We examined, in individuals born in Sweden 1940-2003, whether AAO for five primary disorders - drug use disorder (DUD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SZ) - was associated with varying levels of GRRs with a range of informative secondary disorders and traits. Results Our disorders displayed a varying pattern of change of GRRs with increasing AAO. At one end was SZ, where all GRRs rose with increasing AAO meaning that SZ became increasing genetically heterogeneous with later AAO. The most balanced disorder was AUD where, with increasing AAO, GRRs rose for AD, BD, and MD and declined for DUD, CB, and ADHD. That is, at young AAO, AUD had high levels of genetic risk for other externalizing disorders while at older AAO, high genetic risk for internalizing disorders were more prominent. MD was at the continuum's other end where all GRRs, except for AD, decreased with higher AAO, meaning that MD became increasingly genetically homogeneous with later AAO. Conclusions Genetic heterogeneity was robustly associated with AAO across our five primary disorders with substantial inter-disorder differences in the observed patterns. In particular, young AAO was associated with maximal genetic homogeneity for SZ and DUD while older AAO had greater genetic homogeneity for MD with AUD falling in between.

Short-term exposure to antipsychotics has proven to be beneficial. However, naturalistic studies are lacking regarding the long-term use of antipsychotics. This study aimed to investigate changes in use of antipsychotics over 20 years after a first-episode schizophrenia. Methods. This study is part of the Danish OPUS trial (1998–2000), including 496 participants with first-episode schizophrenia. Participants were reassessed four times over 20 years. The main outcomes were days on medication, redeemed prescriptions of clozapine, psychiatric hospitalizations, and employment. Results. At the 20-year follow-up, an attrition of 71% was detected. In total, 143 out of 496 participated, with 36% (n = 51) in remission-of-psychotic-symptoms-off-medication. The lowest number of days on medication (mean [S.D.], 339 [538] days) was observed in this group over 20 years. Register data on redeemed antipsychotics were available for all trial participants (n = 416). Individuals in treatment with antipsychotics (n = 120) at the 20-year follow-up had spent significantly more days in treatment (5405 [1857] v. 1434 [1819] mean days, p = 0.00) and more had ever redeemed a prescription of clozapine (25% v. 7.8%, p = 0.00) than individuals who had discontinued antipsychotics (n = 296). Further, discontinuers had significantly higher employment at the 20-year follow-up (28.4% v. 12.5%, p = 0.00). Conclusion. In a cohort of individuals with first-episode schizophrenia, 36% were in remission-of-psychotic-symptoms-off-medication. However, high attrition was detected, potentially affecting study results by inflating results from individuals with favorable outcomes. From register data, free from attrition, approximately 30% were in treatment with antipsychotics, and 70% had discontinued antipsychotics. Individuals in treatment had the least favorable outcomes, implying greater illness severity. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Disability and pain intensity were outcomes re-assessed at a 6-month follow-up. The impact of pain resilience dimension scores and identified rGMV sites on follow-up outcomes was examined after controlling for other baseline correlates of outcomes. Mediating effects of identified rGMV sites on pain resilience dimension-follow-up outcome relations were also evaluated. Results Aside from the significant multivariate effect of lower behavioral perseverance and cognitive/affective positivity scores, augmented left precuneus, temporal pole, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and precentral gyrus rGMV combined to predict higher follow-up disability levels, independent of covariates. Higher left fusiform gyrus rGMV levels predicted follow-up exacerbations in pain intensity, but pain resilience dimension scores did not. Finally, left precuneus and left temporal pole STG rGMV partially mediated cognitive/affective positivity-follow-up disability relations. Conclusions Findings underscore deficits in pain resilience and increased rGMV as potential risk factors for poorer subsequent outcomes of chronic musculoskeletal pain and provide foundations for further prospective extensions as well as targeted intervention research.

The present secondary analysis (Zainal & Newman, 2023b) thus determined whether EF domains mediated the effect of a 14-day (5 prompts/day) mindfulness ecological momentary intervention (MEMI) against a self-monitoring control (SM) for GAD. Method Participants (N = 110) diagnosed with GAD completed self-reported (Attentional Control Scale, GAD Questionnaire, Perseverative Cognitions Questionnaire) and performance-based tests (Letter-Number Sequencing, Stroop, Trail Making Test-B, Verbal Fluency) at baseline, post-treatment, and one-month follow-up (1MFU). Causal mediation analyses determined if pre-post changes in EF domains preceded and mediated the effect of MEMI against SM on pre-1MFU changes in GAD severity and trait repetitive negative thinking (RNT). Results MEMI was more efficacious than SM in improving pre-post inhibition (β = -2.075, 95% [-3.388, -0.762], p =.002), working memory (β = 0.512, 95% [0.012, 1.011], p =.045), and set-shifting (β = -2.916, 95% [-5.142, -0.691], p =.010) but not verbal fluency and attentional control. Within groups, MEMI but not SM produced improvements in all examined pre-post EF outcomes except attentional control. Only pre-post improvements in inhibition mediated the effect of MEMI against SM on pre-1MFU reductions in GAD severity (β = -0.605, 95% [-1.357, -0.044], p =.030; proportion mediated = 7.1%) and trait RNT (β = -0.024, 95% [-0.054, -0.001], p =.040; proportion mediated = 7.4%). These patterns remained after conducting sensitivity analyses with non-linear mediator-outcome relations. Conclusions Optimizing MEMI for GAD might entail specifically boosting inhibition plausibly by augmenting it with dialectical behavioral therapy, encouraging high-intensity physical exercises, and targeting negative emotional contrast avoidance.

It has been hypothesised that this association arises because VRFs disconnect fronto-subcortical white matter tracts involved in mood regulation, which puts older adults at higher risk of developing depressive symptoms. However, evidence for the hypothesis that disconnection of white matter tracts underlies the association between VRF burden and depressive symptoms from longitudinal studies is scarce. Methods This preregistered study analysed longitudinal data from 6,964 middle-aged and older adults from the UK Biobank who participated in consecutive assessments of VRFs, brain imaging, and depressive symptoms. Using mediation modelling, we directly tested to what extend white matter microstructure mediates the longitudinal association between VRF burden and depressive symptoms. Results VRF burden showed a small association with depressive symptoms at follow-up. However, there was no evidence that fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter tracts mediated this association. Additional analyses also yielded no mediating effects using alternative operationalisations of VRF burden, mean diffusivity (MD) of single tracts, or overall average of tract-based white matter microstructure (global FA, global MD, white matter hyperintensity volume). Conclusions Our results lend no support to the hypothesis that disconnection of white matter tracts underlies the association between VRF burden and depressive symptoms, while highlighting the relevance of using longitudinal data to directly test pathways linking vascular and mental health. © The Author(s), 2023.

Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is beneficial for health, and reducing sedentary behavior (SB) is recommended in international guidelines. People with mental illnesses are at higher risk of preventable diseases than the general population, partly attributable to lower MVPA and higher SB. Self-determination theory provides a framework for understanding how motivation regulates behavior. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of different forms of motivation for physical activity (amotivation, controlled, autonomous) to MVPA and SB in people with mental illnesses. Methods. Cross-sectional self-reported and accelerometer-derived MVPA and SB in people with a range of mental illnesses across four countries were pooled for analysis (Australia, Belgium, England, Uganda). Motivation for physical activity was measured using the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ). Regression analyses were used to investigate the association of MVPA and SB with amotivation, controlled, autonomous motivations, controlling for mental health and demographic variables. Results. Autonomous motivation was associated with 31% higher self-reported MVPA, and amotivation and controlled motivation were associated with 18% and 11% lower self-reported MVPA, respectively (n = 654). In contrast, controlled motivation was positively associated with SB (n = 189). Having physical comorbidities or an alcohol use disorder was associated with lower MVPA (n = 318). Sub-analyses with accelerometer-derived MVPA and SB (n = 139 and n = 145) did not reveal any associations with motivational forms. Conclusions. Findings with an international sample support the universal relevance of motivation in promoting health-related behavior. Strategies for facilitating autonomous motivation should be utilized by health professionals seeking to support people with mental illnesses to become physically active. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Therefore, it remains uncertain what mechanisms underlie these associations. We assess the moderation of associations between maternal at-risk drinking and childhood emotional and behavioral problems by common genetic variants linked to environmental sensitivity (genotype-by-environment [G × E] interaction) while accounting for shared genetic risk between mothers and offspring (GE correlation). Methods We use data from 109 727 children born to 90 873 mothers enrolled in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study. Women self-reported alcohol consumption and reported emotional and behavioral problems when children were 1.5/3/5 years old. We included child polygenic scores (PGSs) for traits linked to environmental sensitivity as moderators. Results Associations between maternal drinking and child emotional (β1 = 0.04 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.05]) and behavioral (β1 = 0.07 [0.06-0.08]) outcomes attenuated after controlling for measured confounders and were almost zero when we accounted for unmeasured confounding (emotional: β1 = 0.01 [0.00-0.02]; behavioral: β1 = 0.01 [0.00-0.02]). We observed no moderation of these adjusted exposure effects by any of the PGS. Conclusions The lack of strong evidence for G × E interaction may indicate that the mechanism is not implicated in this kind of intergenerational association. It may also reflect insufficient power or the relatively benign nature of the exposure in this sample.  © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

In schizophrenia (SZ), impairments in cognitive functions, such as working memory, have been associated with alterations in certain types of inhibitory neurons that utilize the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). For example, GABA neurons that express parvalbumin (PV) or somatostatin (SST) have more prominent gene expression alterations than those that express vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In bipolar disorder (BD) and major depression (MD), which exhibit similar, but less severe, cognitive impairments than SZ, alterations of transcript levels in GABA neurons have also been reported. However, the extent to which GABA neuron subtype-selective transcripts in the DLPFC are affected, and the relative magnitudes of the diagnosis-associated effects, have not been directly compared across SZ, BD, and MD in the same study. Methods. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine levels of GABA neuron subtype-selective transcripts (PV, potassium voltage-gated channel modifier subfamily-S member-3, SST, VIP, and calretinin mRNAs), as well as the pan-GABA neuron marker 67 kDa glutamate decarboxylase mRNA, in DLPFC total gray matter of 160 individuals, including those with SZ, BD, or MD and unaffected comparison (UC) individuals. Results. Relative to UC individuals, individuals with SZ exhibited large deficits in levels of all transcripts except for calretinin mRNA, whereas individuals with BD or MD showed a marked deficit only for PV or SST mRNAs, respectively. Conclusions. These findings suggest that broader and more severe alterations in DLPFC GABA neurons might contribute to the greater cognitive impairments in SZ relative to BD and MD. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Our aim was to explore longer-term trends in mortality, including the COVID-19 pandemic period, with a focus on additional vulnerabilities (psychiatric comorbidities and race/ ethnicity) in SMI. Methods Retrospective cohort study using electronic health records from secondary mental healthcare, covering a UK region of 1.3 million people. Mortality trends spanning fourteen years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, were assessed in adults with clinician-ascribed ICD-10 diagnoses for schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar disorders. Results The sample comprised 22 361 people with SMI with median follow-up of 10.6 years. Standardized mortality ratios were more than double the population average pre-pandemic, increasing further during the pandemic, particularly in those with SMI and psychiatric comorbidities. Mortality risk increased steadily among people with SMI and comorbid depression, dementia, substance use disorders and anxiety over 13-years, increasing further during the pandemic. COVID-19 mortality was elevated in people with SMI and comorbid depression (sub-Hazard Ratio: 1.48 [95% CI 1.03-2.13]), dementia (sHR:1.96, 1.26-3.04) and learning disabilities (sHR:2.30, 1.30-4.06), compared to people with only SMI. COVID-19 mortality risk was similar for minority ethnic groups and White British people with SMI. Elevated all-cause mortality was evident in Black Caribbean (adjusted Rate Ratio: 1.40, 1.11-1.77) and Black African people with SMI (aRR: 1.59, 1.07-2.37) during the pandemic relative to earlier years. Conclusions Mortality has increased over time in people with SMI. The pandemic exacerbated pre-existing trends. Actionable solutions are needed which address wider social determinants and address disease silos.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Prior suicide attempts and SUDs are two of the most consistent predictors of suicide death, and clarifying the role of SUDs in the transition from suicide attempt to suicide death could inform prevention efforts. Methods We used national Swedish registry data to identify individuals born 1960-1985, with an index suicide attempt in 1997-2017 (N = 74 873; 46.7% female). We assessed risk of suicide death as a function of registration for a range of individual SUDs. We further examined whether the impact of SUDs varied as a function of (i) aggregate genetic liability to suicidal behavior, or (ii) age at index suicide attempt. Results In univariate models, risk of suicide death was higher among individuals with any SUD registration [hazard ratios (HRs) = 2.68-3.86]. In multivariate models, effects of specific SUDs were attenuated, but remained elevated for AUD (HR = 1.86 95% confidence intervals 1.68-2.05), opiates [HR = 1.58 (1.37-1.82)], sedatives [HR = 1.93 (1.70-2.18)], and multiple substances [HR = 2.09 (1.86-2.35)]. In secondary analyses, the effects of most, but not all, SUD were exacerbated by higher levels of genetic liability to suicide death, and among individuals who were younger at their index suicide attempt. Conclusions In the presence of a strong predictor of suicide death - a prior attempt - substantial predictive power is still attributable to SUDs. Individuals with SUDs may warrant additional suicide screening and prevention efforts, particularly in the context of a family history of suicidal behavior or early onset of suicide attempt. © The Author(s), 2022.

Cognitive impairment, a major determinant of poor functioning in schizophrenia, had limited responses to existing antipsychotic drugs. The limited efficacy could be due to regional differences in the dysregulation of the dopamine system. This study investigated striatal and peripheral dopaminergic makers in schizophrenia and their relationship with cognitive impairment. Methods. Thirty-three patients with schizophrenia and 36 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) participated. We evaluated their cognitive performance, examined the availability of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) using single-photon emission computed tomography with 99mTc-TRODAT, and measured plasma levels of dopaminergic precursors (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and three branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) that compete with precursors for brain uptake via ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Results. Schizophrenia patients exhibited lower cognitive performance, decreased striatal DAT availability, and reduced levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, and isoleucine, and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA. Within the patient group, lower DAT availability in the left caudate nucleus (CN) or putamen was positively associated with attention deficits. Meanwhile, lower tyrosine levels and the ratio of phenylalanine plus tyrosine to BCAA were positively related to executive dysfunction. Among all participants, DAT availability in the right CN or putamen was positively related to memory function, and plasma phenylalanine level was positively associated with executive function. Conclusions. This study supports the role of dopamine system abnormalities in cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. The distinct associations between different dopaminergic alterations and specific cognitive domain impairments suggest the potential need for multifaceted treatment approaches to target these impairments. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

We carried out the first large-scale, cross-national study to explore the implications of removing this excessiveness requirement. Methods Data come from the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey Initiative. A total of 133 614 adults from 12 surveys in Low- or Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) and 16 surveys in High-Income Countries (HICs) were assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Non-excessive worriers meeting all other DSM-5 criteria for GAD were compared to respondents meeting all criteria for GAD, and to respondents without GAD, on clinically-relevant correlates. Results Removing the excessiveness requirement increases the global lifetime prevalence of GAD from 2.6% to 4.0%, with larger increases in LMICs than HICs. Non-excessive and excessive GAD cases worry about many of the same things, although non-excessive cases worry more about health/welfare of loved ones, and less about personal or non-specific concerns, than excessive cases. Non-excessive cases closely resemble excessive cases in socio-demographic characteristics, family history of GAD, and risk of temporally secondary comorbidity and suicidality. Although non-excessive cases are less severe on average, they report impairment comparable to excessive cases and often seek treatment for GAD symptoms. Conclusions Individuals with non-excessive worry who meet all other DSM-5 criteria for GAD are clinically significant cases. Eliminating the excessiveness requirement would lead to a more defensible GAD diagnosis.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Cannabis use and familial vulnerability to psychosis have been associated with social cognition deficits. This study examined the potential relationship between cannabis use and cognitive biases underlying social cognition and functioning in patients with first episode psychosis (FEP), their siblings, and controls. Methods. We analyzed a sample of 543 participants with FEP, 203 siblings, and 1168 controls from the EU-GEI study using a correlational design. We used logistic regression analyses to examine the influence of clinical group, lifetime cannabis use frequency, and potency of cannabis use on cognitive biases, accounting for demographic and cognitive variables. Results. FEP patients showed increased odds of facial recognition processing (FRP) deficits (OR = 1.642, CI 1.123–2.402) relative to controls but not of speech illusions (SI) or jumping to conclusions (JTC) bias, with no statistically significant differences relative to siblings. Daily and occasional lifetime cannabis use were associated with decreased odds of SI (OR = 0.605, CI 0.368–0.997 and OR = 0.646, CI 0.457–0.913 respectively) and JTC bias (OR = 0.625, CI 0.422–0.925 and OR = 0.602, CI 0.460–0.787 respectively) compared with lifetime abstinence, but not with FRP deficits, in the whole sample. Within the cannabis user group, low-potency cannabis use was associated with increased odds of SI (OR = 1.829, CI 1.297–2.578, FRP deficits (OR = 1.393, CI 1.031–1.882, and JTC (OR = 1.661, CI 1.271–2.171) relative to high-potency cannabis use, with comparable effects in the three clinical groups. Conclusions. Our findings suggest increased odds of cognitive biases in FEP patients who have never used cannabis and in low-potency users. Future studies should elucidate this association and its potential implications. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

The goal of the current study was to redress this gap by investigating the moderating effects of harm due to substance use on pathways involving positive psychotic symptoms, the perceived cognitive-emotional sequelae of those symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Method The design was cross-sectional. Mediation and moderated mediation pathways were tested. The predictor was severity of positive psychotic symptoms. Cognitive interpretative and emotional characteristics of both auditory hallucinations and delusions were mediators. Suicidal ideation was the outcome variable. General symptoms associated with severe mental health problems were statistically controlled for. Results There was evidence of an indirect pathway between positive psychotic symptom severity and suicidal ideation via cognitive interpretation and emotional characteristics of both auditory hallucinations and delusions. Harm due to drug use, but not alcohol use, moderated the indirect pathway involving delusions such that it was most prominent when harm due to drug use was at medium-to-high levels. The components of suicidal ideation that were most strongly affected by this moderated indirect pathway were active intent, passive desire, and lack of deterrents. Conclusions From both scientific and therapy development perspectives, it is important to understand the complex interplay between, not only the presence of auditory hallucinations and delusions, but the ensuing cognitive and emotional consequences of those experiences which, when combined with harm associated with substance use, in particular drug use, can escalate suicidal thoughts and acts.

With an instrumental learning task, the aim of the current study is to investigate the extent to which learning behavior deviates from that observed in healthy adolescent controls and track the underlying mechanistic channel for such a deviation. Methods We recruited a group of adolescents with major depression and age-matched healthy control subjects to carry out the learning task with either gain or loss outcome and applied a reinforcement learning model that dissociates valence (positive v. negative) of reward prediction error and selection (chosen v. unchosen). Results The results demonstrated that adolescent depressive patients performed significantly less well than the control group. Learning rates suggested that the optimistic bias that overall characterizes healthy adolescent subjects was absent for the depressive adolescent patients. Moreover, depressed adolescents exhibited an increased pessimistic bias for the counterfactual outcome. Lastly, individual difference analysis suggested that these observed biases, which significantly deviated from that observed in normal controls, were linked with the severity of depressive symoptoms as measured by HAMD scores. Conclusions By leveraging an incentivized instrumental learning task with computational modeling within a reinforcement learning framework, the current study reveals a mechanistic decision-making deficit in adolescent depressive disorder. These findings, which have implications for the identification of behavioral markers in depression, could support the clinical evaluation, including both diagnosis and prognosis of this disorder. © The Author(s), 2023.

Major psychiatric disorders (MPDs) are delineated by distinct clinical features. However, overlapping symptoms and transdiagnostic effectiveness of medications have challenged the traditional diagnostic categorisation. We investigate if there are shared and illness-specific disruptions in the regional functional efficiency (RFE) of the brain across these disorders. Methods. We included 364 participants (118 schizophrenia [SCZ], 80 bipolar disorder [BD], 91 major depressive disorder [MDD], and 75 healthy controls [HCs]). Resting-state fMRI was used to caclulate the RFE based on the static amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity, and degree centrality and corresponding dynamic measures indicating variability over time. We used principal component analysis to obtain static and dynamic RFE values. We conducted functional and genetic annotation and enrichment analysis based on abnormal RFE profiles. Results. SCZ showed higher static RFE in the cortico-striatal regions and excessive variability in the cortico-limbic regions. SCZ and MDD shared lower static RFE with higher dynamic RFE in sensorimotor regions than BD and HCs. We observed association between static RFE abnormalities with reward and sensorimotor functions and dynamic RFE abnormalities with sensorimotor functions. Differential spatial expression of genes related to glutamatergic synapse and calcium/cAMP signaling was more likely in the regions with aberrant RFE. Conclusions. SCZ shares more regions with disrupted functional integrity, especially in sensorimotor regions, with MDD rather than BD. The neural patterns of these transdiagnostic changes appear to be potentially driven by gene expression variations relating to glutamatergic synapses and calcium/cAMP signaling. The aberrant sensorimotor, cortico-striatal, and cortico-limbic integrity may collectively underlie neurobiological mechanisms of MPDs. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Affective responses to the menstrual cycle vary widely. Some individuals experience severe symptoms like those with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, while others have minimal changes. The reasons for these differences are unclear, but prior studies suggest stressor exposure may play a role. However, research in at-risk psychiatric samples is lacking. Methods. In a large clinical sample, we conducted a prospective study of how lifetime stressors relate to degree of affective change across the cycle. 114 outpatients with past-month suicidal ideation (SI) provided daily ratings (n = 6187) of negative affect and SI across 1-3 menstrual cycles. Participants completed the Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN), which measures different stressor exposures (i.e. interpersonal loss, physical danger) throughout the life course, including before and after menarche. Multilevel polynomial growth models tested the relationship between menstrual cycle time and symptoms, moderated by stressor exposure. Results. Greater lifetime stressor exposure predicted a more pronounced perimenstrual increase in active SI, along with marginally significant similar patterns for negative affect and passive SI. Additionally, pre-menarche stressors significantly increased the cyclicity of active SI compared to post-menarche stressors. Exposure to more interpersonal loss stressors predicted greater perimenstrual symptom change of negative affect, passive SI and active SI. Exploratory item-level analyses showed that lifetime stressors moderated a more severe perimenstrual symptom trajectory for mood swings, anger/irritability, rejection sensitivity, and interpersonal conflict. Conclusion. These findings suggest that greater lifetime stressor exposure may lead to heightened emotional reactivity to ovarian hormone fluctuations, elevating the risk of psychopathology. © The Author(s), 2024.

Mental disorders and physical-health conditions frequently co-occur, impacting treatment outcomes. While most prior research has focused on single pairs of mental disorders and physical-health conditions, this study explores broader associations between multiple mental disorders and physical-health conditions. Methods. Using the Norwegian primary-care register, this population-based cohort study encompassed all 2 203 553 patients born in Norway from January 1945 through December 1984, who were full-time residents from January 2006 until December 2019 (14 years; 363 million person-months). Associations between seven mental disorders (sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, acute stress reaction, substance-use disorders, phobia/compulsive disorder, psychosis) and 16 physical-health conditions were examined, diagnosed according to the International Classification of Primary Care. Results. Of 112 mental-disorder/physical-health condition pairs, 96% of associations yielded positive and significant ORs, averaging 1.41 and ranging from 1.05 (99.99% CI 1.00–1.09) to 2.38 (99.99% CI 2.30–2.46). Across 14 years, every mental disorder was associated with multiple different physical-health conditions. Across 363 million person-months, having any mental disorder was associated with increased subsequent risk of all physical-health conditions (HRs:1.40 [99.99% CI 1.35–1.45] to 2.85 [99.99% CI 2.81–2.89]) and vice versa (HRs:1.56 [99.99% CI 1.54–1.59] to 3.56 [99.99% CI 3.54–3.58]). Associations were observed in both sexes, across age groups, and among patients with and without university education. Conclusions. The breadth of associations between virtually every mental disorder and physical-health condition among patients treated in primary care underscores a need for integrated mental and physical healthcare policy and practice.

ELS, particularly neglect, has been associated with reduced responsivity to reward. However, little work has investigated the computational specifics of this disrupted reward response-particularly with respect to the neural response to Reward Prediction Errors (RPE)-a critical signal for successful instrumental learning-and the extent to which they are augmented to novel stimuli. The goal of the current study was to investigate the associations of abuse and neglect, and neural representation of RPE to novel and non-novel stimuli. Methods One hundred and seventy-eight participants (aged 10-18, M = 14.9, s.d. = 2.38) engaged in the Novelty task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. In this task, participants learn to choose novel or non-novel stimuli to win monetary rewards varying from $0 to $0.30 per trial. Levels of abuse and neglect were measured using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Results Adolescents exposed to high levels of neglect showed reduced RPE-modulated blood oxygenation level dependent response within medial and lateral frontal cortices particularly when exploring novel stimuli (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) relative to adolescents exposed to lower levels of neglect. Conclusions These data expand on previous work by indicating that neglect, but not abuse, is associated with impairments in neural RPE representation within medial and lateral frontal cortices. However, there was no association between neglect and behavioral impairments on the Novelty task, suggesting that these neural differences do not necessarily translate into behavioral differences within the context of the Novelty task.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

This study aims to measure the extent of inequity in eating disorder-related healthcare utilization, analyze trends, and explore the sources of inequalities using New South Wales (NSW) administrative linked health data for 2005 to 2020. Methods Socioeconomic inequities were measured using concentration index approach, and decomposition analysis was conducted to explain the factors accounting for inequality. Healthcare utilization included: public inpatient admissions, private inpatient admissions, visits to public mental health outpatient clinics and emergency department visits, with three different measures (probability of visit, total and conditional number of visits) for each outcome. Results Private hospital admissions due to eating disorders were concentrated among individuals from higher socioeconomic status (SES) from 2005 to 2020. There was no significant inequity in the probability of public hospital admissions for the same period. Public outpatient visits were utilized more by people from lower SES from 2008 to 2020. Emergency department visits were equitable, but more utilized by those from lower SES in 2020. Conclusions Public hospital and emergency department services were equitably used by people with eating disorders in NSW, but individuals from high SES were more likely to be admitted to private hospitals for eating disorder care. Use of public hospital outpatient services was higher for those from lower SES. These findings can assist policymakers in understanding the equity of the healthcare system and developing programs to improve fairness in eating disorder-related healthcare in NSW.

However, results are inconsistent and may represent correlational rather than causal relationships. The present study investigated whether maternal coffee consumption was observationally associated and causally related to offspring childhood neurodevelopmental difficulties (NDs) in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study. Methods The observational relationships between maternal/paternal coffee consumption (before and during pregnancy) and offspring NDs were assessed using linear regression analyses (N = 58694 mother-child duos; N = 22 576 father-child duos). To investigate potential causal relationships, individual-level (N = 46 245 mother-child duos) and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted using genetic variants previously associated with coffee consumption as instrumental variables. Results We observed positive associations between maternal coffee consumption and offspring difficulties with social-communication/behavioral flexibility, and inattention/hyperactive-impulsive behavior (multiple testing corrected p < 0.005). Paternal coffee consumption (negative control) was not observationally associated with the outcomes. After adjusting for potential confounders (smoking, alcohol, education and income), the maternal associations attenuated to the null. MR analyses suggested that increased maternal coffee consumption was causally associated with social-communication difficulties (individual-level: beta = 0.128, se = 0.043, p = 0.003; two-sample: beta = 0.348, se = 0.141, p = 0.010). However, individual-level MR analyses that modelled potential pleiotropic pathways found the effect diminished (beta = 0.088, se = 0.049, p = 0.071). Individual-level MR analyses yielded similar estimates (heterogeneity p = 0.619) for the causal effect of coffee consumption on social communication difficulties in maternal coffee consumers (beta = 0.153, se = 0.071, p = 0.032) and non-consumers (beta = 0.107, se = 0.134, p = 0.424). Conclusions Together, our results provide little evidence for a causal effect of maternal coffee consumption on offspring NDs.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

Unpredictability is a core but understudied dimension of adversities and has been receiving increasing attention recently. The effects of unpredictability on psychopathology and the underlying neural mechanisms, however, remain unclear. It is also unknown how unpredictability interacts with other dimensions of adversities in predicting brain development and psychopathology of youth. Methods. We applied cluster robust standard errors to examine how unpredictability was associated with the developmental changes in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of large-scale brain networks implicated in psychopathology, as well as the moderating role of deprivation, using data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, which included four measurements from baseline (mean ± S.D. age, 119.13 ± 7.51 months; 2815 females) to 3-year follow-up (N = 5885). Results. After controlling for threat, unpredictability was associated with a smaller increase in rsFC within default mode network (DMN) and a smaller decrease in rsFC between cingulo-opercular network (CON) and DMN. Neighborhood educational deprivation moderated the associations between unpredictability and changes in rsFC within DMN and fronto-parietal network (FPN), as well as between CON and DMN. A smaller decrease in rsFC between CON and DMN mediated the association between unpredictability and externalizing problems. Neighborhood educational deprivation moderated the indirect pathway from unpredictability to externalizing problems via a smaller decrease in CON-DMN rsFC. Conclusions. Our findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying the associations between unpredictability and adolescents’ psychopathology and the moderating role of deprivation, highlighting the significance of providing stable environment and abundant educational opportunities to facilitate optimal development. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

A pre-registered systematic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and Neurobite was performed from inception to May 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which examined the efficacy of cognitive and behavioral interventions in treating depression and/or anxiety among adults with neurological disorders were included. Estimates were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed on categorical and continuous moderators, respectively. Main outcomes were pre- and post-intervention depression and anxiety symptom scores, as reported using standardized measures. Fifty-four RCTs involving 5372 participants with 11 neurological disorders (including multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, stroke) were included. The overall effect of interventions yielded significant improvements in both depression (57 arms, Hedges' g = 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-0.54) and anxiety symptoms (29 arms, g = 0.38, 95% CI 0.29-0.48), compared to controls. Efficacy was greater in studies which employed a minimum baseline symptom severity inclusion criterion for both outcomes, and greater in trials using inactive controls for depression only. There was also evidence of differential efficacy of interventions across the neurological disorder types and the outcome measure used. Risk of bias, intervention delivery mode, intervention tailoring for neurological disorders, sample size, and study year did not moderate effects. Cognitive and behavioral interventions yield small-to-moderate improvements in symptoms of both depression and anxiety in adults with a range of neurological disorders.

A recent study performed a 'genome-wide association study (GWAS) by subtraction,' subtracting genetic effects for cognitive performance from an educational attainment GWAS to create orthogonal 'cognitive' and 'non-cognitive' factors. These cognitive and non-cognitive factors showed associations with behavioral health outcomes in adults; however, whether these correlations are present during childhood is unclear. Methods Using data from up to 5517 youth (ages 9-11) of European ancestry from the ongoing Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study, we examined associations between polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive and non-cognitive factors and cognition, risk tolerance, decision-making & personality, substance initiation, psychopathology, and brain structure (e.g. volume, fractional anisotropy [FA]). Within-sibling analyses estimated whether observed genetic associations may be consistent with direct genetic effects. Results Both PGSs were associated with greater cognition and lower impulsivity, drive, and severity of psychotic-like experiences. The cognitive PGS was also associated with greater risk tolerance, increased odds of choosing delayed reward, and decreased likelihood of ADHD and bipolar disorder; the non-cognitive PGS was associated with lack of perseverance and reward responsiveness. Cognitive PGS were more strongly associated with larger regional cortical volumes; non-cognitive PGS were more strongly associated with higher FA. All associations were characterized by small effects. Conclusions While the small sizes of these associations suggest that they are not effective for prediction within individuals, cognitive and non-cognitive PGS show unique associations with phenotypes in childhood at the population level.

In this retrospective population-based study, we aimed to examine the association of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with depressive symptoms, distinguishing self-reported v. biologically confirmed COVID-19. Methods 32 007 participants from the SAPRIS survey nested in the French CONSTANCES cohort were included. COVID-19 was measured as followed: ad hoc serologic testing, self-reported PCR or serology positive test results, and self-reported COVID-19. Depressive symptoms were measured with the Center of Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Outcomes were depressive symptoms (total CES-D score, its four dimensions, and clinically significant depressive symptoms) and exposure was prior COVID-19 (no COVID-19/self-reported unconfirmed COVID-19/biologically confirmed COVID-19). Results In comparison to participants without COVID-19, participants with self-reported unconfirmed COVID-19 and biologically confirmed COVID-19 had higher CES-D scores (β for one interquartile range increase [95% CI]: 0.15 [0.08-0.22] and 0.09 [0.05-0.13], respectively) and somatic complaints dimension scores (0.15 [0.09-0.21] and 0.10 [0.07-0.13]). Only those with self-reported but unconfirmed COVID-19 had higher depressed affect dimension scores (0.08 [0.01-0.14]). Accounting for ad hoc serologic testing only, the CES-D score and the somatic complaints dimension were only associated with the combination of self-reported COVID-19 and negative serology test results. Conclusions The association between COVID-19 and depressive symptoms was merely driven by somatic symptoms of depression and did not follow a gradient consistent with the hypothesis of a direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the risk of depression.

The hippocampal formation represents a key region in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Aerobic exercise poses a promising add-on treatment to potentially counteract structural impairments of the hippocampal formation and associated symptomatic burden. However, current evidence regarding exercise effects on the hippocampal formation in schizophrenia is largely heterogeneous. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of aerobic exercise on total hippocampal formation volume. Additionally, we used data from a recent multicenter randomized-controlled trial to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on hippocampal formation subfield volumes and their respective clinical implications.

The meta-analysis comprised six studies that investigated the influence of aerobic exercise on total hippocampal formation volume compared to a control condition with a total of 186 people with schizophrenia (100 male, 86 female), while original data from 29 patients (20 male, 9 female) was considered to explore effects of six months of aerobic exercise on hippocampal formation subfield volumes. Results. Our meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant effect of aerobic exercise on total hippocampal formation volume in people with schizophrenia (g = 0.33 [−0.12 to 0.77]), p = 0.15), but our original data suggested significant volume increases in certain hippocampal subfields, namely the cornu ammonis and dentate gyrus. Conclusions. Driven by the necessity of better understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the present work underlines the importance to focus on hippocampal formation subfields and to characterize subgroups of patients that show neuroplastic responses to aerobic exercise accompanied by corresponding clinical improvements. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Psychotic symptoms in adolescence are associated with social adversity and genetic risk for schizophrenia. This gene–environment interplay may be mediated by personality, which also develops during adolescence. We hypothesized that (i) personality development predicts later Psychosis Proneness Signs (PPS), and (ii) personality traits mediate the association between genetic risk for schizophrenia, social adversities, and psychosis. Methods. A total of 784 individuals were selected within the IMAGEN cohort (Discovery Sample-DS: 526; Validation Sample-VS: 258); personality was assessed at baseline (13–15 years), follow-up-1 (FU1, 16–17 years), and FU2 (18–20 years). Latent growth curve models served to compute coefficients of individual change across 14 personality variables. A support vector machine algorithm employed these coefficients to predict PPS at FU3 (21–24 years). We computed mediation analyses, including personality-based predictions and self-reported bullying victimization as serial mediators along the pathway between polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia and FU3 PPS. We replicated the main findings also on 1132 adolescents recruited within the TRAILS cohort. Results. Growth scores in neuroticism and openness predicted PPS with 65.6% balanced accuracy in the DS, and 69.5% in the VS Mediations revealed a significant positive direct effect of PRS on PPS (confidence interval [CI] 0.01–0.15), and an indirect effect, serially mediated by personality-based predictions and victimization (CI 0.006–0.01), replicated in the TRAILS cohort (CI 0.0004–0.004). Conclusions. Adolescent personality changes may predate future experiences associated with psychosis susceptibility. PPS personality-based predictions mediate the relationship between PRS and victimization toward adult PPS, suggesting that gene–environment correlations proposed for psychosis are partly mediated by personality. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Executive control over low-level information processing is impaired proximal to psychosis onset with evidence of recovery over the first year of illness. However, previous studies demonstrating diminished perceptual modulation via attention are complicated by simultaneously impaired perceptual responses. The present study examined the early auditory gamma-band response (EAGBR), a marker of early cortical processing that appears preserved in first-episode psychosis (FEP), and its modulation by attention in a longitudinal FEP sample. Methods. Magnetoencephalography was recorded from 25 FEP and 32 healthy controls (HC) during active and passive listening conditions in an auditory oddball task at baseline and follow-up (4–12 months) sessions. EAGBR inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and evoked power were measured from responses to standard tones. Symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results. There was no group difference in EAGBR power or ITPC. While EAGBR ITPC increased with attention in HC, this modulation was impaired among FEP. Diminished EAGBR modulation in FEP persisted at longitudinal follow-up. However, among FEP, recovery of EAGBR modulation was associated with reduced PANSS negative scores. Conclusion. FEP exhibit impaired executive control over the flow of information at the earliest stages of sensory processing within auditory cortex. In contrast to previous work, this deficit was observed despite an intact measure of sensory processing, mitigating potential confounds. Recovery of sensory gain modulation over time was associated with reductions in negative symptoms, highlighting a source of potential resiliency against some of the most debilitating and treatment refractory symptoms in early psychosis. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Glutamate (Glu) and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the brain's primary excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, play critical roles in brain function and physiological processes. Methods We examined the levels of Glu, combined glutamate and glutamine (Glx), and GABA across psychiatric disorders by pooling data from 121 1H-MRS studies and further divided the sample based on Axis I disorders. Results Statistically significant differences in GABA levels were found in the combined psychiatric group compared with healthy controls (Hedge's g =-0.112, p = 0.008). Further analyses based on brain regions showed that brain GABA levels significantly differed across Axis I disorders and controls in the parieto-occipital cortex (Hedge's g = 0.277, p = 0.019). Furthermore, GABA levels were reduced in affective disorders in the occipital cortex (Hedge's g =-0.468, p = 0.043). Reductions in Glx levels were found in neurodevelopmental disorders (Hedge's g =-0.287, p = 0.022). Analysis focusing on brain regions suggested that Glx levels decreased in the frontal cortex (Hedge's g =-0.226, p = 0.025), and the reduction of Glu levels in patients with affective disorders in the frontal cortex is marginally significant (Hedge's g =-0.172, p = 0.052). When analyzing the anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex separately, reductions were only found in GABA levels in the former (Hedge's g =-0.191, p = 0.009) across all disorders. Conclusions Altered glutamatergic and GABAergic metabolites were found across psychiatric disorders, indicating shared dysfunction. We found reduced GABA levels across psychiatric disorders and lower Glu levels in affective disorders. These results highlight the significance of GABA and Glu in psychiatric etiology and partially support rethinking current diagnostic categories.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

We evaluated the effectiveness and costs of KiVa, a whole-school anti-bullying programme that targets the peer context. Methods A two-arm pragmatic multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial with embedded economic evaluation. Schools were randomised to KiVa-intervention or usual practice (UP), stratified on school size and Free School Meals eligibility. KiVa was delivered by trained teachers across one school year. Follow-up was at 12 months post randomisation. Primary outcome: student-reported bullying-victimization; secondary outcomes: self-reported bullying-perpetration, participant roles in bullying, empathy and teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Outcomes were analysed using multilevel linear and logistic regression models. Findings Between 8/11/2019 – 12/02/2021, 118 primary schools were recruited in four trial sites, 11,111 students in primary analysis (KiVa-intervention: n=5,944; 49.6% female; UP: n=5,167, 49.0% female). At baseline, 21·6% of students reported being bullied in the UP group and 20.3% in the KiVa-intervention group, reducing to 20.7% in the UP group and 17.7% in the KiVa-intervention group at follow-up (odds ratio 0.87; 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.97, p-value=0.009). Students in the KiVa group had significantly higher empathy and reduced peer problems. We found no differences in bullying perpetration, school wellbeing, emotional or behavioural problems. A priori subgroup analyses revealed no differences in effectiveness by socioeconomic gradient, or by gender. KiVa costs £20.78 more per pupil than usual practice in the first year, and £1.65 more per pupil in subsequent years. Interpretation The KiVa anti-bullying programme is effective at reducing bullying victimisation with small-moderate effects of public health importance.

Individual participant data (IPD) meta-Analyses can provide more precise effect estimates than conventional meta-Analyses. This IPD meta-Analysis compared the efficacy of IPT and antidepressants on various outcomes at post-Treatment and follow-up (PROSPERO: CRD42020219891). A systematic literature search conducted May 1st, 2023 identified randomized trials comparing IPT and antidepressants in acute-phase treatment of adults with depression. Anonymized IPD were requested and analyzed using mixed-effects models. The prespecified primary outcome was post-Treatment depression symptom severity. Secondary outcomes were all post-Treatment and follow-up measures assessed in at least two studies. IPD were obtained from 9 of 15 studies identified (N = 1536/1948, 78.9%). No significant comparative treatment effects were found on post-Treatment measures of depression (d = 0.088, p = 0.103, N = 1530) and social functioning (d = 0.026, p = 0.624, N = 1213). In smaller samples, antidepressants performed slightly better than IPT on post-Treatment measures of general psychopathology (d = 0.276, p = 0.023, N = 307) and dysfunctional attitudes (d = 0.249, p = 0.029, N = 231), but not on any other secondary outcomes, nor at follow-up. This IPD meta-Analysis is the first to examine the acute and longer-Term efficacy of IPT v. antidepressants on a broad range of outcomes. Depression treatment trials should routinely include multiple outcome measures and follow-up assessments.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Adolescents with a history of conduct problems (CP) are at heightened risk of increased service utilization as they develop. While the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear, early CP have also been linked with peer victimization and internalizing problems. The goals of the current study were: (1) to examine peer victimization and internalizing problems as potential serial mediators explaining increased medical and psychiatric service use in adolescents with a history of childhood CP, and; (2) to explore whether the proposed mediation models vary by sex. Methods. Participants (N = 744; 53% boys, Mage = 8.39 years) from an ongoing longitudinal study that began in 2008 in Québec, Canada were recruited and assessed for CP, service use, and other behaviours via self-, parent- and teacher-reported questionnaires. Serial mediation analyses were conducted to examine the effects of peer victimization and internalizing problems on the association between childhood CP and adolescent medical and psychiatric service use, controlling for sex and household income. Results. Adolescents with childhood CP reported higher medical and psychiatric service use than non-CP peers. Peer victimization and internalizing problems significantly mediated this association in both general medical and psychiatric service use models. The models did not vary by sex. Conclusions. Findings support higher levels of service use in adolescents with a history of CP, mediated by peer victimization and internalizing problems. Specifically, results highlight the importance of examining peer and socioemotional factors that may explain the increased service usage observed among youth with CP, to support better health outcomes. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Past studies indicate daily increases in estrogen across the menstrual cycle protect against binge-eating (BE) phenotypes (e.g. emotional eating), whereas increases in progesterone enhance risk. Two previous studies from our laboratory suggest these associations could be due to differential genomic effects of estrogen and progesterone. However, these prior studies were unable to directly model effects of daily changes in hormones on etiologic risk, instead relying on menstrual cycle phase or mean hormone levels. The current study used newly modified twin models to examine, for the first time, the effects of daily changes in estradiol and progesterone on genetic/environmental influences on emotional eating in our archival twin sample assessed across 45 consecutive days. Methods. Participants included 468 female twins from the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Daily emotional eating was assessed with the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, and daily saliva samples were assayed for ovarian hormone levels. Modified genotype × environment interaction models examined daily changes in genetic/environmental effects across hormone levels. Results. Findings revealed differential effects of daily changes in hormones on etiologic risk, with increasing genetic influences across progesterone levels, and increasing shared environmental influences at the highest estradiol levels. Results were consistent across primary analyses examining all study days and sensitivity analyses within menstrual cycle phases. Conclusions. Findings are significant in being the first to identify changes in etiologic risk for BE symptoms across daily hormone levels and highlighting novel mechanisms (e.g. hormone threshold effects, regulation of conserved genes) that may contribute to the etiology of BE. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder allow for heterogeneous symptom profiles but genetic analysis of major depressive symptoms has the potential to identify clinical and etiological subtypes. There are several challenges to integrating symptom data from genetically informative cohorts, such as sample size differences between clinical and community cohorts and various patterns of missing data. Methods. We conducted genome-wide association studies of major depressive symptoms in three cohorts that were enriched for participants with a diagnosis of depression (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, Australian Genetics of Depression Study, Generation Scotland) and three community cohorts who were not recruited on the basis of diagnosis (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, Estonian Biobank, and UK Biobank). We fit a series of confirmatory factor models with factors that accounted for how symptom data was sampled and then compared alternative models with different symptom factors. Results. The best fitting model had a distinct factor for Appetite/Weight symptoms and an additional measurement factor that accounted for the skip-structure in community cohorts (use of Depression and Anhedonia as gating symptoms). Conclusion. The results show the importance of assessing the directionality of symptoms (such as hypersomnia versus insomnia) and of accounting for study and measurement design when meta-analyzing genetic association data. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

It may be possible to 'enrich' UHR cohorts based on the environmental characteristics seen more commonly in first-episode psychosis cohorts. This study aimed to determine whether transition rates varied according to the accumulated exposure to environmental risk factors at the individual (migrant status, asylum seeker/refugee status, indigenous population, cannabis/methamphetamine use), family (family history or parental separation), and neighborhood (population density, social deprivation, and fragmentation) level. Methods The study included UHR people aged 15-24 who attended the PACE clinic from 2012 to 2016. Cox proportional hazards models (frequentist and Bayesian) were used to assess the association between individual and accumulated factors and transition to psychosis. UHR status and transition was determined using the CAARMS. Benjamini-Hochberg was used to correct for multiple comparisons in frequentist analyses. Results Of the 461 young people included, 55.5% were female and median follow-up was 307 days (IQR: 188-557) and 17.6% (n = 81) transitioned to a psychotic disorder. The proportion who transitioned increased incrementally according to the number of individual-level risk factors present (HR = 1.51, 95% CIs 1.19-1.93, p < 0.001, pcorr = 0.01). The number of family- and neighborhood-level exposures did not increase transition risk (p > 0.05). Cannabis use was the only specific risk factor significantly associated with transition (HR = 1.89, 95% CIs 1.22-2.93, pcorr = 0.03, BF = 6.74). Conclusions There is a dose-response relationship between exposure to individual-level psychosis-related environmental risk factors and transition risk in UHR patients. If replicated, this could be incorporated into a novel approach to identifying the highest-risk individuals within clinical services.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Early detection of potential future resistance would improve prognosis by reducing the delay to appropriate treatment adjustment and recovery. Here, we sought to determine whether neurodevelopmental markers can predict therapeutic response. Methods Healthy controls (N = 236), patients with schizophrenia (N = 280) or bipolar disorder (N = 78) with a known therapeutic outcome, were retrospectively included. Age, sex, education, early developmental abnormalities (obstetric complications, height, weight, and head circumference at birth, hyperactivity, dyslexia, epilepsy, enuresis, encopresis), neurological soft signs (NSS), and ages at first subjective impairment, clinical symptoms, treatment, and hospitalization, were recorded. A supervised algorithm leveraged NSS and age at first clinical signs to classify between resistance and response in schizophrenia. Results Developmental abnormalities were more frequent in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder than in controls. NSS significantly differed between controls, responsive, and resistant participants with schizophrenia (5.5 ± 3.0, 7.0 ± 4.0, 15.0 ± 6.0 respectively, p = 3 × 10-10) and bipolar disorder (5.5 ± 3.0, 8.3 ± 3.0, 12.5 ± 6.0 respectively, p < 1 × 10-10). In schizophrenia, but not in bipolar disorder, age at first subjective impairment was three years lower, and age at first clinical signs two years lower, in resistant than responsive subjects (p = 2 × 10-4 and p = 9 × 10-3, respectively). Age at first clinical signs and NSS accurately predicted treatment response in schizophrenia (area-under-curve: 77 ± 8%, p = 1 × 10-14). Conclusions Neurodevelopmental features such as NSS and age of clinical onset provide a means to identify patients who may require rapid treatment adaptation.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Methods 935 participants completed an online reinforcement learning task involving choices between pairs of symbols with differing reward contingencies. Half (49.1%) of the sample was randomised to a cognitive self-distancing intervention and were trained to regulate or 'take a step back' from their emotional response to feedback throughout. Established computational (Q-learning) models were then fit to individuals' choices to derive reinforcement learning parameters capturing clarity of choice values (inverse temperature) and their sensitivity to positive and negative feedback (learning rates). Results Cognitive distancing improved task performance, including when participants were later tested on novel combinations of symbols without feedback. Group differences in computational model-derived parameters revealed that cognitive distancing resulted in clearer representations of option values (estimated 0.17 higher inverse temperatures). Simultaneously, distancing caused increased sensitivity to negative feedback (estimated 19% higher loss learning rates). Exploratory analyses suggested this resulted from an evolving shift in strategy by distanced participants: initially, choices were more determined by expected value differences between symbols, but as the task progressed, they became more sensitive to negative feedback, with evidence for a difference strongest by the end of training. Conclusions Adaptive effects on the computations that underlie learning from reward and loss may explain the therapeutic benefits of cognitive distancing. Over time and with practice, cognitive distancing may improve symptoms of mental health disorders by promoting more effective engagement with negative information.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

It is unclear whether problems persist after PTSD symptoms remit. Methods Data came from 12 270 trauma-exposed women in the Nurses' Health Study II. Trauma and PTSD symptoms were assessed using validated scales to determine PTSD status as of 2008 (trauma/no PTSD, remitted PTSD, unresolved PTSD) and symptom severity (lifetime and past-month). Starting in 2014, cognitive function was assessed using the Cogstate Brief Battery every 6 or 12 months for up to 24 months. PTSD associations with baseline cognition and longitudinal cognitive changes were estimated by covariate-adjusted linear regression and linear mixed-effects models, respectively. Results Compared to women with trauma/no PTSD, women with remitted PTSD symptoms had a similar cognitive function at baseline, while women with unresolved PTSD symptoms had worse psychomotor speed/attention and learning/working memory. In women with unresolved PTSD symptoms, past-month PTSD symptom severity was inversely associated with baseline cognition. Over follow-up, both women with remitted and unresolved PTSD symptoms in 2008, especially those with high levels of symptoms, had a faster decline in learning/working memory than women with trauma/no PTSD. In women with remitted PTSD symptoms, higher lifetime PTSD symptom severity was associated with a faster decline in learning/working memory. Results were robust to the adjustment for sociodemographic, biobehavioral, and health factors and were partially attenuated when adjusted for depression. Conclusion Unresolved but not remitted PTSD was associated with worse cognitive function assessed six years later. Accelerated cognitive decline was observed among women with either unresolved or remitted PTSD symptoms.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Yet, the underlying neurobiological susceptibility signatures remain elusive. Here, we used a longitudinal twin neuroimaging study to investigate the brain network integration and its heritable relation to underpin the neural differential susceptibility of adolescent anxiety to parenting environments. Methods 216 twins from the Beijing Twin Study completed the parenting and anxiety assessments and fMRI scanning. We first identified the brain network integration involved in the influences of parenting at age 12 on anxiety symptoms at age 15. We then estimated to what extent heritable sensitive factors are responsible for the susceptibility of brain network integration. Results Consistent with the differential susceptibility theory, the results showed that hypo-connectivity within the central executive network amplified the impact of maternal hostility on anxiety symptoms. A high anti-correlation between the anterior salience and default mode networks played a similar modulatory role in the susceptibility of adolescent anxiety to paternal hostility. Genetic influences (21.18%) were observed for the connectivity pattern in the central executive network. Conclusions Brain network integration served as a promising neurobiological signature of the differential susceptibility to adolescent anxiety. Our findings deepen the understanding of the neural sensitivity in the developing brain and can inform early identification and personalized interventions for adolescents at risk of anxiety disorders.  © 2023 The Author(s).

To explore the association of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) health with the risk of depression and anxiety and to investigate the joint association of CKM health and social connection with depression and anxiety. Methods. This prospective cohort study included 344 956 participants from the UK Biobank. CKM syndrome was identified as a medical condition with the presence of metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, and was classified into five stages (stage 0–4) in this study. Loneliness and social isolation status were determined by self-reported questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards models were applied for analyses. Results. Compared with participants in stage 0, the HRs for depression were 1.17 (95% CI 1.10–1.25), 1.40 (95% CI 1.33–1.48), and 2.14 (95% CI 1.98–2.31) for participants in stage 1, 2–3, and 4, respectively.

We found additive interactions between loneliness and CKM health on the risk of depression and anxiety. Participants simultaneously reported being lonely and in stage 4 had the greatest risk of depression (HR = 4.44, 95% CI 3.89–5.07) and anxiety (HR = 2.58, 95% CI 2.21–3.01) compared with those without loneliness and in stage 0. We also observed an additive interaction between social isolation and CKM health on the risk of depression. Conclusions.

Observational studies consistently report associations between tobacco use, cannabis use and mental illness. However, the extent to which this association reflects an increased risk of new-onset mental illness is unclear and may be biased by unmeasured confounding. Methods. A systematic review and meta-analysis (CRD42021243903). Electronic databases were searched until November 2022. Longitudinal studies in general population samples assessing tobacco and/or cannabis use and reporting the association (e.g. risk ratio [RR]) with incident anxiety, mood, or psychotic disorders were included. Estimates were combined using random-effects meta-analyses. Bias was explored using a modified Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, confounder matrix, E-values, and Doi plots. Results. Seventy-five studies were included. Tobacco use was associated with mood disorders (K = 43; RR: 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.47), but not anxiety disorders (K = 7; RR: 1.21, 95% CI 0.87–1.68) and evidence for psychotic disorders was influenced by treatment of outliers (K = 4, RR: 3.45, 95% CI 2.63–4.53; K = 5, RR: 2.06, 95% CI 0.98–4.29). Cannabis use was associated with psychotic disorders (K = 4; RR: 3.19, 95% CI 2.07–4.90), but not mood (K = 7; RR: 1.31, 95% CI 0.92–1.86) or anxiety disorders (K = 7; RR: 1.10, 95% CI 0.99–1.22). Confounder matrices and E-values suggested potential overestimation of effects. Only 27% of studies were rated as high quality. Conclusions. Both substances were associated with psychotic disorders and tobacco use was associated with mood disorders. There was no clear evidence of an association between cannabis use and mood or anxiety disorders. Limited high-quality studies underscore the need for future research using robust causal inference approaches (e.g. evidence triangulation). © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

The COVID-19 pandemic introduced unique stressors that posed significant threats to adolescent mental health. However, limited research has examined the impact of trauma exposure on vulnerability to subsequent stressor-related mental health outcomes in adolescents. Furthermore, it is unclear whether there are protective factors that promote resilience against the negative impacts of COVID-19 stressors in adolescents with prior trauma exposure. This preregistered study aimed to investigate the impact of trauma on COVID-19 stressor-related mental health difficulties in adolescents, in addition to the role of protective factors. Methods. Aims were investigated in a sample of 9696 adolescents (mean age 12.85 ± 0.88 years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to examine (a) the associations of early trauma exposure (exposed v. non-exposed), COVID-19 stressors, and perceived stress, sadness, and positive affect levels during the pandemic period in the US, and (b) the role of protective factors (physical activity, parental support, and improvements in family and peer relationships) in these associations. Results. There was a positive association between COVID-19 stressors and sadness, which was enhanced in trauma-exposed adolescents. Improvements in family and peer relationships mitigated the association between COVID-19 stressors and poor mental health outcomes, regardless of prior traumatic experience. Conclusions. These findings support the hypothesis that prior trauma elevates risk of mental health difficulties in the face of future stressors. Results underscore the protective role of enhanced social relationships as targets for early prevention and intervention in those experiencing acute stressors, regardless of prior traumatic experiences. © The Author(s), 2024.

There is however, limited knowledge about the longitudinal course of this relationship. Methods Systemic inflammation (C-Reactive Protein, CRP) and cognition (nine cognitive domains) was measured from baseline to 1 year follow-up in first treatment SZ and BD (n = 221), and healthy controls (HC, n = 220). Linear mixed models were used to evaluate longitudinal changes separately in CRP and cognitive domains specific to diagnostic status (SZ, BD, HC). Hierarchical clustering was applied on the entire sample to investigate the longitudinal course of transdiagnostic inflammatory-cognitive subgroups. Results There were no case-control differences or change in CRP from baseline to follow-up. We confirm previous observations of case-control differences in cognition at both time-points and domain specific stability/improvement over time regardless of diagnostic status. We identified transdiagnostic inflammatory-cognitive subgroups at baseline with differing demographics and clinical severity. Despite improvement in cognition, symptoms and functioning, the higher inflammation - lower cognition subgroup (75% SZ; 48% BD; 38% HC) had sustained inflammation and lower cognition, more symptoms, and lower functioning (SMI only) at follow-up. This was in comparison to a lower inflammation - higher cognition subgroup (25% SZ, 52% BD, 62% HC), where SMI participants showed cognitive functioning at HC level with a positive clinical course. Conclusions Our findings support heterogenous and transdiagnostic inflammatory-cognitive subgroups that are stable over time, and may benefit from targeted interventions.

However, it is unclear whether these risks make epigenetic clocks 'tick faster' (i.e. accelerate biological aging). The current study examines concurrent and lagged within-person changes of a variety of health risks associated with epigenetic aging. Methods Individuals from the Great Smoky Mountains Study were followed from age 9 to 35 years. DNA methylation profiles were assessed from blood, at multiple timepoints (i.e. waves) for each individual. Health risks were psychiatric, lifestyle, and adversity factors. Concurrent (N = 539 individuals; 1029 assessments) and lagged (N = 380 individuals; 760 assessments) analyses were used to determine the link between health risks and epigenetic aging. Results Concurrent models showed that BMI (r = 0.15, PFDR < 0.01) was significantly correlated to epigenetic aging at the subject-level but not wave-level. Lagged models demonstrated that depressive symptoms (b = 1.67 months per symptom, PFDR = 0.02) in adolescence accelerated epigenetic aging in adulthood, also when models were fully adjusted for BMI, smoking, and cannabis and alcohol use. Conclusions Within-persons, changes in health risks were unaccompanied by concurrent changes in epigenetic aging, suggesting that it is unlikely for risks to immediately 'accelerate' epigenetic aging. However, time lagged analyses indicated that depressive symptoms in childhood/adolescence predicted epigenetic aging in adulthood. Together, findings suggest that age-related biological embedding of depressive symptoms is not instant but provides prognostic opportunities. Repeated measurements and longer follow-up times are needed to examine stable and dynamic contributions of childhood experiences to epigenetic aging across the lifespan.

The clinical course of major depressive disorder (MDD) is heterogeneous, and early-onset MDD often has a more severe and complex clinical course. Our goal was to determine whether polygenic scores (PGSs) for psychiatric disorders are associated with treatment trajectories in early-onset MDD treated in secondary care. Methods. Data were drawn from the iPSYCH2015 sample, which includes all individuals born in Denmark between 1981 and 2008 who were treated in secondary care for depression between 1995 and 2015. We selected unrelated individuals of European ancestry with an MDD diagnosis between ages 10–25 (N = 10577). Seven-year trajectories of hospital contacts for depression were modeled using Latent Class Growth Analysis. Associations between PGS for MDD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, and anorexia and trajectories of MDD contacts were modeled using multinomial logistic regressions. Results. We identified four trajectory patterns: brief contact (65%), prolonged initial contact (20%), later re-entry (8%), and persistent contact (7%). Relative to the brief contact trajectory, higher PGS for ADHD was associated with a decreased odds of membership in the prolonged initial contact (odds ratio = 1.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.01–1.11) and persistent contact (1.12, 1.03–1.21) trajectories, while PGS-AN was associated with increased odds of membership in the persistent contact trajectory (1.12, 1.03–1.21). Conclusions. We found significant associations between polygenic liabilities for psychiatric disorders and treatment trajectories in patients with secondary-treated early-onset MDD. These findings help elucidate the relationship between a patient’s genetics and their clinical course; however, the effect sizes are small and therefore unlikely to have predictive value in clinical settings. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Involuntary admissions to psychiatric hospitals are on the rise. If patients at elevated risk of involuntary admission could be identified, prevention may be possible. Our aim was to develop and validate a prediction model for involuntary admission of patients receiving care within a psychiatric service system using machine learning trained on routine clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs). Methods. EHR data from all adult patients who had been in contact with the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region between 2013 and 2021 were retrieved. We derived 694 patient predictors (covering e.g. diagnoses, medication, and coercive measures) and 1134 predictors from free text using term frequency-inverse document frequency and sentence transformers. At every voluntary inpatient discharge (prediction time), without an involuntary admission in the 2 years prior, we predicted involuntary admission 180 days ahead. XGBoost and elastic net models were trained on 85% of the dataset. The models with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were tested on the remaining 15% of the data. Results. The model was trained on 50 634 voluntary inpatient discharges among 17 968 patients. The cohort comprised of 1672 voluntary inpatient discharges followed by an involuntary admission. The best XGBoost and elastic net model from the training phase obtained an AUROC of 0.84 and 0.83, respectively, in the test phase. Conclusion. A machine learning model using routine clinical EHR data can accurately predict involuntary admission. If implemented as a clinical decision support tool, this model may guide interventions aimed at reducing the risk of involuntary admission. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Lower doses of antipsychotics have been associated with increased level of function but also with increased risk of relapse. This study presents findings from a specialized deprescribing clinic. In addition, we aim to identify clinical predictors for relapse. Methods Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were referred to the clinic, which offers a six-month guided tapering program. Antipsychotic dose was reduced by 10% every four weeks. Patients were monitored closely for symptom progression or decrease in level of function, with defined cut-offs prompting a pause in or cessation of dose reduction. Results After 12 months, the antipsychotic dose was reduced from 404 (±320 mg) to 255 (±236 mg) chlorpromazine equivalent. Of the 88 patients included, 22 (27%) experienced relapse during the six-month tapering period, while 29 (37%) experienced relapse at the 12-month follow-up visit and nine patients were antipsychotic free. Patients who remained stable experienced a slightly increased level of functioning and markedly fewer side effects (p < 0.001). Following relapse, patients were clinically stabilized and showed an improved attitude toward antipsychotic medication. The predictive models were weak. Conclusions We show that most patients undergoing guided antipsychotic tapering remained stable after one year and improved in level of function, while most patients who relapsed were quickly stabilized. Our inability to create strong predictive models could be due to limitations in the study design, warranting future studies exploring tapering of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia.  © The Author(s), 2024.

Identification of risk for depressive disorders (DD) in this key developmental stage can help prevention efforts, mitigating the clinical and public burden of DD. While frequently used in diagnosis, nonverbal behaviors are relatively understudied as risk markers for DD. Digital technology, such as facial recognition, may provide objective, fast, efficient, and cost-effective means of measuring nonverbal behavior. Method Here, we analyzed video-recorded clinical interviews of 359 never-depressed adolescents females via commercially available facial emotion recognition software. Results We found that average head and facial movements forecast future first onset of depression (AUC = 0.70) beyond the effects of other established self-report and physiological markers of DD risk. Conclusions Overall, these findings suggest that digital assessment of nonverbal behaviors may provide a promising risk marker for DD, which could aid in early identification and intervention efforts.

However, these patterns are disrupted by aging and psychiatric conditions. This study aims to investigate how fractal patterns vary across the sleep-wake cycle, differ based on individuals' recency of depression diagnosis, and change before and after a depressive episode. Methods Using actigraphy from two cohorts (n = 378), we examined fractal motor activity patterns both between individuals without depression and with varying recencies of depression and within individuals before and after depressive symptom recurrence. To evaluate fractal patterns, we quantified temporal correlations in motor activity fluctuations across different time scales using a scaling exponent, α. Linear mixed models were utilized to assess the influence of the sleep-wake cycle, (recency of) depression, and their interaction on α. Results Fractal activity patterns in all individuals varied across the sleep-wake cycle, showing stronger temporal correlations during wakefulness (larger α = 1.035 ± 0.003) and more random activity fluctuations during sleep (smaller α = 0.784 ± 0.004, p < 0.001). This sleep-wake difference was reduced in recently depressed individuals (1-6 months), leading to larger α during sleep (0.836 ± 0.017), compared to currently depressed (0.781 ± 0.018, p = 0.006), remitted (0.776 ± 0.014, p < 0.001), and never-depressed individuals (0.773 ± 0.016, p < 0.001). Moreover, remitted individuals who experienced depressive symptom recurrence during antidepressant tapering exhibited a larger α during sleep after the symptom onset as compared to before (after: α = 0.703 ± 0.022; before: α = 0.680 ± 0.022; p < 0.001). Conclusions These findings suggest a link between fractal motor activity patterns during sleep and depressive symptom recurrence in remitted individuals and those with recent depression.

Previous studies have primarily focused on undirected functional connectivity and rarely reported from network perspective. Methods To better understand between or within-network connectivities of OCD, effective connectivity (EC) of a large-scale network is assessed by spectral dynamic causal modeling with eight key regions of interests from default mode (DMN), salience (SN), frontoparietal (FPN) and cerebellum networks, based on large sample size including 100 OCD patients and 120 healthy controls (HCs). Parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) framework was used to identify the difference between the two groups. We further analyzed the relationship between connections and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Results OCD and HCs shared some similarities of inter- and intra-network patterns in the resting state. Relative to HCs, patients showed increased ECs from left anterior insula (LAI) to medial prefrontal cortex, right anterior insula (RAI) to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (R-DLPFC) to cerebellum anterior lobe (CA), CA to posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Moreover, weaker from LAI to L-DLPFC, RAI to ACC, and the self-connection of R-DLPFC. Connections from ACC to CA and from L-DLPFC to PCC were positively correlated with compulsion and obsession scores (r = 0.209, p = 0.037; r = 0.199, p = 0.047, uncorrected). Conclusions Our study revealed dysregulation among DMN, SN, FPN, and cerebellum in OCD, emphasizing the role of these four networks in achieving top-down control for goal-directed behavior. There existed a top-down disruption among these networks, constituting the pathophysiological and clinical basis.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Studies suggest severe mental disorders (SMDs), such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, are associated with common alterations in brain activity, albeit with a graded level of impairment. However, discrepancies between study findings likely to results from both small sample sizes and the use of different functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks. To address these issues, data-driven meta-analytic approach designed to identify homogeneous brain co-activity patterns across tasks was conducted to better characterize the common and distinct alterations between these disorders. Methods. A hierarchical clustering analysis was conducted to identify groups of studies reporting similar neuroimaging results, independent of task type and psychiatric diagnosis. A traditional meta-analysis (activation likelihood estimation) was then performed within each of these groups of studies to extract their aberrant activation maps. Results. A total of 762 fMRI study contrasts were targeted, comprising 13 991 patients with SMDs. Hierarchical clustering analysis identified 5 groups of studies (meta-analytic groupings; MAGs) being characterized by distinct aberrant activation patterns across SMDs: (1) emotion processing; (2) cognitive processing; (3) motor processes, (4) reward processing, and (5) visual processing. While MAG1 was mostly commonly impaired, MAG2 was more impaired in schizophrenia, while MAG3 and MAG5 revealed no differences between disorder. MAG4 showed the strongest between-diagnoses differences, particularly in the striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions. SMDs are characterized mostly by common deficits in brain networks, although differences between disorders are also present. This study highlights the importance of studying SMDs simultaneously rather than independently. © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

First-episode schizophrenia (FES) is a progressive psychiatric disorder influenced by genetics, environmental factors, and brain function. The functional gradient deficits of drug-naïve FES and its relationship to gene expression profiles and treatment outcomes are unknown. Methods. In this study, we engaged a cohort of 116 FES and 100 healthy controls (HC), aged 7 to 30 years, including 15 FES over an 8-week antipsychotic medication regimen. Our examination focused on primary-to-transmodal alterations in voxel-based connection gradients in FES. Then, we employed network topology, Neurosynth, postmortem gene expression, and support vector regression to evaluate integration and segregation functions, meta-analytic cognitive terms, transcriptional patterns, and treatment predictions. Results. FES displayed diminished global connectome gradients (Cohen’s d = 0.32–0.57) correlated with compensatory integration and segregation functions (Cohen’s d = 0.31–0.36). Predominant alterations were observed in the default (67.6%) and sensorimotor (21.9%) network, related to high-order cognitive functions. Furthermore, we identified notable overlaps between partial least squares (PLS1) weighted genes and dysregulated genes in other psychiatric conditions. Genes linked with gradient alterations were enriched in synaptic signaling, neurodevelopment process, specific astrocytes, cortical layers (layer II and IV), and developmental phases from late/mid fetal to young adulthood. Additionally, the onset age influenced the severity of FES, with discernible differences in connection gradients between minor- and adult-FES. Moreover, the connectivity gradients of FES at baseline significantly predicted treatment outcomes. Conclusions. These results offer significant theoretical foundations for elucidating the intricate interplay between macroscopic functional connection gradient changes and microscopic transcriptional patterns during the onset and progression of FES. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) can be used to quantify cumulative genetic risk for a trait at an individual level. Recent studies suggest PRSs for anorexia nervosa (AN) may also predict risk for other disordered eating behaviors, but no study has examined if PRS for AN can predict disordered eating as a global continuous measure. This study aimed to investigate whether PRS for AN predicted overall levels of disordered eating, or specific lifetime disordered eating behaviors, in an Australian adolescent female population. Methods PRSs were calculated based on summary statistics from the largest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN genome-wide association study to date. Analyses were performed using genome-wide complex trait analysis to test the associations between AN PRS and disordered eating global scores, avoidance of eating, objective bulimic episodes, self-induced vomiting, and driven exercise in a sample of Australian adolescent female twins recruited from the Australian Twin Registry (N = 383). Results After applying the false-discovery rate correction, the AN PRS was significantly associated with all disordered eating outcomes. Conclusions Findings suggest shared genetic etiology across disordered eating presentations and provide insight into the utility of AN PRS for predicting disordered eating behaviors in the general population. In the future, PRSs for EDs may have clinical utility in early disordered eating risk identification, prevention, and intervention.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

However, few studies have utilized a large multisite dataset to understand this complex relationship. Our study assessed the relationship between alcohol and cannabis use trajectories and PTSD and depression symptoms across 3 months in recently trauma-exposed civilians. Methods In total, 1618 (1037 female) participants provided self-report data on past 30-day alcohol and cannabis use and PTSD and depression symptoms during their emergency department (baseline) visit. We reassessed participant's substance use and clinical symptoms 2, 8, and 12 weeks posttrauma. Latent class mixture modeling determined alcohol and cannabis use trajectories in the sample. Changes in PTSD and depression symptoms were assessed across alcohol and cannabis use trajectories via a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results Three trajectory classes (low, high, increasing use) provided the best model fit for alcohol and cannabis use. The low alcohol use class exhibited lower PTSD symptoms at baseline than the high use class; the low cannabis use class exhibited lower PTSD and depression symptoms at baseline than the high and increasing use classes; these symptoms greatly increased at week 8 and declined at week 12. Participants who already use alcohol and cannabis exhibited greater PTSD and depression symptoms at baseline that increased at week 8 with a decrease in symptoms at week 12. Conclusions Our findings suggest that alcohol and cannabis use trajectories are associated with the intensity of posttrauma psychopathology. These findings could potentially inform the timing of therapeutic strategies. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Both domains are linked to self-esteem, which serves as a protective factor against a wide range of internalizing and externalizing problems. This study examined trends in US adolescents' self-esteem and externalizing symptoms, and their correlation, by sex and patterns of time use. Methods Using Monitoring the Future data (N = 338 896 adolescents, grades:8/10/12, years:1991-2020), we generated six patterns of time use using latent profile analysis with 17 behavior items (e.g. sports participation, parties, paid work). Groups were differentiated by high/low engagement in sports and either paid work or high/low peer socialization. Within each group, we mapped annual, sex-stratified means of (and correlation between) self-esteem and externalizing factors. We also examined past-decade rates of change for factor means using linear regression and mapped proportions with top-quartile levels of poor self-esteem, externalizing symptoms, or both. Results We found consistent increases in poor self-esteem, decreases in externalizing symptoms, and a positive correlation between the two across nearly all activity groups. We also identified a relatively constant proportion of those with high levels of both in every group. Increases in poor self-esteem were most pronounced for female adolescents with low levels of socializing, among whom externalizing symptoms also increased. Conclusions Rising trends in poor self-esteem are consistent across time use groups, as is the existence of a group facing poor self-esteem and externalizing symptoms. Effective interventions for adolescents' poor self-esteem/co-occurring symptoms are needed broadly, but especially among female adolescents with low peer socialization. © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods Seventy five patients participated in this trial consisting of 20 sessions over 5 consecutive days comparing dual-site (cTBS of right lOFC followed sequentially by 20 Hz rTMS of left dlPFC), active control (sham right lOFC followed by 20 Hz rTMS of left dlPFC) and sham control (sham for both targets). Resting-state fMRI was acquired prior to and following treatment. Results Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-24) scores were similarly significantly improved at 4 weeks in both the Dual and Single group relative to Sham. Planned comparisons immediately after treatment highlighted greater HRSD-24 clinical responders (Dual: 47.8% v. Single:18.2% v. Sham:4.3%, χ2 = 13.0, p = 0.002) and in PHQ-9 scores by day 5 in the Dual relative to Sham group. We further showed that accelerated 20 Hz stimulation targeting the left dlPFC (active control) is significantly better than sham at 4 weeks. Dual stimulation decreased lOFC-subcallosal cingulate functional connectivity. Greater baseline lOFC-thalamic connectivity predicted better therapeutic response, while decreased lOFC-thalamic connectivity correlated with better response. Conclusions Our novel accelerated dual TMS protocol shows rapid clinically relevant antidepressant efficacy which may be related to state-modulation. This study has implications for community-based accessible TMS without neuronavigation and rapid onset targeting suicidal ideation and accelerated discharge from hospital.

Yet, we lack understanding of the potential social processes underlying early psychopathological development. We propose a conceptual model where daily-life social interactions and social skills form an intermediate link between known risk and protective factors (adverse childhood experiences, bullying, social support, maladaptive parenting) and psychopathology in adolescents - that is explored using cross-sectional data. Methods N = 1913 Flemish adolescent participants (Mean age = 13.8; 63% girls) were assessed as part of the SIGMA study, a large-scale, accelerated longitudinal study of adolescent mental health and development. Self-report questionnaires (on risk/protective factors, social skills, and psychopathology) were completed during class time; daily-life social interactions were measured during a subsequent six-day experience-sampling period. Results Registered uncorrected multilevel linear regression results revealed significant associations between all risk/protective factors and psychopathology, between all risk/protective factors and social processes, and between all social processes and psychopathology. Social processes (social skills, quantity/quality of daily social interactions) were uniquely predicted by each risk/protective factor and were uniquely associated with both general and specific types of psychopathology. For older participants, some relationships between social processes and psychopathology were stronger. Conclusions Unique associations between risk/protective factors and psychopathology signify the distinct relevance of these factors for youth mental health, whereas the broad associations with social processes support these processes as broad correlates. Results align with the idea of a social pathway toward early psychopathology, although follow-up longitudinal research is required to verify any mediation effect.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

When selecting goals, people maximize 'expected value' by selecting actions that maximize potential reward while minimizing associated costs, including effort 'costs' and the opportunity cost of time. In MDD, differential weighing of costs and benefits are theorized mechanisms underlying changes in goal-directed cognition and may contribute to symptom heterogeneity. Methods We used the Effort Foraging Task to quantify cognitive and physical effort costs, and patch leaving thresholds in low effort conditions (reflecting perceived opportunity cost of time) and investigated their shared versus distinct relationships to clinical features in participants with MDD (N = 52, 43 in-episode) and comparisons (N = 27). Results Contrary to our predictions, none of the decision-making measures differed with MDD diagnosis. However, each of the measures was related to symptom severity, over and above effects of ability (i.e. performance). Greater anxiety symptoms were selectively associated with lower cognitive effort cost (i.e. greater willingness to exert effort). Anhedonia and behavioral apathy were associated with increased physical effort costs. Finally, greater overall depression was related to decreased patch leaving thresholds. Conclusions Markers of effort-based decision-making may inform understanding of MDD heterogeneity. Increased willingness to exert cognitive effort may contribute to anxiety symptoms such as worry. Decreased leaving threshold associations with symptom severity are consistent with reward rate-based accounts of reduced vigor in MDD. Future research should address subtypes of depression with or without anxiety, which may relate differentially to cognitive effort decisions. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

ADHD symptoms are associated with emotional problems such as depressive and anxiety symptoms from early childhood to adulthood, with the association increasing with age. A shared aetiology and/or a causal relationship could explain their correlation. In the current study, we explore these explanations for the association between ADHD symptoms and emotional problems from childhood to adulthood. Methods. Data were drawn from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), including 3675 identical and 7063 non-identical twin pairs. ADHD symptoms and emotional symptoms were reported by parents from childhood to adulthood. Self-report scales were included from early adolescence. Five direction of causation (DoC) twin models were fitted to distinguish whether associations were better explained by shared aetiology and/or causal relationships in early childhood, mid-childhood, early adolescence, late adolescence, and early adulthood. Followup analyses explored associations for the two subdomains of ADHD symptoms, hyperactivity-impulsivity and inattention, separately. Results. The association between ADHD symptoms and emotional problems increased in magnitude from early childhood to adulthood. In the best-fitting models, positive genetic overlap played an important role in this association at all stages. A negative causal effect running from ADHD symptoms to emotional problems was also detected in early childhood and mid-childhood. When distinguishing ADHD subdomains, the apparent protective effect of ADHD symptoms on emotional problems in childhood was mostly driven by hyperactivity-impulsivity. Conclusions. Genetic overlap plays an important role in the association between ADHD symptoms and emotional problems. Hyperactivity-impulsivity may protect children from emotional problems in childhood, but this protective effect diminishes after adolescence. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Associations between childhood trauma, neurodevelopment, alcohol use disorder (AUD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are understudied during adolescence. Methods. Using 1652 participants (51.75% female, baseline Mage = 14.3) from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism, we employed latent growth curve models to (1) examine associations of childhood physical, sexual, and non-assaultive trauma (CPAT, CSAT, and CNAT) with repeated measures of alpha band EEG coherence (EEGc), and (2) assess whether EEGc trajectories were associated with AUD and PTSD symptoms. Sex-specific models accommodated sex differences in trauma exposure, AUD prevalence, and neural development. Results. In females, CSAT was associated with higher mean levels of EEGc in left frontocentral (LFC, ß = 0.13, p = 0.01) and interhemispheric prefrontal (PFI, ß = 0.16, p < 0.01) regions, but diminished growth in LFC (ß = −0.07, p = 0.02) and PFI (ß = −0.07, p = 0.02). In males, CPAT was associated with lower mean levels (ß = −0.17, p = 0.01) and increased growth (ß = 0.11, p = 0.01) of LFC EEGc. Slope of LFC EEGc was inversely associated with AUD symptoms in females (ß = −1.81, p = 0.01). Intercept of right frontocentral and PFI EEGc were associated with AUD symptoms in males, but in opposite directions. Significant associations between EEGc and PTSD symptoms were also observed in trauma-exposed individuals. Conclusions. Childhood assaultive trauma is associated with changes in frontal alpha EEGc and subsequent AUD and PTSD symptoms, though patterns differ by sex and trauma type. EEGc findings may inform emerging treatments for PTSD and AUD. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

There is a compelling need for innovative intervention strategies for patients with affective disorders, given their increasing global prevalence and significant associated disability and impaired functioning. This study aimed to investigate whether a comprehensive multimodule individualized intervention (AWARE), targeting known mediators of functioning, improves functioning in affective disorders. Methods. AWARE was a randomized, controlled, rater-blind clinical trial conducted at two centers in the Capital Region of Denmark (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT 04701827). Participants were adults with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder and impaired functioning. Participants were randomized to the six-month AWARE intervention or treatment as usual (TAU). The AWARE intervention is based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Brief Core Set for Bipolar and Unipolar Disorder. The primary outcome was observation-based functioning using the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS). Secondary outcomes were functioning, QoL, stress, and cognition. Results. Between February 2021 and January 2023, 103 patients were enrolled; 50 allocated to AWARE treatment and 53 to TAU (96 included in the full analysis set). There was no statistically significant differential change over time between groups in the primary outcome (AMPS), however, both groups showed a statistically significant improvement at endpoint. The AWARE intervention had a statistically significant effect compared with TAU on secondary outcomes of patient-reported functioning, stress and cognition. Conclusion. Compared with TAU, the AWARE intervention was ineffective at improving overall functioning on the primary outcome, presumably due to the short duration of the intervention. Further development of effective treatments targeting functioning is needed. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 may be influenced by biomedical, psychological, and social factors, the interplay of which is largely understudied over time. We aimed to investigate how the interplay of these factors contribute to the persistence of symptoms after COVID-19. Methods RECoVERED, a prospective cohort study in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, enrolled participants aged ≥16 years after SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. We used a structural network analysis to assess relationships between biomedical (initial COVID-19 severity, inflammation markers), psychological (illness perceptions, coping, resilience), and social factors (loneliness, negative life events) and persistent symptoms 24 months after initial disease (severe fatigue, difficulty concentrating, depressive symptoms and limitations in physical functioning). Causal discovery, an explorative data-driven approach testing all possible associations and retaining the most likely model, was performed. Results Data from 235/303 participants (77.6%) who completed the month 24 study visit were analysed. The structural model revealed associations between the putative factors and outcomes. The outcomes clustered together with severe fatigue as its central point. Loneliness, fear avoidance in response to symptoms, and illness perceptions were directly linked to the outcomes. Biological (inflammatory markers) and clinical (severity of initial illness) variables were connected to the outcomes only via psychological or social variables.

It remains uncertain whether long-term use of benzodiazepines is associated with age-related cognitive decline, and if cognitive ability in early life is the driver of any association. This study examines the association of cognitive ability in young adulthood with later use of benzodiazepines and explores whether the use of benzodiazepines during adult life is associated with cognitive decline in late midlife. Methods. The study samples include cognitive tests on the Børge Priens Prøve (BPP) from the conscription board examination (age 19 years) from 335 513 men born 1949-1961 and data from re-examinations of 5183 men 44 years later. Cognitive decline was defined as the difference between scores at the conscription board and the re-examination. Information on purchases of benzodiazepines was obtained from the Danish National Prescription Registry, 1995-2022. Associations were analysed using Cox proportional hazards and linear regression. Results. In total, 120 911 (36%) men purchased benzodiazepines during a follow-up of 20 years. Lower cognitive scores in young adulthood were associated with a higher risk of initiating benzodiazepines (hazard ratio [95% CI] = 0.71[0.68-0.75]). Men with the highest cumulative use of benzodiazepines had larger cognitive decline (β-coefficient [95% CI] = -1.66 [-2.09 to -1.23] BPP scores) compared with never users. Current benzodiazepine users showed a larger cognitive decline than never users (β-coefficient [95% CI] = -2.42[-3.18 to -1.66] BPP scores) and this partially explained the above association. These estimates for cognitive decline were relatively small and may lack clinical relevance. Conclusion. Low cognitive ability increases the risk of benzodiazepine use in adulthood and cognitive decline is more pronounced in those with the highest benzodiazepine use compared with never-use, but the difference lacks clinical significance. © Municipality Region, Denmark, 2024.

Harsh parenting in early childhood is related to offspring’s adverse behavioral outcomes. Due to the scarcity of longitudinal neuroimaging data, few studies have explored the neurobiological underpinnings of this association, focusing on within-person variability. This study examined the temporal associations among harsh parenting, later behavioral problems, and the developmental trajectories of amygdala volume and amygdala resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) profiles, using longitudinal neuroimaging data. Methods. The study was embedded in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort. T1-weighted (296 children, 642 scans) and resting-state functional scans (256 children, 509 scans) were collected at ages 4.5, 6, 7.5, and 10.5 years. Amygdala volume and RSFC between the amygdala and six brain regions that have leading roles in emotional regulation were extracted. Harsh parenting at 4.5 years and child behavioral problems at 10.5 years were assessed via parent-report questionnaires. Linear regression and linear mixed models were applied. Results. Harsh parenting was associated with more severe externalizing problems in girls (β = 0.24, 95% CI 0.08–0.40) but not boys (pint = 0.07). In the overall sample, harsh parenting was associated with the developmental trajectories of amygdala-ACC, amygdala-OFC, and amygdala-DLPFC RSFC. In addition, the developmental trajectory of amygdala-ACC RSFC mediated the harsh parenting–externalizing problems association in girls (indirect effect = 0.06, 95% CI 0.01–0.14). Conclusions. Harsh parenting in early childhood was associated with amygdala neurocircuitry development and behavioral problems. The developmental trajectory of amygdala-ACC RSFC is a potential neural mechanism linking harsh parenting and externalizing problems in girls. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

It is therefore imperative that we improve our ability to predict the nature of the acute psychedelic experience to improve safety and optimize potential therapeutic outcomes. This study sought to validate the 'Imperial Psychedelic Predictor Scale' (IPPS), a short, widely applicable, prospective measure intended to be predictive of salient dimensions of the psychedelic experience. Methods Using four independent datasets in which the IPPS was completed prospectively - two online surveys of 'naturalistic' use (N = 741, N = 836) and two controlled administration datasets (N = 30, N = 28) - we conducted factor analysis, regression, and correlation analyses to assess the construct, predictive, and convergent validity of the IPPS. Results Our approach produced a 9-item scale with good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.8) containing three factors: set, rapport, and intention. The IPPS was significantly predictive of 'mystical', 'challenging', and 'emotional breakthrough' experiences. In a controlled administration dataset (N = 28), multiple regression found set and rapport explaining 40% of variance in mystical experience, and simple regression found set explained 16% of variance in challenging experience. In another (N = 30), rapport was related to emotional breakthrough explaining 9% of variance. Conclusions Together, these data suggest that the IPPS is predictive of relevant acute features of the psychedelic experience in a broad range of contexts. We hope that this brief 9-item scale will be widely adopted for improved knowledge of psychedelic preparedness in controlled settings and beyond.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

This fMRI study examines the reward valuation process under conditions of uncertainty and investigates the associated neural mechanisms in individuals who engage in nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) as a coping mechanism for psychological pain. Methods The study involved 44 unmedicated individuals who reported five or more NSSI episodes in the past year, along with 42 age-, sex-, handedness-, IQ-, and socioeconomic status-matched controls. During the fMRI scans, all participants were presented with decision-making scenarios involving uncertainty, both in terms of risk (known probabilities) and ambiguity (unknown probabilities). Results In the NSSI group, aversive attitudes toward ambiguity were correlated with increased emotion reactivity and greater method versatility. Whole-brain analysis revealed notable group-by-condition interactions in the right middle cingulate cortex and left hippocampus. Specifically, the NSSI group showed decreased neural activation under ambiguity v. risk compared to the control group. Moreover, reduced hippocampal activation under ambiguity in the NSSI group was associated with increased emotion regulation problems. Conclusions This study presents the first evidence of reduced brain activity in specific regions during value-based decision-making under conditions of ambiguity in individuals with NSSI. These findings have important clinical implications, particularly concerning emotion dysregulation in this population. This study indicates the need for interventions that support and guide individuals with NSSI to promote adaptive decision-making in the face of ambiguous uncertainty. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

Therefore, this study evaluates person-specific and pooled prediction models for binge eating (BE), alcohol use, and binge drinking (BD) in daily life, and identifies the most important predictors. Methods A total of 120 patients (BN: 50; AUD: 51; BN/AUD: 19) participated in an experience sampling study, where over a period of 12 months they reported on their eating and drinking behaviors as well as on several other emotional, behavioral, and contextual factors in daily life. The study had a burst-measurement design, where assessments occurred eight times a day on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays in seven bursts of three weeks. Afterwards, person-specific and pooled models were fit with elastic net regularized regression and evaluated with cross-validation. From these models, the variables with the 10% highest estimates were identified. Results The person-specific models had a median AUC of 0.61, 0.80, and 0.85 for BE, alcohol use, and BD respectively, while the pooled models had a median AUC of 0.70, 0.90, and 0.93. The most important predictors across the behaviors were craving and time of day. However, predictors concerning social context and affect differed among BE, alcohol use, and BD. Conclusions Pooled models outperformed person-specific models and the models for alcohol use and BD outperformed those for BE. Future studies should explore how the performance of these models can be improved and how they can be used to deliver interventions in daily life. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

We aimed to examine the associations of this new lung function impairment phenotype with depression and anxiety in longitudinal studies. Methods We included 369 597 participants from the UK Biobank cohort, and divided them into population 1 without depression or anxiety and population 2 with depression or anxiety at baseline. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to evaluate the associations of lung function impairment phenotype with adverse outcomes of depression and anxiety, as well as their subtypes. Results At baseline, 38 879 (10.5%) participants were diagnosed with PRISm. In population 1, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for PRISm (v. normal spirometry) were 1.12 (95% CI 1.07-1.18) for incident depression, and 1.11 (95% CI 1.06-1.15) for incident anxiety, respectively. In population 2, PRISm was a risk factor for mortality in participants with depression (HR: 1.46; 95% CI 1.31-1.62) and anxiety (HR: 1.70; 95% CI 1.44-2.02), compared with normal spirometry. The magnitudes of these associations were similar in the phenotypes of lung function impairment and the subtypes of mental disorders. Trajectory analysis showed that the transition from normal spirometry to PRISm was associated with a higher risk of mortality in participants with depression and anxiety. Conclusions PRISm and airflow obstruction have similar risks of depression and anxiety. PRISm recognition may contribute to the prevention of depression and anxiety.

Depression is a common mental health disorder that often starts during adolescence, with potentially important future consequences including ‘Not in Education, Employment or Training’ (NEET) status. Methods. We took a structured life course modeling approach to examine how depressive symptoms during adolescence might be associated with later NEET status, using a high-quality longitudinal data resource. We considered four plausible life course models: (1) an early adolescent sensitive period model where depressive symptoms in early adolescence are more associated with later NEET status relative to exposure at other stages; (2) a mid adolescent sensitive period model where depressive symptoms during the transition from compulsory education to adult life might be more deleterious regarding NEET status; (3) a late adolescent sensitive period model, meaning that depressive symptoms around the time when most adults have completed their education and started their careers are the most strongly associated with NEET status; and (4) an accumulation of risk model which highlights the importance of chronicity of symptoms. Results. Our analysis sample included participants with full information on NEET status (N = 3951), and the results supported the accumulation of risk model, showing that the odds of NEET increase by 1.015 (95% CI 1.012–1.019) for an increase of 1 unit in depression at any age between 11 and 24 years. Conclusions. Given the adverse implications of NEET status, our results emphasize the importance of supporting mental health during adolescence and early adulthood, as well as considering specific needs of young people with re-occurring depressed mood. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

We examined whether cannabis use contributes to the increased risk of psychotic disorder for non-western minorities in Europe. Methods. We used data from the EU-GEI study (collected at sites in Spain, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) on 825 first-episode patients and 1026 controls. We estimated the odds ratio (OR) of psychotic disorder for several groups of migrants compared with the local reference population, without and with adjustment for measures of cannabis use. Results. The OR of psychotic disorder for non-western minorities, adjusted for age, sex, and recruitment area, was 1.80 (95% CI 1.39-2.33). Further adjustment of this OR for frequency of cannabis use had a minimal effect: OR = 1.81 (95% CI 1.38-2.37). The same applied to adjustment for frequency of use of high-potency cannabis. Likewise, adjustments of ORs for most sub-groups of non-western countries had a minimal effect. There were two exceptions. For the Black Caribbean group in London, after adjustment for frequency of use of high-potency cannabis the OR decreased from 2.45 (95% CI 1.25-4.79) to 1.61 (95% CI 0.74-3.51). Similarly, the OR for Surinamese and Dutch Antillean individuals in Amsterdam decreased after adjustment for daily use: from 2.57 (95% CI 1.07-6.15) to 1.67 (95% CI 0.62-4.53). Conclusions. The contribution of cannabis use to the excess risk of psychotic disorder for non-western minorities was small. However, some evidence of an effect was found for people of Black Caribbean heritage in London and for those of Surinamese and Dutch Antillean heritage in Amsterdam. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Annual incidence was 255.6 per 100 000 soldiers, suggesting one in three SAs are undetected. In multivariable analysis, rank 3/4E5 (OR = 3.1[95%CI 1.6-5.7]) was associated with increased odds of undetected v. documented SA. Females were more likely to have a MH-Dx prior to their undetected SA (Rao-Scott χ 21 = 6.1, p =.01). Over one-fifth of undetected SAs resulted in at least moderate injury. Risk of undetected SA was greater during the first four years of service. Conclusions Findings suggest that substantially more soldiers make SAs than indicated by estimates based on documented attempts. A sizable minority of undetected SAs result in significant injury. Soldiers reporting an undetected SA tend to be higher ranking than those with documented SAs. Undetected SAs require additional approaches to identifying individuals at risk.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine if women and men differ in their vulnerability to risk factors for PTSD. Methods As part of the longitudinal AURORA study, 2924 patients seeking emergency department (ED) treatment in the acute aftermath of trauma provided self-report assessments of pre- peri- and post-traumatic risk factors, as well as 3-month PTSD severity. We systematically examined sex-dependent effects of 16 risk factors that have previously been hypothesized to show different associations with PTSD severity in women and men. Results Women reported higher PTSD severity at 3-months post-trauma. Z-score comparisons indicated that for five of the 16 examined risk factors the association with 3-month PTSD severity was stronger in men than in women. In multivariable models, interaction effects with sex were observed for pre-traumatic anxiety symptoms, and acute dissociative symptoms; both showed stronger associations with PTSD in men than in women. Subgroup analyses suggested trauma type-conditional effects. Conclusions Our findings indicate mechanisms to which men might be particularly vulnerable, demonstrating that known PTSD risk factors might behave differently in women and men. Analyses did not identify any risk factors to which women were more vulnerable than men, pointing toward further mechanisms to explain women's higher PTSD risk. Our study illustrates the need for a more systematic examination of sex differences in contributors to PTSD severity after trauma, which may inform refined preventive interventions.

Though prior research suggests pre-treatment engagement of brain regions supporting cognitive reappraisal (e.g. dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC]) foretells CBT response in SAD, it remains unknown if this extends to MDD or is specific to CBT. The current study examined associations between pre-treatment neural activity during reappraisal and clinical improvement in patients with SAD or MDD following a trial of CBT or supportive therapy (ST), a common-factors comparator arm. Methods Participants were 75 treatment-seeking patients with SAD (n = 34) or MDD (n = 41) randomized to CBT (n = 40) or ST (n = 35). Before randomization, patients completed a cognitive reappraisal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Additionally, patients completed clinician-administered symptom measures and a self-report cognitive reappraisal measure before treatment and every 2 weeks throughout treatment. Results Results indicated that pre-treatment neural activity during reappraisal differentially predicted CBT and ST response. Specifically, greater trajectories of symptom improvement throughout treatment were associated with less ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) activity for CBT patients, but more vlPFC activity for ST patients. Also, less baseline dlPFC activity corresponded with greater trajectories of self-reported reappraisal improvement, regardless of treatment arm. Conclusions If replicated, findings suggest individual differences in brain response during reappraisal may be transdiagnostically associated with treatment-dependent improvement in symptom severity, but improvement in subjective reappraisal following psychotherapy, more broadly.

Cardiometabolic disease risk factors are disproportionately prevalent in bipolar disorder (BD) and are associated with cognitive impairment. It is, however, unknown which health risk factors for cardiometabolic disease are relevant to cognition in BD. This study aimed to identify the cardiometabolic disease risk factors that are the most important correlates of cognitive impairment in BD; and to examine whether the nature of the relationships vary between mid and later life. Methods. Data from the UK Biobank were available for 966 participants with BD, aged between 40 and 69 years. Individual cardiometabolic disease risk factors were initially regressed onto a global cognition score in separate models for the following risk factor domains; (1) health risk behaviors (physical activity, sedentary behavior, smoking, and sleep) and (2) physiological risk factors, stratified into (2a) anthropometric and clinical risk (handgrip strength, body composition, and blood pressure), and (2b) cardiometabolic disease risk biomarkers (CRP, lipid profile, and HbA1c). A final combined multivariate regression model for global cognition was then fitted, including only the predictor variables that were significantly associated with cognition in the previous models. Results. In the final combined model, lower mentally active and higher passive sedentary behavior, higher levels of physical activity, inadequate sleep duration, higher systolic and lower diastolic blood pressure, and lower handgrip strength were associated with worse global cognition. Conclusions. Health risk behaviors, as well as blood pressure and muscular strength, are associated with cognitive function in BD, whereas other traditional physiological cardiometabolic disease risk factors are not. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

However, these findings have been not always consistent because of ADHD diversity. This study aimed to identify ADHD subtypes based on cognitive function and find their distinct brain structural characteristics. Methods Using the data of 656 children with ADHD from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, we applied unsupervised machine learning to identify ADHD subtypes using the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Tasks. Moreover, we compared the regional brain volumes between each ADHD subtype and 6601 children without ADHD (non-ADHD). Results Hierarchical cluster analysis automatically classified ADHD into three distinct subtypes: ADHD-A (n = 212, characterized by high-order cognitive ability), ADHD-B (n = 190, characterized by low cognitive control, processing speed, and episodic memory), and ADHD-C (n = 254, characterized by strikingly low cognitive control, working memory, episodic memory, and language ability). Structural analyses revealed that the ADHD-C type had significantly smaller volumes of the left inferior temporal gyrus and right lateral orbitofrontal cortex than the non-ADHD group, and the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex volume was positively correlated with language performance in the ADHD-C type. However, the volumes of the ADHD-A and ADHD-B types were not significantly different from those of the non-ADHD group. Conclusions These results indicate the presence of anomalies in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex associated with language deficits in the ADHD-C type. Subtype specificity may explain previous inconsistencies in brain structural anomalies reported in ADHD.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Controlled research examining maintenance treatments for responders to acute interventions for binge-eating disorder (BED) is limited. This study tested efficacy of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) maintenance treatment amongst acute responders. Methods. This prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-site trial, conducted March 2019 to September 2023, tested LDX as maintenance treatment for responders to acute treatments with LDX-alone or with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT + LDX) for BED with obesity. Sixty-one (83.6% women, mean age 44.3, mean BMI 36.1 kg/m2) acute responders were randomized to LDX (N = 32) or placebo (N = 29) for 12 weeks; 95.1% completed posttreatment assessments. Mixed-models and generalized-estimating equations comparing maintenance LDX v. placebo included main/interactive effects of acute (LDX or CBT + LDX) treatments to examine their predictive/moderating effects. Results. Relapse rates (to diagnosis-level binge-eating frequency) following maintenance treatments were 10.0% (N = 3/30) for LDX and 17.9% (N = 5/28) for placebo; intention-to-treat binge-eating remission rates were 59.4% (N = 19/32) and 65.5% (N = 19/29), respectively. Maintenance LDX and placebo did not differ significantly in binge-eating but differed in weight-loss and eating-disorder psychopathology. Maintenance LDX was associated with significant weight-loss (−2.3%) whereas placebo had significant weight-gain (+2.2%); LDX and placebo differed significantly in weight-change throughout treatment and at posttreatment. Eating-disorder psychopathology remained unchanged with LDX but increased significantly with placebo. Acute treatments did not significantly predict/moderate maintenance-treatment outcomes. Conclusions. Adults with BED/obesity who respond to acute lisdexamfetamine treatment (regardless of additionally receiving CBT) had good maintenance during subsequent 12-weeks. Maintenance lisdexamfetamine, relative to placebo, did not provide further benefit for binge-eating but was associated with significantly better eating-disorder psychopathology outcomes and greater weight-loss. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Cardiac vagal tone is an indicator of parasympathetic nervous system functioning, and there is increasing interest in its relation to antisocial behavior. It is unclear however whether antisocial individuals are characterized by increased or decreased vagal tone, and whether increased vagal tone is the source of the low heart rate frequently reported in antisocial populations. Methods. Participants consisted of four groups of community-dwelling adolescent boys aged 15.7 years: (1) controls, (2) childhood-only antisocial, (3) adolescent-only antisocial, and (4) persistently antisocial. Heart rate and vagal tone were assessed in three different conditions: rest, cognitive stressor, and social stressor. Results. All three antisocial groups had both lower resting heart rates and increased vagal tone compared to the low antisocial controls across all three conditions. Low heart rate partially mediated the relationship between vagal tone and antisocial behavior. Conclusions. Results indicate that increased vagal tone and reduced heart rate are relatively broad risk factors for different developmental forms of antisocial behavior. Findings are the first to implicate vagal tone as an explanatory factor in understanding heart rate antisocial behavior relationships. Future experimental work using non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation or heart rate variability biofeedback is needed to more systematically evaluate this conclusion. © 2024 Cambridge University Press.

Features of the caregiving environment influence youth's responses to environmental stressors, and youth's parasympathetic nervous system regulation may qualify the magnitude and/or direction of these effects. This prospective investigation evaluated diathesis stress and differential susceptibility models of caregiving and parasympathetic influences on youth's PTSS responses to COVID-19. Method Participants were 225 caregiver-youth dyads (youth 49.8% female at birth; 88.4% non-white) followed from childhood through adolescence and COVID-19. Youth's resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; Mage = 6.11, s.d. = 0.21), caregiving features (i.e. attachment security [youth Mage = 12.24, s.d. = 0.35] and caregiver internalizing psychopathology [caregiver Mage = 39.29, s.d. = 6.78]) were assessed pre-pandemic. Youth's PTSS was assessed one year prior to the US COVID-19 pandemic (Mage = 14.24, s.d. = 0.50) and during the spring of 2020 at the height of the pandemic (Mage = 15.23, s.d. = 0.57). Results Youth's PTSS increased during COVID-19. Youth with relatively high resting RSA evidenced the lowest PTSS when their caregiving environment featured high attachment security or low caregiver internalizing problems, but the highest PTSS when their caregiving environment featured low attachment security or high caregiver internalizing problems. In contrast, PTSS levels of youth with relatively low or average resting RSA did not differ significantly depending on attachment security or caregiver internalizing. Conclusions Results are consistent with a differential susceptibility hypothesis, wherein relatively high resting RSA conferred heightened sensitivity to caregiving environments in a for-better-and-for-worse manner during COVID-19.

However, very limited information is available about deficits in effort-cost-decision-making in the early stages of psychotic disorder and no study has investigated effort allocation deficits before the onset of bipolar disorder. Our aim was to investigate effort-based-decision-making in ultra-high-risk for psychosis (UHR-P) and bipolar disorder (UHR-BD). Methods Effort-cost decision-making performance was evaluated in UHR-P (n = 72) and UHR-BD (n = 68) and healthy controls (n = 38). Effort-Expenditure for Reward Task (EEfRT) was used. Results Compared to controls, both UHR-P and UHR-BD groups were associated with a reduced possibility to choose the harder task when the reward magnitudes and/or the likelihood of receiving the reward were high. In both groups, effort allocation abnormalities were associated with poor social functioning. Conclusions The current findings suggest that difficulties in effort-cost computation are transdiagnostic markers of illness liability in psychotic and bipolar disorders. In early intervention services, effort-based decision-making abnormalities should be considered as a target for interventions to manage motivational deficits in individuals at high risk for psychosis and BD. © The Author(s), 2024.

This study evaluated the RDoC (Research Domain Criteria) sub-construct of Self-Knowledge in relation to adolescent NSSI using multiple units of analysis. Methods One hundred and sixty-four adolescents assigned female at birth (AFAB), ages 12-16 years with and without a history of NSSI entered a study involving clinical assessment and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including structural, resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), and fMRI during a self-evaluation task. For imaging analyses, we used an a priori defined Self Network (anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices; precuneus). We first examined interrelationships among multi-level Self variables. We then evaluated the individual relationships between NSSI severity and multi-level Self variables (self-report, behavior, multi-modal brain Self Network measures), then conducted model testing and multiple regression to test how Self variables (together) predicted NSSI severity. Results Cross-correlations revealed key links between self-reported global self-worth and self-evaluation task behavior. Individually, greater NSSI severity correlated with lower global self-worth, more frequent and faster negative self-evaluations, lower anterior Self Network activation during self-evaluation, and lower anterior and posterior Self Network resting-state connectivity. Multiple regression analysis revealed the model including multi-level Self variables explained NSSI better than a covariate-only model; the strongest predictive variables included self-worth, self-evaluation task behavior, and resting-state connectivity. Conclusions Disruptions in Self-Knowledge across multiple levels of analysis relate to NSSI in adolescents. Findings suggest potential neurobiological treatment targets, potentially enhancing neuroplasticity in Self systems to facilitate greater flexibility (more frequently positive) of self-views in AFAB adolescents.

Different changes in EEG microstates can be observed in psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BD). However, the similarities and disparatenesses in whole-brain dynamics on a subsecond timescale among individuals diagnosed with SCZ, BD, and MDD are unclear. Methods This study included 1112 participants (380 individuals diagnosed with SCZ, 330 with BD, 212 with MDD, and 190 demographically matched healthy controls [HCs]). We assembled resting-state EEG data and completed a microstate analysis of all participants using a cross-sectional design. Results Our research indicates that SCZ, BD, and MDD exhibit distinct patterns of transition among the four EEG microstate states (A, B, C, and D). The analysis of transition probabilities showed a higher frequency of switching from microstates A to B and from B to A in each patient group compared to the HC group, and less frequent transitions from microstates A to C and from C to A in the SCZ and MDD groups compared to the HC group. And the probability of the microstate switching from C to D and D to C in the SCZ group significantly increased compared to those in the patient and HC groups. Conclusions Our findings provide crucial insights into the abnormalities involved in distributing neural assets and enabling proper transitions between different microstates in patients with major psychiatric disorders.  © The Author(s), 2024.

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often comorbid with other medical conditions in adult patients. However, ADHD is extremely underdiagnosed in adults and little is known about the medical comorbidities in undiagnosed adult individuals with high ADHD liability. In this study we investigated associations between ADHD genetic liability and electronic health record (EHR)-based ICD-10 diagnoses across all diagnostic categories, in individuals without ADHD diagnosis history. Methods. We used data from the Estonian Biobank cohort (N = 111 261) and generated polygenic risk scores (PRS) for ADHD (PRSADHD) based on the ADHD genome-wide association study. We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to test for associations between standardized PRSADHD and 1515 EHR-based ICD-10 diagnoses in the full and sex-stratified sample. We compared the observed significant ICD-10 associations to associations with (1) ADHD diagnosis and (2) questionnaire-based high ADHD risk analyses. Results. After Bonferroni correction (p = 3.3 × 10−5) we identified 80 medical conditions associated with PRSADHD. The strongest evidence was seen with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 1.15, CI 1.11–1.18), obesity (OR 1.13, CI 1.11–1.15), and type 2 diabetes (OR 1.11, CI 1.09–1.14). Sex-stratified analysis generally showed similar associations in males and females. Out of all identified associations, 40% and 78% were also observed using ADHD diagnosis or questionnaire-based ADHD, respectively, as the predictor. Conclusions. Overall our findings indicate that ADHD genetic liability is associated with an increased risk of a substantial number of medical conditions in undiagnosed individuals. These results highlight the need for timely detection and improved management of ADHD symptoms in adults. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

This association may be greater for disadvantaged societal groups (such as females) compared with advantaged groups (e.g. males). Given that persistent symptoms are observed across a range of disadvantaged, minoritized, and neurodivergent groups (e.g. low compared with high socio-economic status [SES]), the intersection of individual characteristics may be an important moderator of inequality. Methods Data from HeadStart Cornwall (N = 4441) was used to assess the effect of youth adversity on combined symptoms of depression and anxiety (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional problems subscale) measured at three time-points in 11-14-year-olds. Latent trajectories and regressions were estimated for eight intersectionality profiles (based on gender, SES, and hyperactivity/inattention), and moderating effects of the individual characteristics and their intersections were estimated. Results Youth adversity was associated with higher average depression/anxiety symptoms at baseline (11-12-years) across all intersectionality profiles. The magnitude of effects differed across profiles, with suggestive evidence for a moderating effect of youth adversity on change over time in depression/anxiety symptoms attributable to the intersection between (i) gender and SES; and (ii) gender, SES, and hyperactivity/inattention. Conclusions The detrimental effects of youth adversity pervade across intersectionality profiles. The extent to which these effects are moderated by intersectionality is discussed in terms of operational factors. The current results provide a platform for further research, which is needed to determine the importance of intersectionality as a moderator of youth adversity on the development of depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescence.

However, observational study designs cannot distinguish causal effects from confounding. Methods First, we conducted Mendelian randomisation (MR) using genetic instruments for vitamin-D and DHA identified in independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Outcomes were (1) GWAS for traits related to autism and ADHD, generated in the Norwegian mother, father, and child cohort study (MoBa) from 3 to 8 years, (2) autism and ADHD diagnoses. Second, we used mother-father-child trio-MR in MoBa (1) to test causal effects through maternal nutrient levels, (2) to test effects of child nutrient levels, and (3) as a paternal negative control. Results Associations between higher maternal vitamin-D levels on lower ADHD related traits at age 5 did not remain after controlling for familial genetic predisposition using trio-MR. Furthermore, we did not find evidence for causal maternal effects of vitamin-D/DHA levels on other offspring traits or diagnoses. In the reverse direction, there was evidence for a causal effect of autism genetic predisposition on lower vitamin-D levels and of ADHD genetic predisposition on lower DHA levels. Conclusions Triangulating across study designs, we did not find evidence for maternal effects. We add to a growing body of evidence that suggests that previous observational associations are likely biased by genetic confounding. Consequently, maternal supplementation is unlikely to influence these offspring neurodevelopmental traits. Notably, genetic predisposition to ADHD and autism was associated with lower DHA and vitamin-D levels respectively, suggesting previous associations might have been due to reverse causation.

Growing evidence points to the pivotal role of vitamin D in the pathophysiology and treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, there is a paucity of longitudinal research investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation on the brain of MDD patients. Methods. We conducted a double-blind randomized controlled trial in 46 MDD patients, who were randomly allocated into either VD (antidepressant medication + vitamin D supplementation) or NVD (antidepressant medication + placebos) groups. Data from diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional MRI, serum vitamin D concentration, and clinical symptoms were obtained at baseline and after an average of 7 months of intervention. Results. Both VD and NVD groups showed significant improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms but with no significant differences between the two groups. However, a greater increase in serum vitamin D concentration was found to be associated with greater improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms in VD group. More importantly, neuroimaging data demonstrated disrupted white matter integrity of right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus along with decreased functional connectivity between right frontoparietal and medial visual networks after intervention in NVD group, but no changes in VD group. Conclusions. These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants may not only contribute to improvement in clinical symptoms but also help preserve brain structural and functional connectivity in MDD patients. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

This study investigates the dynamic coactivation patterns (CAPs) associated with the substantia nigra (SN), a key dopaminergic nucleus, in first-episode treatment-naïve patients with schizophrenia (FES). Methods Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 84 FES and 94 healthy controls (HCs). Frame-wise clustering was implemented to generate CAPs related to SN activation or deactivation. Connectome features of each CAP were derived using an edge-centric method. The occurrence for each CAP and the balance ratio for antagonistic CAPs were calculated and compared between two groups, and correlations between temporal dynamic metrics and symptom burdens were explored. Results Functional reconfigurations in CAPs exhibited significant differences between the activation and deactivation states of SN. During SN activation, FES more frequently recruited a CAP characterized by activated default network, language network, control network, and the caudate, compared to HCs (F = 8.54, FDR-p = 0.030). Moreover, FES displayed a tilted balance towards a CAP featuring SN-coactivation with the control network, caudate, and thalamus, as opposed to its antagonistic CAP (F = 7.48, FDR-p = 0.030). During SN deactivation, FES exhibited increased recruitment of a CAP with activated visual and dorsal attention networks but decreased recruitment of its opposing CAP (F = 6.58, FDR-p = 0.034). Conclusion Our results suggest that neuroregulatory dysfunction in dopaminergic pathways involving SN potentially mediates aberrant time-varying functional reorganizations in schizophrenia. This finding enriches the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia from the perspective of brain dynamics. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

There is a clear demand for innovative therapeutics for bipolar disorder (BD). Methods. We integrated the largest BD genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset (NCase = 41 917, NControl = 371 549) with protein quantitative trait loci from brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and plasma. Using a range of integrative analyses, including Mendelian randomization (MR), Steiger filter analysis, Bayesian colocalization, and phenome-wide MR analysis, we prioritized novel drug targets for BD. Additionally, we incorporated data from the UK Biobank (NCase = 1064, NControl = 365 476) and the FinnGen study (NCase = 7006, NControl = 329 192) for robust biological validation. Results. Through MR analysis, we found that in the brain, downregulation of DNM3, MCTP1, ABCB8 and elevation of DFNA5 and PDF were risk factors for BD. In cerebrospinal fluid, increased BD risk was associated with increased levels of FRZB, AGRP, and IL36A and decreased CTSF and LRP8. Plasma analysis revealed that decreased LMAN2L, CX3CL1, PI3, NCAM1, and TIMP4 correlated with increased BD risk, but ITIH1 did not. All these proteins passed Steiger filtering, and Bayesian colocalization confirmed that 12 proteins were colocalized with BD. Phenome-wide MR analysis revealed no significant side effects for potential drug targets, except for LRP8. External validation further underscored the concordance between the primary and validation cohorts, confirming MCTP1, DNM3, PDF, CTSF, AGRP, FRZB, LMAN2L, NCAM1, and TIMP4 are intriguing targets for BD. Conclusions. Our study identified druggable proteins for BD, including MCTP1, DNM3, and PDF in the brain; CTSF, AGRP, and FRZB in cerebrospinal fluid; and LMAN2L, NCAM1, and TIMP4 in plasma, delineating promising avenues to development of novel therapies. © The Author(s), 2024.

This phenotypic heterogeneity might reflect underlying genetic heterogeneity. At the same time, overlapping characteristics between BD and other psychiatric illnesses are observed at clinical and biomarker levels, which implies a shared biological mechanism between them. Incorporating these two issues in a single study design, this study investigated whether phenotypically heterogeneous subtypes of BD have a distinct polygenic basis shared with other psychiatric illnesses. Methods Six lifetime phenotype dimensions of BD identified in our previous study were used as target phenotypes. Associations between these phenotype dimensions and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of major psychiatric illnesses from East Asian (EA) and other available populations were analyzed. Results Each phenotype dimension showed a different association pattern with PRSs of mental illnesses. PRS for EA schizophrenia showed a significant negative association with the cyclicity dimension (p = 0.044) but a significant positive association with the psychotic/irritable mania dimension (p = 0.001). PRS of EA major depressive disorder demonstrated a significant negative association with the elation dimension (p = 0.003) but a significant positive association with the comorbidity dimension (p = 0.028). Conclusion This study demonstrates that well-defined phenotype dimensions of lifetime-basis in BD have distinct genetic risks shared with other major mental illnesses. This finding supports genetic heterogeneity in BD and suggests a pleiotropy among BD subtypes and other psychiatric disorders beyond BD. Further genomic analyses adopting deep phenotyping across mental illnesses in ancestrally diverse populations are warranted to clarify intra-diagnosis heterogeneity and inter-diagnoses commonality issues in psychiatry.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most prevalent and disabling illnesses worldwide. Treatment of MDD typically relies on trial-and-error to find an effective approach. Identifying early response-related biomarkers that predict response to antidepressants would help clinicians to decide, as early as possible, whether a particular treatment might be suitable for a given patient. Methods. Data were from the two-stage Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) trial. A whole-brain, voxel-wise, mixed-effects model was applied to identify early-treatment cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes as biomarkers of treatment response. We examined changes in CBF measured with arterial spin labeling 1-week after initiating double-masked sertraline/placebo. We tested whether these early 1-week scans could be used to predict response observed after 8-weeks of treatment. Results. Response to 8-week placebo treatment was associated with increased cerebral perfusion in temporal cortex and reduced cerebral perfusion in postcentral region captured at 1-week of treatment. Additionally, CBF response in these brain regions was significantly correlated with improvement in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score in the placebo group. No significant associations were found for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment. Conclusions. We conclude that early CBF responses to placebo administration in multiple brain regions represent candidate neural biomarkers of longer-term antidepressant effects. © The Author(s), 2024.

Studies investigating parenthood and how it affects long-term outcomes are lacking among individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This study aimed to examine the life of participants 20 years after their first diagnosis with a special focus on parenthood, clinical illness course, and family-related outcomes. Methods. Among 578 individuals diagnosed with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorder between 1998 and 2000, a sample of 174 participants was reassessed at the 20-year follow-up. We compared symptom severity, remission, clinical recovery, and global functioning between 75 parents and 99 non-parents. Also, family functioning scored on the family assessment device, and the children’s mental health was reported. We collected longitudinal data on psychiatric admission, supported housing, and work status via the Danish registers. Results. Participants with offspring had significantly lower psychotic (mean (S.D.) of 0.89 (1.46) v. 1.37 (1.44), p = 0.031) negative (mean [S.D.] of 1.13 [1.16] v. 1.91 [1.07], p < 0.001) and disorganized symptom scores (mean [S.D.] of 0.46 [0.80] v. 0.85 [0.95], p = 0.005) and more were in remission (59.5% v. 22.4%, p < 0.001) and in clinical recovery (29.7% v. 11.1%, p = 0.002) compared to non-parents. When investigating global functioning over 20 years, individuals becoming parents after their first diagnosis scored higher than individuals becoming parents before their first diagnosis and non-parents. Regarding family-related outcomes, 28.6% reported unhealthy family functioning, and 10% of the children experienced daily life difficulties. Conclusions. Overall, parents have more favorable long-term outcomes than non-parents. Still, parents experience possible challenges regarding family functioning, and a minority of their children face difficulties in daily life. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Approximately 90% of VA patients that go on to die by suicide do not meet these high-risk criteria and therefore do not receive targeted suicide prevention services. In this study, we used national VA data to focus on patients that were not classified as high-risk, but died by suicide. Methods Our sample included all VA patients who died by suicide in 2017 or 2018. We determined whether patients were classified as high-risk using the VA's machine learning risk prediction algorithm. After excluding these patients, we used principal component analysis to identify moderate-risk and low-risk patients and investigated demographics, service-usage, diagnoses, and social determinants of health differences across high-, moderate-, and low-risk subgroups. Results High-risk (n = 452) patients tended to be younger, White, unmarried, homeless, and have more mental health diagnoses compared to moderate- (n = 2149) and low-risk (n = 2209) patients. Moderate- and low-risk patients tended to be older, married, Black, and Native American or Pacific Islander, and have more physical health diagnoses compared to high-risk patients. Low-risk patients had more missing data than higher-risk patients. Conclusions Study expands epidemiological understanding about non-high-risk suicide decedents, historically understudied and underserved populations. Findings raise concerns about reliance on machine learning risk prediction models that may be biased by relative underrepresentation of racial/ethnic minorities within health system.

Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, contribute to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to identify novel MDD-associated epigenetic loci using DNA methylation profiles and explore the correlations between epigenetic loci and cortical thickness changes in patients with MDD. Methods. A total of 350 patients with MDD and 161 healthy controls (HCs) were included in the epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). We analyzed methylation, copy number alteration (CNA), and gene network profiles in the MDD group. A total of 234 patients with MDD and 135 HCs were included in neuroimaging methylation analysis. Pearson’s partial correlation analysis was used to estimate the correlation between cortical thickness of brain regions and DNA methylation levels of the loci. Results. In total, 2018 differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and 351 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified. DMP-related genes were enriched in two networks involved in the central nervous system. In neuroimaging analysis, patients with MDD showed cortical thinning in the prefrontal regions and cortical thickening in several occipital regions. Cortical thickness of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC, i.e. pars triangularis) was negatively correlated with eight DMPs associated with six genes (EML6, ZFP64, CLSTN3, KCNMA1, TAOK2, and NT5E). Conclusion. Through combining DNA methylation and neuroimaging analyses, negative correlations were identified between the cortical thickness of the left VLPFC and DNA methylation levels of eight DMPs. Our findings could improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of MDD. © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Methods Using eIMPACT trial data, we examined the effect of modernized collaborative care for depression on indicators of CVD risk. A total of 216 primary care patients with depression and elevated CVD risk were randomized to 12 months of the eIMPACT intervention (internet cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT], telephonic CBT, and select antidepressant medications) or usual primary care. CVD-relevant health behaviors (self-reported CVD prevention medication adherence, sedentary behavior, and sleep quality) and traditional CVD risk factors (blood pressure and lipid fractions) were assessed over 12 months. Incident CVD events were tracked over four years using a statewide health information exchange. Results The intervention group exhibited greater improvement in depressive symptoms (p < 0.01) and sleep quality (p < 0.01) than the usual care group, but there was no intervention effect on systolic blood pressure (p = 0.36), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.38), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.79), triglycerides (p = 0.76), CVD prevention medication adherence (p = 0.64), or sedentary behavior (p = 0.57). There was an intervention effect on diastolic blood pressure that favored the usual care group (p = 0.02). The likelihood of an incident CVD event did not differ between the intervention (13/107, 12.1%) and usual care (9/109, 8.3%) groups (p = 0.39). Conclusions Successful depression treatment alone is not sufficient to lower the heightened CVD risk of people with depression. Alternative approaches are needed.

Knowledge on latent classes and transitions between these classes over time based on longitudinal disorder status information provides insight into clustering of meaningful groups with different disease prognosis. Methods Data of all four waves of the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 were used, a representative population-based study of adults (mean duration between two successive waves = 3 years; N at T0 = 6646; T1 = 5303; T2 = 4618; T3 = 4007; this results in a total number of data points: 20 574). Presence of eight mood and anxiety DSM-IV disorders was assessed with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Latent class analysis and latent Markov modelling were used. Results The best fitting model identified four classes: A healthy class (prevalence: 94.1%), depressed-worried class (3.6%; moderate-To-high proportions of mood disorders and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)), fear class (1.8%; moderate-To-high proportions of panic and phobia disorders) and high comorbidity class (0.6%). In longitudinal analyses over a three-year period, the minority of those in the depressed-worried and high comorbidity class persisted in their class over time (36.5% and 38.4%, respectively), whereas the majority in the fear class did (67.3%).

We examined whether a family of schizophrenia spectrum disorder (FH-Sz) interacts with an environmental risk score (ERS-Sz) regarding the outcome of patients with non-affective first episode psychosis (NAFEP). Methods: We included 288 patients with NAFEP who were evaluated after discharge from an intensive 2-year program. We evaluated three outcome measures: symptomatic remission, psychosocial functioning, and personal recovery. We analyzed the main and joint associations of a FH-Sz and the ERS-Sz on the outcomes by using the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) approach. Results: A FH-Sz showed a significant association with poor symptomatic remission and psychosocial functioning outcomes, although there was no significant interaction between a FH-Sz and the ERS-Sz on these outcomes. The ERS-Sz did not show a significant association with poor symptomatic remission and psychosocial functioning outcomes, even though the magnitude of the interaction between ERS-Sz and FH-Sz with the later outcome was moderate (RERI = 6.89, 95% confidence interval -16.03 to 29.81). There was no association between a FH-Sz and the ERS-Sz and personal recovery.

We used family designs and T2DM polygenic risk score (T2DM-PRS) to investigate the genetic associations between psychiatric disorders and T2DM. Methods We linked 659 906 individuals born in Denmark 1990-2000 to their parents, grandparents, and aunts/uncles using population-based registers. We compared rates of T2DM in relatives of children with and without a diagnosis of any or one of 11 specific psychiatric disorders, including neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, using Cox regression. In a genotyped sample (iPSYCH2015) of individuals born 1981-2008 (n = 134 403), we used logistic regression to estimate associations between a T2DM-PRS and these psychiatric disorders. Results Among 5 235 300 relative pairs, relatives of individuals with a psychiatric disorder had an increased risk for T2DM with stronger associations for closer relatives (parents:hazard ratio = 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.35-1.42; grandparents: 1.14, 1.13-1.15; and aunts/uncles: 1.19, 1.16-1.22). In the genetic sample, one standard deviation increase in T2DM-PRS was associated with an increased risk for any psychiatric disorder (odds ratio = 1.11, 1.08-1.14). Both familial T2DM and T2DM-PRS were significantly associated with seven of 11 psychiatric disorders, most strongly with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder, and inversely with anorexia nervosa. Conclusions Our findings of familial co-aggregation and higher T2DM polygenic liability associated with psychiatric disorders point toward shared familial risk. This suggests that part of the comorbidity is explained by shared familial risks. The underlying mechanisms still remain largely unknown and the contributions of genetics and environment need further investigation. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

Yet, it is unclear whether these individuals at risk and those diagnosed with BD share similar gray matter brain alterations. Methods: In 410 male and female participants aged 17-35 years, we compared gray matter volume (3T MRI) between individuals at risk for BD (as assessed using the EPIbipolar scale; n = 208), patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of BD (n = 87), and healthy controls (n = 115) using voxel-based morphometry in SPM12/CAT12. We applied conjunction analyses to identify similarities in gray matter volume alterations in individuals at risk and BD patients, relative to healthy controls. We also performed exploratory whole-brain analyses to identify differences in gray matter volume among groups. ComBat was used to harmonize imaging data from seven sites. Results: Both individuals at risk and BD patients showed larger volumes in the right putamen than healthy controls. Furthermore, individuals at risk had smaller volumes in the right inferior occipital gyrus, and BD patients had larger volumes in the left precuneus, compared to healthy controls. These findings were independent of course of illness (number of lifetime manic and depressive episodes, number of hospitalizations), comorbid diagnoses (major depressive disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, eating disorder), familial risk, current disease severity (global functioning, remission status), and current medication intake. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that alterations in the right putamen might constitute a vulnerability marker for BD. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

Methods This study investigated the impact of increasing complexity of CC processing in 140 subjects with psychosis and 39 healthy adults, with assessments of behavioral performance, neural regions of interest and symptom severity. Results The lowest level of CC (Stroop task) was impaired in all patients; the intermediate level of CC (Faces task) with explicit emotional information was most impaired in patients with first episode psychosis. Patients showed activation of distinct neural CC and reward networks, but iterative learning based on the higher-order of CC during the trust game, was most impaired in chronic schizophrenia. Subjects with first episode psychosis, and patients with lower symptom load, demonstrate flexibility of the CC network to facilitate learning, which appeared compromised in the more chronic stages of schizophrenia. Conclusion These data suggest optimal windows for opportunities to introduce therapeutic interventions to improve CC.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

Auditory-based targeted cognitive training (TCT) is a 'bottom up' intervention designed to enhance the speed and accuracy of auditory information processing, which has been shown to improve neurocognition in certain SZ patients. However, the dynamics of TCT learning as a function of training exercises and their impact on neurocognitive functioning and therapeutic outcomes are unknown. Methods Forty subjects (SZ, n = 21; healthy subjects (HS), n = 19) underwent comprehensive clinical, cognitive, and auditory assessments, including measurements of auditory processing speed (APS) at baseline and after 1-h of TCT. SZ patients additionally completed 30-hours of TCT and repeated assessments ∼10-12 weeks later. Results SZ patients were deficient in APS at baseline (d = 0.96, p < 0.005) relative to HS. After 1-h of TCT, analyses revealed significant main effects of diagnosis (d = 1.75, p = 0.002) and time (d = 1.04, p < 0.001), and a diagnosis × time interaction (d = 0.85, p = 0.02) on APS. APS learning effects were robust after 1-h in SZ patients (d = 1.47, p < 0.001) and persisted throughout the 30-h of training. Baseline APS was associated with verbal learning gains after 30-h of TCT (r = 0.51, p = 0.02) in SZ. Conclusions TCT learning metrics may have prognostic utility and aid in the prospective identification of individuals likely to benefit from TCT. Future experimental medicine studies may advance predictive algorithms that enhance TCT-related clinical, cognitive and functional outcomes.  © The Author(s), 2024.

While unemployment is known to increase the risk of suicide, its cumulative effect remains underexplored. This study investigates how unemployment affects suicide mortality and whether the effect varies based on the number of unemployment spells using two years of nationwide data. Methods. Using the data from the National Statistical Office and Employment Insurance Database for 2018 and 2019, we identified an average of 2365 cases of suicide over two years among 7.76 million workers aged 25–64 years who had been employed within one year before their suicide. The number of unemployment spells was counted using the employment history of the past five years. We calculated crude suicide mortality rates per 100 000 population, age- and sex- standardized mortality rates (SMRs), and proportionate mortality rates (PMRs) for suicide. Results. Over the two years, the crude suicide rate was 30.0 per 100 000 among the general population and 30.5 among workers. Workers with no unemployment spells in the past five years had a significantly lower SMR (0.44; 0.42–0.46), while those with four or more unemployment spells had a significantly higher SMR (3.13; 2.92–3.35) than the general population. These findings were consistent across all sex and age groups. Additionally, workers with four or more unemployment spells had a significantly higher PMR than the general population. Conclusion. The impact of unemployment on suicide mortality intensifies as the number of unemployment spells increases. These results underscore the necessity for additional social and psychological support along with economic assistance for individuals facing recurrent unemployment. © The Author(s), 2024.

Genetic studies have been mostly restricted to European settings, with polygenic scores (PGS) demonstrating low portability across diverse global populations. Methods This study examines genetic architecture, polygenic prediction, and socio-environmental correlates of MDD in a family-based sample of 10 032 individuals from Nepal with array genotyping data. We used genome-based restricted maximum likelihood to estimate heritability, applied S-LDXR to estimate the cross-Ancestry genetic correlation between Nepalese and European samples, and modeled PGS trained on a GWAS meta-Analysis of European and East Asian ancestry samples. Results We estimated the narrow-sense heritability of lifetime MDD in Nepal to be 0.26 (95% CI 0.18-0.34, p = 8.5 × 10-6). Our analysis was underpowered to estimate the cross-Ancestry genetic correlation (rg = 0.26, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.81). MDD risk was associated with higher age (beta = 0.071, 95% CI 0.06-0.08), female sex (beta = 0.160, 95% CI 0.15-0.17), and childhood exposure to potentially traumatic events (beta = 0.050, 95% CI 0.03-0.07), while neither the depression PGS (beta = 0.004, 95% CI -0.004 to 0.01) or its interaction with childhood trauma (beta = 0.007, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03) were strongly associated with MDD. Conclusions Estimates of lifetime MDD heritability in this Nepalese sample were similar to previous European ancestry samples, but PGS trained on European data did not predict MDD in this sample. This may be due to differences in ancestry-linked causal variants, differences in depression phenotyping between the training and target data, or setting-specific environmental factors that modulate genetic effects. Additional research among under-represented global populations will ensure equitable translation of genomic findings. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

However, the impact of CA on long-term outcomes of psychotic disorders remains poorly understood. Methods Two hundred and forty-three patients were assessed at their first episode of psychosis for CA and re-assessed after a mean of 21 years of follow-up for several outcome domains, including symptoms, functioning, quality of life, cognitive performance, neurological dysfunction, and comorbidity. The unique predictive ability of CA exposure for outcomes was examined using linear regression analysis controlling for relevant confounders, including socioeconomic status, family risk of schizophrenia, and obstetric complications. Results There were 54% of the patients with a documented history of CA at mild or higher levels. CA experiences were more prevalent and severe in schizophrenia than in other psychotic disorders (p < 0.001). Large to very large effect sizes were observed for CA predicting most role functioning variables and negative symptoms (δR2 between 0.105 and 0.181). Moderate effect sizes were observed for positive symptoms, personal functioning, impaired social cognition, impaired immediate verbal learning, poor global cognition, internalized stigma, poor personal recovery, and drug abuse severity (δR2 between 0.040 and 0.066). A dose-response relationship was observed between levels of CA and severity of outcome domains. Conclusion Our results suggest a strong and widespread link between early adversity exposure and outcomes of psychotic disorders. Awareness of the serious long-term consequences of CA should encourage better identification of those at risk and the development of effective interventions.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

This study examined plasma drug concentrations of a dose-tapering trial which exhibited the potential of successful maintenance under lower antipsychotic dosages. Methods A 2-year open-label randomized prospective trial recruited remitted patients to undergo guided antipsychotic tapering. Blood samples were collected at baseline, annually, and after each dose reduction. Plasma aripiprazole/dehydroaripiprazole concentrations were determined using LC-MS/MS. The relationship between the dose and serum drug levels was examined using Spearman's correlation. Divided at 120 ng/mL, relapse rate, global function, quality of life, and psychopathology were compared between high- and low- drug level groups. Results A total of 126 blood samples were collected, after excluding13 samples due of non-adherence. The correlation coefficients between dosage and drug level were 0.853 (aripiprazole) and 0.864 (dehydroaripiprazole), and the dose and concentration plots were parallel along the tapering trajectories, except patients with non-adherence. The concentration-to-dose ratio of aripiprazole in this cohort, 17.79 ± 7.23 ng/mL/mg, was higher than that in Caucasian populations. No significant differences were observed in the clinical outcomes between the high- and low-level groups. Remarkably, 12 of 15 patients maintained remission at plasma aripiprazole concentrations of <120 ng/mL. Conclusions The lower-than-expected doses reached in our antipsychotic tapering trial were substantiated to provide adequate prophylactic effects by TDM results in a subset of patients treated with aripiprazole, even considering the differences in pharmacogenomics between ethnicities.

We aimed to investigate whether use of antipsychotic medication, benzodiazepines, and psychiatric service use differs among patients with schizophrenia depending on whether psychosis was precipitated by a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder (CUD). Methods We utilized the nationwide Danish registries to identify all individuals with an incident diagnosis of schizophrenia from 1995 to 2016. We also collected information on whether first CUD diagnosis preceded schizophrenia and thus defined a group of potentially cannabis-related schizophrenia. We compared the cannabis-related schizophrenia group both with all non-cannabis-related patients with schizophrenia and with non-cannabis-related patients with schizophrenia that were propensity-score matched to cases using a range of potentially confounding variables. Results We included 35 714 people with incident schizophrenia, including 4116 (11.5%) that were cannabis-related. In the unmatched-comparison analyses, there were no clear differences over time in use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines related to whether the diagnosis of schizophrenia was cannabis-related. After propensity-score matching, use of antipsychotics and benzodiazepines was significantly lower among cannabis-related cases of schizophrenia. In the unmatched comparison, the cannabis-related group had significantly more days admitted than the non-cannabis-related group. This was markedly attenuated after propensity-score matching. Conclusions Our findings indicate the importance of considering cannabis-related cases of schizophrenia as a potentially distinct disorder in terms of prognosis. It is unclear, however, if these differences are due to different biological types of schizophrenia being compared or if they rather indicate behavioral differences such as reduced adherence and treatment-seeking.

Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are elevated among active-duty service members (ADSM) and veterans compared to the general population. Hence, it is a priority to examine maintenance factors underlying suicidal ideation among ADSM and veterans to develop effective, targeted interventions. In particular, interpersonal risk factors, hopelessness, and overarousal have been robustly connected to suicidal ideation and intent. Methods. To identify the suicidal ideation risk factors that are most relevant, we employed network analysis to examine between-subjects (cross-sectional), contemporaneous (within seconds), and temporal (across four hours) group-level networks of suicidal ideation and related risk factors in a sample of ADSM and veterans (participant n = 92, observations n = 10 650). Participants completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) surveys four times a day for 30 days, where they answered questions related to suicidal ideation, interpersonal risk factors, hopelessness, and overarousal. Results. The between-subjects and contemporaneous networks identified agitation, not feeling close to others, and ineffectiveness as the most central symptoms. The temporal network revealed that feeling ineffective was most likely to influence other symptoms in the network over time. Conclusion. Our findings suggest that ineffectiveness, low belongingness, and agitation are important drivers of moment-to-moment and longitudinal relations between risk factors for suicidal ideation in ADSM and veterans. Targeting these symptoms may disrupt suicidal ideation. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Methods We analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 114 female AN patients and 135 healthy controls (HC) and obtained self-reported psychological scales, including eating disorder examination questionnaire 6.0. One hundred sixty-four cortical, subcortical, cerebellar, and network parcellation regions were considered as ROIs. We calculated the ROI-to-ROI rsFCs and performed group comparisons. Results Compared to HC, AN patients showed 12 stronger rsFCs mainly in regions containing dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and 33 weaker rsFCs primarily in regions containing cerebellum, within temporal lobe, between posterior fusiform cortex and lateral part of visual network, and between anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and thalamus (p < 0.01, false discovery rate [FDR] correction). Comparisons between AN subtypes showed that there were stronger rsFCs between right lingual gyrus and right supracalcarine cortex and between left temporal occipital fusiform cortex and medial part of visual network in the restricting type compared to the binge/purging type (p < 0.01, FDR correction). Conclusion Stronger rsFCs in regions containing mainly DLPFC, and weaker rsFCs in regions containing primarily cerebellum, within temporal lobe, between posterior fusiform cortex and lateral part of visual network, and between ACC and thalamus, may represent categorical diagnostic markers discriminating AN patients from HC.

Adolescents often experience a heightened incidence of depressive symptoms, which can persist without early intervention. However, adolescents often struggle to identify depressive symptoms, and even when they are aware of these symptoms, seeking help is not always their immediate response. This study aimed to explore the relationship between passively collected digital data, specifically keystroke and stylus data collected via mobile devices, and the manifestation of depressive symptoms. Methods. A total of 927 first-year middle school students from schools in Seoul solved Korean language and math problems. Throughout this study, 77 types of keystroke and stylus data were collected, including parameters such as the number of key presses, tap pressure, stroke speed, and stroke acceleration. Depressive symptoms were measured using the self-rated Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results. Multiple regression analysis highlighted the significance of stroke length, speed, and acceleration, the average y-coordinate, the tap pressure, and the number of incorrect answers in relation to PHQ-9 scores. The keystroke and stylus metadata were able to reflect mood, energy, cognitive abilities, and psychomotor symptoms among adolescents with depressive symptoms. Conclusions. This study demonstrates the potential of automatically collected data during school exams or classes for the early screening of clinical depressive symptoms in students. This study has the potential to serve as a cornerstone in the development of digital data frameworks for the early detection of depressive symptoms in adolescents. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

People with intellectual disability have higher rates of ADHD yet there is little evidence on the presentation and pharmacological treatment of ADHD in this population or how this differs from the general population. Methods Retrospective cohort study using data from electronic health records. Adults with intellectual disability newly diagnosed with ADHD between 2007 and 2022 were matched to adults with ADHD without intellectual disability and their clinical features and treatments were compared. Results A total of 159 adults with ADHD and intellectual disability and 648 adults with ADHD without intellectual disability formed the dataset. Adults with intellectual disability had higher rates of psychiatric co-morbidity and spent more time under mental health services than those without intellectual disability. They were more likely to have recorded agitation, aggression, hostility, and mood instability, and less likely to have poor concentration recorded in the 12 months prior to the diagnosis of ADHD. Following diagnosis, people with intellectual disability were significantly less likely to be prescribed any medication for ADHD than controls without intellectual disability (adjusted odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.38-0.91), and were less likely to be prescribed stimulants (27.7% v 46.0%, p < 0.001). Conclusions The presence of behaviors that challenge in adults with intellectual disability may indicate co-occurring ADHD. Further work to define the safety and efficacy of medication for ADHD in adults with intellectual disability is needed to understand differences in prescription rates and to avoid inequities in care outcomes.

This randomized, double-blind, two-arm, parallel-group, sham-controlled clinical trial assessed the efficacy of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) over the RIFG in reducing autistic symptoms (NCT04987749). Methods Conducted at a single medical center, the trial enrolled 60 intellectually able autistic individuals (aged 8-30 years; 30 active iTBS). The intervention comprised 16 sessions (two stimulations per week for eight weeks) of neuro-navigated iTBS or sham over the RIFG. Fifty-seven participants (28 active) completed the intervention and assessments at Week 8 (the primary endpoint) and follow-up at Week 12. Results Autistic symptoms (primary outcome) based on the Social Responsiveness Scale decreased in both groups (significant time effect), but there was no significant difference between groups (null time-by-treatment interaction). Likewise, there was no significant between-group difference in changes in repetitive behaviors and exploratory outcomes of adaptive function and emotion dysregulation. Changes in social cognition (secondary outcome) differed between groups in feeling scores on the Frith-Happe Animations (Week 8, p = 0.026; Week 12, p = 0.025). Post-hoc analysis showed that the active group improved better on this social cognition than the sham group. Dropout rates did not vary between groups; the most common adverse event in both groups was local pain. Notably, our findings would not survive stringent multiple comparison corrections. Conclusions Our findings suggest that iTBS over the RIFG is not different from sham in reducing autistic symptoms and emotion dysregulation. Nonetheless, RIFG iTBS may improve social cognition of mentalizing others' feelings in autistic individuals. © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

This study therefore aimed to (1) discriminate between different facets of social relationships by means of factor analysis, (2) examine their associations with dementia risk, and (3) assess mediation by depressive symptoms. Methods Thirty-six items from questionnaires on social relationships administered in Wave 2 (2004/2005) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (n = 7536) were used for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Factors were then used as predictors in Cox proportional hazard models with dementia until Wave 9 as outcome, adjusted for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors. Structural equation modeling tested mediation by depressive symptoms through effect decomposition. Results Factor analyses identified six social factors. Across a median follow-up time of 11.8 years (IQR = 5.9-13.9 years), 501 people developed dementia. Higher factor scores for frequency and quality of contact with children (HR = 0.88; p = 0.021) and more frequent social activity engagement (HR = 0.84; p < 0.001) were associated with lower dementia risk. Likewise, higher factor scores for loneliness (HR = 1.13; p = 0.011) and negative experiences of social support (HR = 1.10; p = 0.047) were associated with higher dementia risk. Mediation analyses showed a significant partial effect mediation by depressive symptoms for all four factors. Additional analyses provided little evidence for reverse causation. Conclusions Frequency and quality of social contacts, social activity engagement, and feelings of loneliness are associated with dementia risk and might be suitable targets for dementia prevention programs, partly by lowering depressive symptoms.

Dysmyelination could be part of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia spectrum (SCZ) and bipolar disorders (BPD), yet few studies have examined myelination of the cerebral cortex. The ratio of T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI) correlates with intracortical myelin. We investigated the T1w/T2w-ratio and its age trajectories in patients and healthy controls (CTR) and explored associations with antipsychotic medication use and psychotic symptoms. Methods. Patients with SCZ (n = 64; mean age = 30.4 years, S.D. = 9.8), BPD (n = 91; mean age 31.0 years, S.D. = 10.2), and CTR (n = 155; mean age = 31.9 years, S.D. = 9.1) who participated in the TOP study (NORMENT, University of Oslo, Norway) were clinically assessed and scanned using a General Electric 3 T MRI system. T1w/T2w-ratio images were computed using an optimized pipeline with intensity normalization and field inhomogeneity correction. Vertex-wise regression models were used to compare groups and examine group × age interactions. In regions showing significant differences, we explored associations with antipsychotic medication use and psychotic symptoms. Results. No main effect of diagnosis was found. However, age slopes of the T1w/T2w-ratio differed significantly between SCZ and CTR, predominantly in frontal and temporal lobe regions: Lower T1w/T2w-ratio values with higher age were found in CTR, but not in SCZ. Follow-up analyses revealed a more positive age slope in patients who were using antipsychotics and patients using higher chlorpromazine-equivalent doses. Conclusions. While we found no evidence of reduced intracortical myelin in SCZ or BPD relative to CTR, different regional age trajectories in SCZ may suggest a promyelinating effect of antipsychotic medication. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Diverse symptomatic and functional outcomes can be distinguished and achieving one outcome may mean achieving another, but not necessarily the other way round, which is difficult to disentangle with cross-sectional data. The present study's goal was to evaluate implicative relationships between diverse functional outcomes to better understand their reciprocal dependencies in a cross-sectional design, by using statistical implication analysis (SIA). Methods Early psychosis patients of an early intervention program were evaluated for different outcomes (symptomatic response, functional recovery, and working/living independently) after 36 months of treatment. To determine which positive outcomes implied other positive outcomes, SIA was conducted by using the Iota statistical implication index, a newly developed approach allowing to measure asymmetrical bidirectional relationships between outcomes. Results Two hundred and nineteen recent onset patients with early psychosis were assessed. Results at the end of the three-years in TIPP showed that working independently statistically implied achieving all other outcomes. Symptomatic and functional recovery reciprocally implied one another. Living independently weakly implied symptomatic and functional recovery and did not imply independent working. Conclusions The concept of implication is an interesting way of evaluating dependencies between outcomes as it allows us to overcome the tendency to presume symmetrical relationships between them. We argue that a better understanding of reciprocal dependencies within psychopathology can provide an impetus to tailormade treatments and SIA is a useful tool to address this issue in cross-sectional designs.

However, little is known about how pharmacological action is related to cognitive and affective processes. Here, we examine whether specific reinforcement learning processes mediate the treatment effects of SSRIs. Methods The PANDA trial was a multicentre, double-blind, randomized clinical trial in UK primary care comparing the SSRI sertraline with placebo for depression and anxiety. Participants (N = 655) performed an affective Go/NoGo task three times during the trial and computational models were used to infer reinforcement learning processes. Results There was poor task performance: only 54% of the task runs were informative, with more informative task runs in the placebo than in the active group. There was no evidence for the preregistered hypothesis that Pavlovian inhibition was affected by sertraline. Exploratory analyses revealed that in the sertraline group, early increases in Pavlovian inhibition were associated with improvements in depression after 12 weeks. Furthermore, sertraline increased how fast participants learned from losses and faster learning from losses was associated with more severe generalized anxiety symptoms. Conclusions The study findings indicate a relationship between aversive reinforcement learning mechanisms and aspects of depression, anxiety, and SSRI treatment, but these relationships did not align with the initial hypotheses. Poor task performance limits the interpretability and likely generalizability of the findings, and highlights the critical importance of developing acceptable and reliable tasks for use in clinical studies.

Specifically, existing theories posit that childhood experiences involving childhood trauma are associated with altered fear learning processes, while experiences involving deprivation are not. Several studies have found altered fear acquisition in youth exposed to trauma, but not deprivation, although the specific patterns have varied across studies. The present study utilizes a longitudinal sample of children with variability in adversity experiences to examine associations among childhood trauma, fear learning, and psychopathology in youth. Methods The sample includes 170 youths aged 10-13 years (M = 11.56, s.d. = 0.47, 48.24% female). Children completed a fear conditioning task while skin conductance responses (SCR) were obtained, which included both acquisition and extinction. Childhood trauma and deprivation severity were measured using both parent and youth report. Symptoms of anxiety, externalizing problems, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed at baseline and again two-years later. Results Greater trauma-related experiences were associated with greater SCR to the threat cue (CS+) relative to the safety cue (CS-) in early fear acquisition, controlling for deprivation, age, and sex. Deprivation was unrelated to fear learning. Greater SCR to the threat cue during early acquisition was associated with increased PTSD symptoms over time controlling for baseline symptoms and mediated the relationship between trauma and prospective changes in PTSD symptoms. Conclusions Childhood trauma is associated with altered fear learning in youth, which may be one mechanism linking exposure to violence with the emergence of PTSD symptoms in adolescence.

Timely outpatient follow-up and readmission after discharge are common quality indicators in psychiatric care, but their association varies in previous research. We aimed to examine whether the impact of outpatient follow-up and other factors on readmission risk evolves over time in people with non-affective psychotic disorder (NAP). Methods. The Finnish Quality of Care Register includes all people diagnosed with NAP since January 2010. Here, we followed patients with a hospital discharge between 2017 and 2021 until readmission, death, or up to 365 days. Time of the first outpatient follow-up appointment, length of stay (LOS), number of previous hospitalizations, psychosis diagnosis, substance use disorder (SUD), residential status, economic activity, gender, age, year, and region were included. Follow-up time was divided into five periods: week 1, weeks 2–4, weeks 5–13, weeks 14–25, and weeks 26–52, and each period was analyzed separately with Cox regression. Results. Of the 29 858 discharged individuals, 54.1% had an outpatient follow-up within a week. A total of 10 623 (35.6%) individuals were readmitted. Short LOS increased the readmission risk in the first four weeks, whereas lack of outpatient follow-up raised the risk (adjusted HRs between 1.15 (95% CI 1.04–1.26) and 1.53 (1.37–1.71) in weeks 5–52. The number of previous hospitalizations remained a consistent risk factor throughout the follow-up, while SUD increased risk after 4 weeks and living without family after 13 weeks. Conclusions. Risk factors of readmission vary over time. These temporal patterns must be considered when developing outpatient treatment programs. © The Author(s), 2024.

However, little is known about the relationship between subtypes of trauma and specific symptoms in patients, their siblings, and controls. It is also not clear which variables mediate the relationship between trauma and psychotic symptoms. Methods Seven hundred and forty-two patients with SCZ, 718 of their unaffected siblings and 1039 controls from three EU-GEI sites were assessed for CT, symptom severity, and cognitive schemas about self/others. CT was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and cognitive schemas were assessed by The Brief Core Schema Scale. Results Patients with psychosis were affected by CT more than their siblings and controls in all domains. Childhood emotional abuse and neglect were more common in siblings than controls. CT was related to negative cognitive schemas toward self/others in patients, siblings, and controls. We found that negative schemas about self-mediated the relationship between emotional abuse and thought withdrawal and thought broadcasting. Approximately 33.9% of the variance in these symptoms was explained by the mediator. It also mediated the relationship between sexual abuse and persecutory delusions in SCZ. Conclusions Our findings suggest that childhood abuse and neglect are more common in patients with schizophrenia than their siblings and healthy controls, and have different impacts on clinical domains which we searched. The relationship between CT and positive symptoms seems to be mediated by negative cognitive schemas about self in schizophrenia.  © The Author(s), 2024.

However, its capability to screen for mental disorders in a population-based sample and the impact of adverbial framings (intensity and frequency) on its performance are unknown. Methods The study was based on cross-sectional data from the 1993 Pelotas birth cohort in Brazil. Participants with completed DSM-XC and structured diagnostic interviews (n = 3578, aged 22, 53.6% females) were included. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (LR+), and negative (LR-) likelihood ratios for each of the 13 DSM-XC domains were estimated for detecting five internalizing disorders (bipolar, generalized anxiety, major depressive, post-traumatic stress, and social anxiety disorders) and three externalizing disorders (antisocial personality, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and alcohol use disorders). Sensitivities and specificities >0.75, LR+ > 2 and LR- < 0.5 were considered meaningful. Values were calculated for the DSM-XC's original scoring and for adverbial framings. Results Several DSM-XC domains demonstrated meaningful screening properties. The anxiety domain exhibited acceptable sensitivity and LR- values for all internalizing disorders. The suicidal ideation, psychosis, memory, repetitive thoughts and behaviors, and dissociation domains displayed acceptable specificity for all disorders. Domains also yielded small but meaningful LR+ values for internalizing disorders. However, LR+ and LR- values were not generally meaningful for externalizing disorders. Frequency-framed questions improved screening properties. Conclusions The DSM-XC domains showed transdiagnostic screening properties, providing small but meaningful changes in the likelihood of internalizing disorders in the community, which can be improved by asking frequency of symptoms compared to intensity. The DSM-XC is currently lacking meaningful domains for externalizing disorders.  © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Comorbid depression substantially affects the management of glycemia and diabetes-related complications among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, we sought to determine the association between weight change over 4 years and depression risk among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods. This population-based retrospective cohort study from the National Health Insurance Services of Korea included 1 111 345 patients with type 2 diabetes who were divided into groups according to body weight change over 4 years. Body weight changes were compared with the preceding 4-year period (2005-2008). Depression was defined according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th revision code for depression (F32 and F33) on one or more inpatient or outpatient claims. Results. During a median follow-up of 7.4 years, 244 081 cases of depression were identified. We observed a U-shaped association between body weight change and depression risk with a higher risk among both groups of weight loss (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17, 95% CI 1.15-1.19 for ≥ -10%; HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.06-1.08 for -10 to -5%) and weight gain (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04- 1.08 for ≥10%; HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04 for 5-10%) compared with the stable weight group (-5 to 5%). Conclusions. A U-shaped association between body weight change and depression risk was observed in this large nationwide cohort study. Our study suggests that patients with type 2 diabetes and weight change, either gain or loss, could be considered a high-risk group for depression. © 2024 Cambridge University Press.

Recently, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has increased our understanding of factors associated with real-time suicidal ideation, as well as those predicting ideation at the level of hours and days. Here we used statistical network methods to investigate which cognitive-affective risk and protective factors are associated with the temporal dynamics of suicidal ideation. Methods The SAFE study is a longitudinal cohort study of 82 participants with current suicidal ideation who completed 4×/day EMA over 21 days. We modeled contemporaneous (t) and temporal (t + 1) associations of three suicidal ideation components (passive ideation, active ideation, and acquired capability) and their predictors (positive and negative affect, anxiety, hopelessness, loneliness, burdensomeness, and optimism) using multilevel vector auto-regression models. Results Contemporaneously, passive suicidal ideation was positively associated with sadness, hopelessness, loneliness, and burdensomeness, and negatively with happiness, calmness, and optimism; active suicidal ideation was positively associated with passive suicidal ideation, sadness, and shame; and acquired capability only with passive and active suicidal ideation. Acquired capability and hopelessness positively predicted passive ideation at t + 1, which in turn predicted active ideation; acquired capability was positively predicted at t + 1 by shame, and negatively by burdensomeness. Conclusions Our findings show that systematic real-time associations exist between suicidal ideation and its predictors, and that different factors may uniquely influence distinct components of ideation. These factors may represent important targets for safety planning and risk detection. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We examined such changes following selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and attention bias modification (ABM) variant - gaze-contingent music reward therapy (GC-MRT), a first-line and an emerging treatments for SAD. Methods Eighty-one patients with SAD were allocated to 12-week treatments of either SSRI or GC-MRT, or waitlist (ns = 22, 29, and 30, respectively). Baseline and post-treatment functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected during a social-threat processing task, in which attention was directed toward and away from threat/neutral faces. Results Patients who received GC-MRT or SSRI showed greater clinical improvement relative to patients in waitlist. Compared to waitlist patients, treated patients showed greater activation increase in the right inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex when instructed to attend toward social threats and away from neutral stimuli. An additional anterior cingulate cortex cluster differentiated between the two active groups. Activation in this region increased in ABM and decreased in SSRI. In the ABM group, symptom change was positively correlated with neural activation change in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Conclusions Brain function measures show both shared and treatment-specific changes following ABM and SSRI treatments for SAD, highlighting the multiple pathways through which the two treatments might work. Treatment-specific neural responses suggest that patients with SAD who do not fully benefit from SSRI or ABM may potentially benefit from the alternative treatment, or from a combination of the two.

We aimed to examine the mediating role of several health behaviors in the associations among depression, anxiety, and the incidence of various cancer types (overall, breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, smoking-related, and alcohol-related cancers). Methods Two-stage individual participant data meta-analyses were performed based on 18 cohorts within the Psychosocial Factors and Cancer Incidence consortium that had a measure of depression or anxiety (N = 319 613, cancer incidence = 25 803). Health behaviors included smoking, physical inactivity, alcohol use, body mass index (BMI), sedentary behavior, and sleep duration and quality. In stage one, path-specific regression estimates were obtained in each cohort. In stage two, cohort-specific estimates were pooled using random-effects multivariate meta-analysis, and natural indirect effects (i.e. mediating effects) were calculated as hazard ratios (HRs). Results Smoking (HRs range 1.04-1.10) and physical inactivity (HRs range 1.01-1.02) significantly mediated the associations among depression, anxiety, and lung cancer. Smoking was also a mediator for smoking-related cancers (HRs range 1.03-1.06). There was mediation by health behaviors, especially smoking, physical inactivity, alcohol use, and a higher BMI, in the associations among depression, anxiety, and overall cancer or other types of cancer, but effects were small (HRs generally below 1.01). Conclusions Smoking constitutes a mediating pathway linking depression and anxiety to lung cancer and smoking-related cancers. Our findings underline the importance of smoking cessation interventions for persons with depression or anxiety.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

While this developmental stage is marked by substantial maturation of the neural circuity involved in threat learning, research directly examining adolescence-specific patterns of neural responding during threat learning is scarce. This study compared adolescents and adults in acquisition and extinction of conditioned threat responses assessed at the cognitive, psychophysiological, and neural levels, focusing on the late positive potential (LPP), an event-related potential (ERP) component indexing emotional valence. Method Sixty-five adults and 63 adolescents completed threat acquisition and extinction, 24 h apart, using the bell conditioning paradigm. Self-reported fear, skin conductance responses (SCR), and ERPs were measured. Results Developmental differences emerged in neural and psychophysiological responses during threat acquisition, with adolescents displaying heightened LPP responses to threat and safety cues as well as heightened threat-specific SCR compared to adults. During extinction, SCR suggested comparable reduction in conditioned threat responses across groups, while LPP revealed incomplete extinction only among adolescents. Finally, age moderated the link between anxiety severity and LPP-assessed extinction, whereby greater anxiety severity was associated with reduced extinction among younger participants. Conclusions In line with developmental theories, adolescence is characterized by a specific age-related difficulty adapting to diminishing emotional significance of prior threats, contributing to heightened vulnerability to anxiety symptoms. Further, LPP appears to be sensitive to developmental differences in threat learning and may thus potentially serve as a useful biomarker in research on adolescents, threat learning, and anxiety.

Altered pace of biological aging, as measured through pubertal timing, is one potential explanatory pathway for this risk. This study examined whether pubertal timing mediated the association between adversity (threat and deprivation) and adolescent mental health problems (internalizing and externalizing), and whether this was moderated by sex. Methods Aims were examined using the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study, a large community sample from the United States. Data were used from three timepoints across the ages of 9-14 years. Latent scores from confirmatory factor analysis operationalized exposure to threat and deprivation. Bayesian mixed-effects regression models tested whether pubertal timing in early adolescence mediated the relationship between adversity exposure and later internalizing and externalizing problems. Sex was examined as a potential moderator of this pathway. Results Both threat and deprivation were associated with later internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Threat, but not deprivation, was associated with earlier pubertal timing, which mediated the association of threat with internalizing and externalizing problems. Sex differences were only observed in the direct association between adversity and internalizing problems, but no such differences were present for mediating pathways. Conclusions Adversity exposure had similar associations with the pace of biological aging (as indexed by pubertal timing) and mental health problems in males and females. However, the association of adversity on pubertal timing appears to depend on the dimension of adversity experienced, with only threat conferring risk of earlier pubertal timing.

We developed an algorithm to identify posts containing suicide-related content on a military-specific social media platform. Methods Publicly-shared social media posts (n = 8449) from a military-specific social media platform were reviewed and labeled by our team for the presence/absence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors and used to train several machine learning models to identify such posts. Results The best performing model was a deep learning (RoBERTa) model that incorporated post text and metadata and detected the presence of suicidal posts with relatively high sensitivity (0.85), specificity (0.96), precision (0.64), F1 score (0.73), and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.84. Compared to non-suicidal posts, suicidal posts were more likely to contain explicit mentions of suicide, descriptions of risk factors (e.g. depression, PTSD) and help-seeking, and first-person singular pronouns. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the feasibility and potential promise of using social media posts to identify at-risk Servicemembers and Veterans. Future work will use this approach to deliver targeted interventions to social media users at risk for suicide.  © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Nodes with the most connections (hubs) are central to efficient brain function. Current findings on structural differences in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) identified using network approaches remain inconsistent, potentially due to small sample sizes. It is still uncertain at what level of the connectome hierarchy differences may exist, and whether they are concentrated in hubs, disrupting fundamental brain connectivity. Methods We utilized two large cohorts, UK Biobank (UKB, N = 5104) and Generation Scotland (GS, N = 725), to investigate MDD case-control differences in brain network properties. Network analysis was done across four hierarchical levels: (1) global, (2) tier (nodes grouped into four tiers based on degree) and rich club (between-hub connections), (3) nodal, and (4) connection. Results In UKB, reductions in network efficiency were observed in MDD cases globally (d = -0.076, pFDR = 0.033), across all tiers (d = -0.069 to -0.079, pFDR = 0.020), and in hubs (d = -0.080 to -0.113, pFDR = 0.013-0.035). No differences in rich club organization and region-to-region connections were identified. The effect sizes and direction for these associations were generally consistent in GS, albeit not significant in our lower-N replication sample. Conclusion Our results suggest that the brain's fundamental rich club structure is similar in MDD cases and controls, but subtle topological differences exist across the brain. Consistent with recent large-scale neuroimaging findings, our findings offer a connectomic perspective on a similar scale and support the idea that minimal differences exist between MDD cases and controls.

The nature of the pathway from conduct disorder (CD) in adolescence to antisocial behavior in adulthood has been debated and the role of certain mediators remains unclear. One perspective is that CD forms part of a general psychopathology dimension, playing a central role in the developmental trajectory. Impairment in reflective functioning (RF), i.e., the capacity to understand one’s own and others’ mental states, may relate to CD, psychopathology, and aggression. Here, we characterized the structure of psychopathology in adult male-offenders and its role, along with RF, in mediating the relationship between CD in their adolescence and current aggression. Methods. A secondary analysis of pre-treatment data from 313 probation-supervised offenders was conducted, and measures of CD symptoms, general and specific psychopathology factors, RF, and aggression were evaluated through clinical interviews and questionnaires. Results. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a bifactor model best fitted the sample’s psychopathology structure, including a general psychopathology factor (p factor) and five specific factors: internalizing, disinhibition, detachment, antagonism, and psychoticism. The structure of RF was fitted to the data using a one-factor model. According to our mediation model, CD significantly predicted the p factor, which was positively linked to RF impairments, resulting in increased aggression. Conclusions. These findings highlight the critical role of a transdiagnostic approach provided by RF and general psychopathology in explaining the link between CD and aggression. Furthermore, they underscore the potential utility of treatments focusing on RF, such as mentalization-based treatment, in mitigating aggression in offenders with diverse psychopathologies. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Although the link between alcohol involvement and behavioral phenotypes (e.g. impulsivity, negative affect, executive function [EF]) is well-established, the directionality of these associations, specificity to stages of alcohol involvement, and extent of shared genetic liability remain unclear. We estimate longitudinal associations between transitions among alcohol milestones, behavioral phenotypes, and indices of genetic risk. Methods. Data came from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (n = 3681; ages 11-36). Alcohol transitions (first: drink, intoxication, alcohol use disorder [AUD] symptom, AUD diagnosis), internalizing, and externalizing phenotypes came from the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism. EF was measured with the Tower of London and Visual Span Tasks. Polygenic scores (PGS) were computed for alcohol-related and behavioral phenotypes. Cox models estimated associations among PGS, behavior, and alcohol milestones. Results. Externalizing phenotypes (e.g. conduct disorder symptoms) were associated with future initiation and drinking problems (hazard ratio (HR)≥1.16). Internalizing (e.g. social anxiety) was associated with hazards for progression from first drink to severe AUD (HR≥1.55). Initiation and AUD were associated with increased hazards for later depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (HR≥1.38), and initiation was associated with increased hazards for future conduct symptoms (HR = 1.60). EF was not associated with alcohol transitions. Drinks per week PGS was linked with increased hazards for alcohol transitions (HR≥1.06). Problematic alcohol use PGS increased hazards for suicidal ideation (HR = 1.20). Conclusions. Behavioral markers of addiction vulnerability precede and follow alcohol transitions, highlighting dynamic, bidirectional relationships between behavior and emerging addiction.  © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

However, the best combinations and species of probiotics have not been identified. The objective of our study was to assess the most effective combinations and components of different probiotics through network meta-analysis. Method A systematic search of four databases, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Embase, was conducted from inception to 11 January 2024. The GRADE framework was used to assess the quality of evidence contributing to each network estimate. Results We deemed 45 trials eligible, these included 4053 participants and 10 types of interventions. The quality of evidence was rated as high or moderate. The NMA revealed that Bifidobacterium exhibited a greater probability of being the optimal probiotic species for improving anxiety symptoms (SMD = -0.80; 95% CI -1.49 to -0.11), followed by Lactobacillus (SMD = -0.49; 95% CI -0.85 to -0.12). In addition, for multiple strains, compared with the other interventions, Lactobacillus + Bifidobacterium (SMD = -0.41; 95% CI -0.73 to -0.10) had a positive effect on depression. Conclusion The NMA revealed that Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium had prominent efficacy in the treatment of individuals with anxiety, depression, and combination of Lactobacillus + Bifidobacterium had a similar effect. With few direct comparisons available between probiotic species, this NMA may be instrumental in shaping the guidelines for probiotic treatment of psychological disorders.

Our objective was to explore the association between indicators of linguistic distance and the risk of psychotic disorders among first-generation migrant groups. Methods Using linked health administrative data, we constructed a retrospective cohort of first-generation migrants to Ontario over a 20-year period (1992-2011). Linguistic distance of the first language was categorized using several approaches, including language family classifications, estimated acquisition time, syntax-based distance scores, and lexical-based distance scores. Incident cases of non-affective psychotic disorder were identified over a 5- to 25-year period. We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) for each language variable, after adjustment for knowledge of English at arrival and other factors. Results Our cohort included 1 863 803 first-generation migrants. Migrants whose first language was in a different language family than English had higher rates of psychotic disorders (IRR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.16), relative to those whose first language was English. Similarly, migrants in the highest quintile of linguistic distance based on lexical similarity had an elevated risk of psychotic disorder (IRR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.24). Adjustment for knowledge of English at arrival had minimal effect on observed estimates. Conclusion We found some evidence that linguistic factors that impair comprehension may play a role in the excess risk of psychosis among migrant groups; however, the magnitude of effect is small and unlikely to fully explain the elevated rates of psychotic disorder across migrant groups.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) v. treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Methods At six Dutch mental health centers, 123 outpatients (18-65 years) with DSM-5 diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and suicidal behavior were randomly assigned to the DBT intervention group (n = 63) or TAU control group (n = 60). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-treatment at 6 months and 12-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were severity of suicidal ideation and frequency of suicide attempts. The severity of depression and social anxiety were secondary outcomes. Results At end-of-treatment, DBT significantly reduced both suicidal ideation (z = -2.24; p = 0.025; b = -4.41; s.e. = 197.0) and suicide attempts (z = -3.15; p = 0.002; IRR = 0.046; s.e. = 0.045) compared to TAU, but lost statistical significance at the 12-month follow-up. Depression severity significantly decreased with DBT (z = -1.99; p = 0.046: b = -2.74; s.e. = 1.37) remaining so at 12 months (z = -2.46; p = 0.014; b = -3.37; s.e. = 1.37). No effects were observed on social anxiety. Severe adverse events included two suicides in the TAU condition.

We aimed to identify individuals with VLOP who develop dementia and DLB and characterize the risk factors for progression. Methods Anonymized data were retrieved from electronic records for individuals with VLOP. Patients developing dementia after psychosis were identified, in addition to those with >2 core features of DLB at the time of dementia or DLB identified by a natural language processing application (NLP-DLB). Demographic factors, Health of the National Outcome Scale (HoNOS) and symptoms at index psychosis were explored as predictors of progression to dementia. Results In 1425 patients with VLOP over 4.29 years (mean) follow up, 197 (13.8%) received a subsequent diagnosis of dementia. Of these, 24.4% (n = 48) had >2 core features of DLB and 6% (n = 12) had NLP-DLB. In cox proportional hazard models, older age and cognitive impairment at the time of psychosis were associated with increased risk of incident dementia. Visual hallucinations and 2+ core features of DLB at index psychosis were associated with increased risk of dementia with 2+ symptoms of DLB but not all-cause dementia. Two or more core features of DLB at index psychosis were associated with 81% specificity and 67% sensitivity for incident NLP-DLB. Conclusions In patients with VLOP who develop dementia, core features of DLB are common. Visual hallucinations or two core features of DLB in VLOP should prompt clinicians to consider DLB and support further investigation.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

This study aimed to examine associations between cognition and psychopathology dimensions in a large youth cohort. Method The sample (N = 9350; age 8-21 years) was drawn from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Data from structured clinical interviews were modeled using bifactor confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), resulting in an overall psychopathology ('p') factor score and six orthogonal psychopathology dimensions: dysphoria/distress, obsessive-compulsive, behavioral/externalizing, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, phobias, and psychosis. Neurocognitive data were aggregated using correlated-traits CFA into five factors: executive functioning, memory, complex cognition, social cognition, and sensorimotor speed. We examined relationships among specific and general psychopathology dimensions and neurocognitive factors. Results The final model showed both overall and specific associations between cognitive functioning and psychopathology, with acceptable fit (CFI = 0.91; TLI = 0.90; RMSEA = 0.024; SRMR = 0.054). Overall psychopathology and most psychopathology dimensions were negatively associated with neurocognitive functioning (phobias [p < 0.0005], behavioral/externalizing [p < 0.0005], attention-deficit/hyperactivity [p < 0.0005], psychosis [p < 0.0005 to p < 0.05]), except for dysphoria/distress and obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which were positively associated with complex cognition (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Conclusion By modeling a broad range of cognitive and psychopathology domains in a large, diverse sample of youth, we found aspects of neurocognitive functioning shared across clinical phenotypes, as well as domain-specific patterns.

Although despair- and cardiometabolic-related mortality are increasing concurrently, it is unclear whether they share common developmental origins. We tested adolescent psychopathology as a potential common origin of midlife diseases of despair and cardiometabolic risk. Methods Participants (N = 4578) were from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a nationally representative cohort followed from adolescence to early midlife. Adolescent psychopathology included depression, anxiety, eating disorders, PTSD, conduct disorder, and ADHD at ages 11-18. Diseases of despair (suicidality, substance misuse, pain, and sleep problems) and cardiometabolic risk (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, high-risk waist circumference, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions) were multi-modally measured at ages 33-43. Results At midlife, adolescents who experienced psychopathology exhibited more indicators of despair-related diseases and cardiometabolic risk (IRRs = 1.67 [1.46-1.87] and 1.13 [1.04-1.21], respectively), even after accounting for demographics, adolescent SES, and adolescent cognitive ability. Associations were evident for internalizing and externalizing conditions, and in a dose-response fashion. In mediation analyses, low education explained little of these associations, but early-adult substance use explained 21.5% of psychopathology's association with despair-related diseases. Midlife despair-related diseases and cardiometabolic risk co-occurred within individuals (IRR = 1.12 [1.08-1.16]). Adolescent psychopathology accounted for 8.3% of this co-occurrence, and 16.7% together with adolescent SES and cognitive ability. Conclusions Adolescent psychopathology precedes both diseases of despair and cardiometabolic risk. Prevention and treatment of psychopathology may mitigate multiple causes of poor midlife health, reducing premature mortality.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

However, depression is a highly heterogeneous condition (i.e. there are more than 200 combinations of DSM-5-TR depressive symptoms to correspond to a depression diagnosis). Limited research to date has taken an empirical approach to see how people cluster together based on their classification of depressive symptoms and whether people in certain classes are more likely to report suicide outcomes than other classes. This analysis leverages the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and examines classes of depressive symptoms to explore differences in suicide-related outcomes by class among adults endorsing depressive symptoms (n = 41 969). Methods We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify classes of individuals' DSM-5 depressive symptoms presentation and then explored differences in suicide-related outcomes (i.e. suicide plans, suicide attempts) by the resulting classes. Results A four-class model was determined to optimize the fit criteria. Class 3 (high depressive symptoms) had significantly greater rates of suicide-related outcomes, followed by class 1 (high depressed mood and moderate worthlessness), with classes 4 and 2 having significantly lower rates of suicide-related outcomes. Conclusions The use of LCA provided valuable findings on the importance of leveraging both a multi-faceted assessment of depressive symptoms to identify cases where a high number of depressive symptoms are endorsed, and review of the specific symptoms endorsed. Worthlessness, in particular, may be of particular value to focus on within the context of suicide prevention. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

However, the degree to which individual patients follow this course is unknown. We characterized trajectories of neuropsychiatric symptoms over 12 months post-TBI. We hypothesized that a substantial proportion of individuals would display trajectories distinct from the group-average course, with some exhibiting less favorable courses. Methods Participants were level 1 trauma center patients with TBI (n = 1943), orthopedic trauma controls (n = 257), and non-injured friend controls (n = 300). Trajectories of six symptom dimensions (Depression, Anxiety, Fear, Sleep, Physical, and Pain) were identified using growth mixture modeling from 2 weeks to 12 months post-injury. Results Depression, Anxiety, Fear, and Physical symptoms displayed three trajectories: Stable-Low (86.2-88.6%), Worsening (5.6-10.9%), and Improving (2.6-6.4%). Among symptomatic trajectories (Worsening, Improving), lower-severity TBI was associated with higher prevalence of elevated symptoms at 2 weeks that steadily resolved over 12 months compared to all other groups, whereas higher-severity TBI was associated with higher prevalence of symptoms that gradually worsened from 3-12 months. Sleep and Pain displayed more variable recovery courses, and the most common trajectory entailed an average level of problems that remained stable over time (Stable-Average; 46.7-82.6%). Symptomatic Sleep and Pain trajectories (Stable-Average, Improving) were more common in traumatically injured groups. Conclusions Findings illustrate the nature and rates of distinct neuropsychiatric symptom trajectories and their relationship to traumatic injuries. Providers may use these results as a referent for gauging typical v. atypical recovery in the first 12 months post-injury. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

However, studies examining the relationships between structure and function yielded heterogeneous and inconclusive results. Recent work has suggested that the structure-function relationship is not uniform throughout the brain but varies across different levels of functional hierarchy. This study aims to investigate changes in structure-function couplings (SFC) and their relevance to antidepressant response in MDD from a functional hierarchical perspective. Methods We compared regional SFC between individuals with MDD (n = 258) and healthy controls (HC, n = 99) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. We also compared antidepressant non-responders (n = 55) and responders (n = 68, defined by a reduction in depressive severity of >50%). To evaluate variations in altered and response-associated SFC across the functional hierarchy, we ranked significantly different regions by their principal gradient values and assessed patterns of increase or decrease along the gradient axis. The principal gradient value, calculated from 219 healthy individuals in the Human Connectome Project, represents a region's position along the principal gradient axis. Results Compared to HC, MDD patients exhibited increased SFC in unimodal regions (lower principal gradient) and decreased SFC in transmodal regions (higher principal gradient) (p < 0.001). Responders primarily had higher SFC in unimodal regions and lower SFC in attentional networks (median principal gradient) (p < 0.001). Conclusions Our findings reveal opposing SFC alterations in low-level unimodal and high-level transmodal networks, underscoring spatial variability in MDD pathology. Moreover, hierarchy-specific antidepressant effects provide valuable insights into predicting treatment outcomes.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

The process for determining appropriate second-step care is often based on clinical intuition and involves a protracted course of trial and error, resulting in substantial patient burden and unnecessary delay in the provision of optimal treatment. To address this problem, we adopt an ensemble machine learning approach to improve prediction accuracy of remission in response to second-step treatments. Method Data were derived from the Level 2 stage of the STAR∗D dataset, which included 1439 patients who were randomized into one of seven different second-step treatment strategies after failing to achieve remission during first-step antidepressant treatment. Ensemble machine learning models, comprising several individual algorithms, were evaluated using nested cross-validation on 155 predictor variables including clinical and demographic measures. Results The ensemble machine learning algorithms exhibited differential classification performance in predicting remission status across the seven second-step treatments. For the full set of predictors, AUC values ranged from 0.51 to 0.82 depending on the second-step treatment type. Predicting remission was most successful for cognitive therapy (AUC = 0.82) and least successful for other medication and combined treatment options (AUCs = 0.51-0.66). Conclusion Ensemble machine learning has potential to predict second-step treatment. In this study, predictive performance varied by type of treatment, with greater accuracy in predicting remission in response to behavioral treatments than to pharmacotherapy interventions. Future directions include considering more informative predictor modalities to enhance prediction of second-step treatment response. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

The dysfunction of default mode network (DMN) is critical for self-referential and emotional mental processes and is implicated in BD. The current study aims to explore the balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, i.e. glutamate and 3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in hubs of the DMN during the euthymic patients with BD (euBD). Method Thirty-four euBD and 55 healthy controls (HC) were recruited to the study. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), glutamate (with PRESS sequence) and GABA levels (with MEGAPRESS sequence) were measured in the medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate cortex (mPFC/ACC) and the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC). Measured concentrations of excitatory glutamate/glutamine (Glx) and inhibitory GABA were used to calculate the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) ratio. Executive and attentional functions were respectively assessed using the Wisconsin card-sorting test and continuous performance test. Results euBD performed worse on attentional function than controls (p = 0.001). Compared to controls, euBD had higher E/I ratios in the PCC (p = 0.023), mainly driven by a higher Glx level in the PCC of euBD (p = 0.002). Only in the BD group, a marginally significant negative association between the mPFC E/I ratio (Glx/GABA) and executive function was observed (p = 0.068). Conclusions Disturbed E/I balance, particularly elevated Glx/GABA ratio in PCC is observed in euBD. The E/I balance in hubs of DMN may serve as potential biomarkers for euBD, which may also contribute to their poorer executive function.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

Few population-based studies have examined trajectories of emotional problems from early childhood to late adolescence or investigated differences in psychiatric and functional outcomes. Methods Using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, n = 8286, 50.4% male), we modeled latent class growth trajectories of emotional problems, using the parent-reported Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire emotional scale (SDQ-E) on seven occasions (4-17 years). Psychiatric outcomes in young adulthood (21-25 years) were major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and self-harm. Functional outcomes were exam attainment, educational/occupational status, and social relationship quality. Results We identified four classes of emotional problems: low (67.0%), decreasing (18.4%), increasing (8.9%), and persistent (5.7%) problems. Compared to those in the low class, individuals with decreasing emotional problems were not at elevated risk of any poor adult outcome. Individuals in the increasing and persistent classes had a greater risk of adult MDD (RR: 1.59 95% CI 1.13-2.26 and RR: 2.25 95% CI 1.49-3.41) and self-harm (RR: 2.37 95% CI 1.91-2.94 and RR: 1.87 95% CI 1.41-2.48), and of impairment in functional domains. Childhood sleep difficulties, irritability, conduct and neurodevelopmental problems, and family adversity were associated with a persistent course of emotional problems. Conclusions Childhood emotional problems were common, but those whose symptoms improved over time were not at increased risk for adverse adult outcomes. In contrast, individuals with persistent or adolescent-increasing emotional problems had a higher risk of mental ill-health and social impairment in young adulthood which was especially pronounced for those with persistent emotional problems.

There is evidence that shame has trauma-like characteristics, suggesting it can be understood within the same conceptual framework as trauma and dissociation. Evidence for causal links among trauma, dissociation, and psychosis thus warrant the investigation of how shame may influence causal mechanisms for psychosis symptoms. Methods This study tested the interaction between dissociation and shame, specifically external shame (feeling shamed by others), in predicting psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) six months later in a general population sample (N = 314). It also tested if social safeness moderates these effects. A longitudinal, online questionnaire design tested a moderation model (dissociation-shame) and a moderated moderation model (adding social safeness), using multiple regressions with bootstrap procedures. Results Although there was no direct effect of dissociation on PLEs six months later, there was a significant interaction effect with shame, controlling for PLEs at baseline. There were complex patterns in the directions of effects: For high-shame-scorers, higher dissociation predicted higher PLE scores, but for low-shame-scorers, higher dissociation predicted lower PLE scores. Social safeness was found to significantly moderate these interaction effects, which were unexpectedly more pronounced in the context of higher social safeness. Conclusions The results demonstrate evidence for an interaction between dissociation and shame on its impact on PLEs, which manifests particularly for those experiencing higher social safeness. This suggests a potential role of social mechanisms in both the etiology and treatment of psychosis, which warrants further testing in clinical populations.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

A subgroup of schizophrenia patients with elevated inflammatory or immune-dysregulation has been reported by previous studies. However, little is known about epigenetic changes in genes related to immune activation in never-treated first-episode patients with schizophrenia (FES) and its consistency with that in treated long-term ill (LTS) patients. Methods In this study, epigenome-wide profiling with a DNA methylation array was applied using blood samples of both FES and LTS patients, as well as their corresponding healthy controls. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and k -means clustering were performed to parse heterogeneity of schizophrenia, and the consistency of subtyping results from two cohorts. was tested. Results This study identified a subtype of patients in FES participants (47.5%) that exhibited widespread methylation level alterations of genes enriched in immune cell activity and a significantly higher proportion of neutrophils. This clustering of FES patients was validated in LTS patients, with high correspondence in epigenetic and clinical features across two cohorts Conclusions In summary, this study demonstrated a subtype of schizophrenia patients across both FES and LTS cohorts, defined by widespread alterations in methylation profile of genes related to immune function and distinguishing clinical features. This finding illustrates the promise of novel treatment strategies targeting immune dysregulation for a subpopulation of schizophrenia patients.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

The aim of this study was to assess metabolomic profiles of 38 acylcarnitines in patients with major depression before and after treatment compared to healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: Metabolomic profiles of 38 plasma short-, medium-, and long-chain acylcarnitines were performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 893 HCs from the VARIETE cohort and 460 depressed patients from the METADAP cohort before and after 6 months of antidepressant treatment. RESULTS: As compared to HCs, depressed patients had lower levels of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines. After 6 months of treatment, increased levels of medium- and long-chain acyl-carnitines were observed that no longer differed from those of controls. Accordingly, several medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines were negatively correlated with depression severity. CONCLUSIONS: These medium- and long-chain acylcarnitine dysregulations argue for mitochondrial dysfunction through fatty acid β-oxidation impairment during major depression.","Article","Scopus"

Additionally, it is unclear whether changes in mental health problems during the pandemic exceed the anticipated increases as children age. This study controls for the linear effect of age in 1399 children, investigating the course of child-reported anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, and inattention symptoms during and after the pandemic, and identifies risk and protective factors that predict these mental health trajectories. Methods Children (51% male; ages 9-11 at the first timepoint) provided mental health ratings at three pandemic timepoints (July-August 2020; March-April 2021; November 2021-January 2022) and one post-pandemic timepoint (January-July 2023). Mothers reported pre-pandemic mental health (2017-2019) and socio-demographic factors. Children reported socio-demographic factors, risk (e.g. screen time, sleep), and resilience (e.g. optimism) factors during the first timepoint. Results Average mental health symptoms increased over time, with more children exceeding clinical cut-offs for poor mental health at each subsequent pandemic timepoint. Growth curve modeling, adjusting for age-related effects, revealed a curvilinear course of mental health symptoms across all domains. Examination of risk and protective factors revealed that pre-existing mental health symptoms and optimism were associated with the course of symptoms. Conclusions After considering age effects, children's mental health follows a curvilinear pattern over time, suggesting an initial decline followed by a rising trend in symptoms post-COVID. These findings underscore the continued need for additional resources and timely, evidence-based mental health prevention and intervention for children.

Studies of migrant groups show neighborhood social composition, such as ethnic density, to be important. This is the first longitudinal study to examine this question for refugees and uses a novel quasi-experimental design. Methods We followed a cohort of 44 033 refugees from being first assigned housing under the Danish dispersal policy, operating from 1986 to 1998, until 2019. This comprised, in effect, a natural experiment whereby the influence of assigned neighborhood could be determined independently of endogenous factors. We examined three aspects of neighborhood social composition: proportion of co-nationals, refugees, and first-generation migrants; and subsequent incidence of different mental disorders. Results Refugees assigned to neighborhoods with fewer co-nationals (lowest v. highest quartile) were more likely to receive a subsequent diagnosis of non-affective psychosis, incident rate ratio (IRR) 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.48), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), IRR 1.21 (95% CI I.05-1.39). A comparable but smaller effect was observed for mood disorders but none observed for stress disorders overall. Neighborhood proportion of refugees was less clearly associated with subsequent mental disorders other than non-affective psychosis, IRR 1.24 (95% CI 1.03-1.50). We found no statistically significant associations with proportion of migrants. Conclusions For refugees, living in a neighborhood with a lower proportion of co-nationals is related to subsequent increased risk of diagnosed mental disorders particularly non-affective psychosis and PTSD.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and burdensome for individuals and society. While there are psychological interventions able to prevent and treat MDD, uptake remains low. To overcome structural and attitudinal barriers, an indirect approach of using online insomnia interventions seems promising because insomnia is less stigmatized, predicts MDD onset, is often comorbid and can outlast MDD treatment. This individual-participant-data meta-Analysis evaluated the potential of the online insomnia intervention GET.ON Recovery as an indirect treatment to reduce depressive symptom severity (DSS) and potential MDD onset across a range of participant characteristics. Methods. Efficacy on depressive symptom outcomes was evaluated using multilevel regression models controlling for baseline severity. To identify potential effect moderators, clinical, sociodemographic, and work-related variables were investigated using univariable moderation and random-forest methodology before developing a multivariable decision tree. Results. IPD were obtained from four of seven eligible studies (N = 561); concentrating on workers with high work-stress. DSS was significantly lower in the intervention group both at post-Assessment (d =-0.71 [95% CI-0.92 to-0.51]) and at follow-up (d =-0.84 [95% CI-1.11 to-0.57]). In the subsample (n = 121) without potential MDD at baseline, there were no significant group differences in onset of potential MDD. Moderation analyses revealed that effects on DSS differed significantly across baseline severity groups with effect sizes between d =-0.48 and-0.87 (post) and d =-0.66 to-0.99 (follow-up), while no other sociodemographic, clinical, or work-related characteristics were significant moderators. Conclusions. An online insomnia intervention is a promising approach to effectively reduce DSS in a preventive and treatment setting. © 2024 Cambridge University Press.

However, current evidence is based heavily on 20th-century data when cannabis was substantially less potent than today. Methods We linked population-based survey data from 2009 to 2012 with records of health services covered under universal healthcare in Ontario, Canada, up to 2018. The cohort included respondents aged 12-24 years at baseline with no prior psychotic disorder (N = 11 363). The primary outcome was days to first hospitalization, ED visit, or outpatient visit related to a psychotic disorder according to validated diagnostic codes. Due to non-proportional hazards, we estimated age-specific hazard ratios during adolescence (12-19 years) and young adulthood (20-33 years). Sensitivity analyses explored alternative model conditions including restricting the outcome to hospitalizations and ED visits to increase specificity. Results Compared to no cannabis use, cannabis use was significantly associated with psychotic disorders during adolescence (aHR = 11.2; 95% CI 4.6-27.3), but not during young adulthood (aHR = 1.3; 95% CI 0.6-2.6). When we restricted the outcome to hospitalizations and ED visits only, the strength of association increased markedly during adolescence (aHR = 26.7; 95% CI 7.7-92.8) but did not change meaningfully during young adulthood (aHR = 1.8; 95% CI 0.6-5.4). Conclusions This study provides new evidence of a strong but age-dependent association between cannabis use and risk of psychotic disorder, consistent with the neurodevelopmental theory that adolescence is a vulnerable time to use cannabis. The strength of association during adolescence was notably greater than in previous studies, possibly reflecting the recent rise in cannabis potency. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

However, the two most influential models make markedly different predictions regarding the underlying mechanism. According to the integrated emotion system theory (IES), aggression reflects impaired processing of social distress cues such as fearful faces. In contrast, the hostile attribution bias (HAB) model explains aggression with a bias to interpret ambiguous expressions as angry. Methods In a set of four experiments, we measured processing of fearful and angry facial expressions (compared to neutral and other expressions) in a sample of 65 male imprisoned violent offenders rated using the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R, Hare, R. D. (1991). The psychopathy checklist-revised. Toronto, ON: Multi-Health Systems) and in 60 age-matched control participants. Results There was no evidence for a fear deficit in violent offenders or for an association of psychopathy or aggression with impaired processing of fearful faces. Similarly, there was no evidence for a perceptual bias for angry faces linked to psychopathy or aggression. However, using highly ambiguous stimuli and requiring explicit labeling of emotions, violent offenders showed a categorization bias for anger and this anger bias correlated with self-reported trait aggression (but not with psychopathy). Conclusions These results add to a growing literature casting doubt on the notion that fear processing is impaired in aggressive individuals and in psychopathy and provide support for the idea that aggression is related to a hostile attribution bias that emerges from later cognitive, post-perceptual processing stages.

We thus examined changes in BED diagnostic status in a prospective, community-based study that was larger and more representative with respect to sex, age of onset, and body mass index (BMI) than prior multi-year prospective studies. Methods Probands and relatives with current DSM-IV BED (n = 156) from a family study of BED ('baseline') were selected for follow-up at 2.5 and 5 years. Probands were required to have BMI > 25 (women) or >27 (men). Diagnostic interviews and questionnaires were administered at all timepoints. Results Of participants with follow-up data (n = 137), 78.1% were female, and 11.7% and 88.3% reported identifying as Black and White, respectively. At baseline, their mean age was 47.2 years, and mean BMI was 36.1. At 2.5 (and 5) years, 61.3% (45.7%), 23.4% (32.6%), and 15.3% (21.7%) of assessed participants exhibited full, sub-threshold, and no BED, respectively. No participants displayed anorexia or bulimia nervosa at follow-up timepoints. Median time to remission (i.e. no BED) exceeded 60 months, and median time to relapse (i.e. sub-threshold or full BED) after remission was 30 months. Two classes of machine learning methods did not consistently outperform random guessing at predicting time to remission from baseline demographic and clinical variables. Conclusions Among community-based adults with higher BMI, BED improves with time, but full remission often takes many years, and relapse is common.  © The Author(s), 2024.

Here, we examined their role in the pathophysiology of clinical outcomes in more chronic, difficult-to-treat forms of MDD. Methods Forty-five people with current MDD who had not responded to ∼2 serotonergic antidepressants (n = 42, meeting pre-defined fMRI minimum quality thresholds) were enrolled and followed up over four months of standard primary care. Prior to medication review, subliminal facial emotion fMRI was used to extract blood-oxygen level-dependent effects for sad v. happy faces from two pre-registered a priori defined regions: bilateral amygdala and dorsal/pregenual anterior cingulate cortex. Clinical outcome was the percentage change on the self-reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (16-item). Results We corroborated our pre-registered hypothesis (NCT04342299) that lower bilateral amygdala activation for sad v. happy faces predicted favorable clinical outcomes (rs[38] = 0.40, p = 0.01). In contrast, there was no effect for dorsal/pregenual anterior cingulate cortex activation (rs[38] = 0.18, p = 0.29), nor when using voxel-based whole-brain analyses (voxel-based Family-Wise Error-corrected p < 0.05). Predictive effects were mainly driven by the right amygdala whose response to happy faces was reduced in patients with higher anxiety levels. Conclusions We confirmed the prediction that a lower amygdala response to negative v. positive facial expressions might be an adaptive neural signature, which predicts subsequent symptom improvement also in difficult-to-treat MDD. Anxiety reduced adaptive amygdala responses.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

The comorbidity between schizophrenia (SCZ) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) observed in epidemiological studies is partially attributed to genetic overlap, but the magnitude of shared genetic components and the causality relationship between them remains unclear. Methods. By leveraging large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for SCZ, IBD, ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn’s disease (CD), we conducted a comprehensive genetic pleiotropic analysis to uncover shared loci, genes, or biological processes between SCZ and each of IBD, UC, and CD, independently. Univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were applied to assess the causality across these two disorders. Results. SCZ genetically correlated with IBD (rg = 0.14, p = 3.65 × 10−9), UC (rg = 0.15, p = 4.88 × 10−8), and CD (rg = 0.12, p = 2.27 × 10−6), all surpassed the Bonferroni correction. Cross-trait meta-analysis identified 64, 52, and 66 significantly independent loci associated with SCZ and IBD, UC, and CD, respectively. Follow-up gene-based analysis found 11 novel pleiotropic genes (KAT5, RABEP1, ELP5, CSNK1G1, etc) in all joint phenotypes. Co-expression and pathway enrichment analysis illustrated those novel genes were mainly involved in core immune-related signal transduction and cerebral disorder-related pathways. In univariable MR, genetic predisposition to SCZ was associated with an increased risk of IBD (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.07–1.15, p = 1.85 × 10−6). Multivariable MR indicated a causal effect of genetic liability to SCZ on IBD risk independent of Actinobacteria (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06–1.16, p = 1.34 × 10−6) or BMI (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04–1.18, p = 1.84 × 10−3). Conclusions. We confirmed a shared genetic basis, pleiotropic loci/genes, and causal relationship between SCZ and IBD, providing novel insights into the biological mechanism and therapeutic targets underlying these two disorders. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

However, clinical observations and research demonstrate ARFID and shape/weight motivations sometimes co-occur. To inform classification, we: (1) derived profiles underlying restriction motivation and examined their validity and (2) described diagnostic characterizations of individuals in each profile to explore whether findings support current diagnostic schemes. We expected, consistent with DSM-5, that profiles would comprise individuals endorsing solely ARFID or restraint (i.e. trying to eat less to control shape/weight) motivations. Methods We applied latent profile analysis to 202 treatment-seeking individuals (ages 10-79 years [M = 26, s.d. = 14], 76% female) with ARFID or a non-ARFID ED, using the Nine-Item ARFID Screen (Picky, Appetite, and Fear subscales) and the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire Restraint subscale as indicators. Results A 5-profile solution emerged: Restraint/ARFID-Mixed (n = 24; 8% [n = 2] with ARFID diagnosis); ARFID-2 (with Picky/Appetite; n = 56; 82% ARFID); ARFID-3 (with Picky/Appetite/Fear; n = 40; 68% ARFID); Restraint (n = 45; 11% ARFID); and Non-Endorsers (n = 37; 2% ARFID). Two profiles comprised individuals endorsing solely ARFID motivations (ARFID-2, ARFID-3) and one comprising solely restraint motivations (Restraint), consistent with DSM-5. However, Restraint/ARFID-Mixed (92% non-ARFID ED diagnoses, comprising 18% of those with non-ARFID ED diagnoses in the full sample) endorsed ARFID and restraint motivations. Conclusions The heterogeneous profiles identified suggest ARFID and restraint motivations for dietary restriction may overlap somewhat and that individuals with non-ARFID EDs can also endorse high ARFID symptoms. Future research should clarify diagnostic boundaries between ARFID and non-ARFID EDs. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

A key area of focus in neurodevelopmental research is to estimate the factors that have maximal influence on the brain and can tip the balance from typical to atypical development. Methods Utilizing a dissimilarity maximization algorithm on the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) of the resting state functional MRI data, we classified subjects from the cVEDA neurodevelopmental cohort (n = 987, aged 6-23 years) into homogeneously patterned DMD (representing typical development in 809 subjects) and heterogeneously patterned DMD (indicative of atypical development in 178 subjects). Results Significant DMD differences were primarily identified in the default mode network (DMN) regions across these groups (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). While the groups were comparable in cognitive performance, the atypical group had more frequent exposure to adversities and faced higher abuses (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Upon evaluating brain-behavior correlations, we found that correlation patterns between adversity and DMN dynamic modes exhibited age-dependent variations for atypical subjects, hinting at differential utilization of the DMN due to chronic adversities. Conclusion Adversities (particularly abuse) maximally influence the DMN during neurodevelopment and lead to the failure in the development of a coherent DMN system. While DMN's integrity is preserved in typical development, the age-dependent variability in atypically developing individuals is contrasting. The flexibility of DMN might be a compensatory mechanism to protect an individual in an abusive environment. However, such adaptability might deprive the neural system of the faculties of normal functioning and may incur long-term effects on the psyche. Copyright © The Author(s), 2024.

This study examined the secondary effects of the personality-targeted substance use preventive program Preventure on aggressive behavior from ages 13 to 20. Methods In total, 339 young people from nine independent schools (M age = 13.03 years, s.d. = 0.47, range = 12-15) who rated highly on one of the four personality traits associated with increased substance use and other emotional/behavioral symptoms (i.e. impulsivity, anxiety sensitivity, sensation seeking, and negative thinking) were included in the analyses (n = 145 in Preventure, n = 194 in control). Self-report assessments were administered at baseline and follow-up (6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5.5, and 7 years). Overall aggression and subtypes of aggressive behaviors (proactive, reactive) were examined using multilevel mixed-effects analysis accounting for school-level clustering. Results Across the 7-year follow-up period, the average yearly reduction in the frequency of aggressive behaviors (b = -0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.64 to -0.20; p < 0.001), reactive aggression (b = -0.22; 95% CI 0.35 to -0.10; p = 0.001), and proactive aggression (b = -0.14; 95% CI -0.23 to -0.05; p = 0.002) was greater for the Preventure group compared to the control group. Conclusions The study suggests a brief personality-targeted intervention may have long-term impacts on aggression among young people; however, this interpretation is limited by imbalance of sex ratios between study groups.

Few studies have explicitly examined the impact of intersecting social disadvantage on long-term employment and financial independence. Methods We applied latent class analysis (LCA) to 20-year longitudinal data from participants with affective and non-affective psychosis (n = 256) within the Chicago Longitudinal Research. LCA groups were modeled using multiple indicators of pre-morbid disadvantage (parental social class, educational attainment, race, gender, and work and social functioning prior to psychosis onset). The comparative longitudinal work and financial functioning of LCA groups were then examined. Results We identified three distinct latent classes: one comprised entirely of White participants, with the highest parental class and highest levels of educational attainment; a second predominantly working-class group, with equal numbers of Black and White participants; and a third with the lowest parental social class, lowest levels of education and a mix of Black and White participants. The latter, our highest social disadvantage group experienced significantly poorer employment and financial outcomes at all time-points, controlling for diagnosis, symptoms, and hospitalizations prior to baseline. Contrary to our hypotheses, on most measures, the two less disadvantaged groups did not significantly differ from each other. Conclusions Our analyses add to a growing literature on the impact of multiple forms of social disadvantage on long-term functional trajectories, underscoring the importance of proactive attention to sociostructural disadvantage early in treatment, and the development and evaluation of interventions designed to mitigate ongoing social stratification.

However, individuals differ in this stability and change. One explanation for these differences could be the influence of different genetic or environmental factors on wellbeing over time. Methods To investigate causes of stability and change of wellbeing across the lifespan, we used cohort-sequential data on wellbeing from twins and their siblings of the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR) (total N = 46.885, 56% females). We organized wellbeing data in multiple age groups, from childhood (age 5), to adolescence, up to old age (age 61+). Applying a longitudinal genetic simplex model, we investigated the phenotypic stability of wellbeing and continuity and change in genetic and environmental influences. Results Wellbeing peaked in childhood, decreased during adolescence, and stabilized during adulthood. In childhood and adolescence, around 40% of the individual differences was explained by genetic effects. The heritability decreased toward old adulthood (35-24%) and the contribution of unique environmental effects increased to 76%. Environmental innovation was found at every age, whereas genetic innovation was only observed during adolescence (10-18 years). In childhood and adulthood, the absence of genetic innovation indicates a stable underlying set of genes influencing wellbeing during these life phases. Conclusion These findings provide insights into the stability and change of wellbeing and the genetic and environmental influences across the lifespan. Genetic effects were mostly stable, except in adolescence, whereas the environmental innovation at every age suggests that changing environmental factors are a source of changes in individual differences in wellbeing over time.

There is a significant contribution of genetic factors to the etiology of bipolar disorder (BD). Unaffected first-degree relatives of patients (UR) with BD are at increased risk of developing mental disorders and may manifest cognitive impairments and alterations in brain functional and connective dynamics, akin to their affected relatives. Methods. In this prospective longitudinal study, resting-state functional connectivity was used to explore stable and progressive markers of vulnerability i.e. abnormalities shared between UR and BD compared to healthy controls (HC) and resilience i.e. features unique to UR compared to HC and BD in full or partial remission (UR n = 72, mean age = 28.0 ± 7.2 years; HC n = 64, mean age = 30.0 ± 9.7 years; BD patients n = 91, mean age = 30.6 ± 7.7 years). Out of these, 34 UR, 48 BD, and 38 HC were investigated again following a mean time of 1.3 ± 0.4 years. Results. At baseline, the UR showed lower connectivity values within the default mode network (DMN), frontoparietal network, and the salience network (SN) compared to HC. This connectivity pattern in UR remained stable over the follow-up period and was not present in BD, suggesting a resilience trait. The UR further demonstrated less negative connectivity between the DMN and SN compared to HC, abnormality that remained stable over time and was also present in BD, suggesting a vulnerability marker. Conclusion. Our findings indicate the coexistence of both vulnerability-related abnormalities in resting-state connectivity, as well as adaptive changes possibly promoting resilience to psychopathology in individual at familial risk. © The Author(s), 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Evidence is insufficient on whether digital alcohol interventions can be effective in this young comorbid population. In a randomized controlled trial, we examined the effectiveness of Beating the Booze (BtB), an add-on digital alcohol intervention to complement depression treatment for young adults. Methods Participants were randomized to BtB + depression treatment as usual (BTB + TAU, n = 81) or TAU (n = 82). The primary outcome was treatment response, a combined measure for alcohol and depression after 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes were number of weekly drinks (Timeline Follow-back) and depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale). Treatment response was analyzed using generalized linear modeling and secondary outcomes using robust linear mixed modeling. Results Low treatment response was found due to lower than expected depression remission rates. No statistically significant between-group effect was found for treatment response after 6-month follow-up (odds ratio 2.86, p = 0.089, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-9.63). For our secondary outcomes, statistically significant larger reductions in weekly drinks were found in the intervention group after 3-month (B = -4.00, p = 0.009, 95% CI -6.97 to -1.02, d = 0.27) and 6-month follow-up (B = -3.20, p = 0.032, 95% CI -6.13 to -0.27, d = 0.23). We found no statistically significant between-group differences on depressive symptoms after 3-month (B = -0.57, p = 0.732, 95% CI -3.83 to 2.69) nor after 6-month follow-up (B = -0.44, p = 0.793, 95% CI -3.69 to 2.82). Conclusions The add-on digital alcohol intervention was effective in reducing alcohol use, but not in reducing depressive symptoms and treatment response among young adults with co-occurring depressive disorders and problematic alcohol use.

Uncovering such heterogeneity using neuroimaging-based individual biomarkers, clinical behaviors, and genetic risks, might contribute to elucidating the etiology of these diseases and support precision medicine. Methods We recruited 174 drug-naïve and drug-free patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, as well as 404 healthy controls. T1 MRI imaging data, clinical symptoms, and neurocognitive assessments, and genetics were obtained and analyzed. We applied regional gray matter volumes (GMV) and quantile normative modeling to create maturation curves, and then calculated individual deviations to identify subtypes within the patients using hierarchical clustering. We compared the between-subtype differences in GMV deviations, clinical behaviors, cell-specific transcriptomic associations, and polygenic risk scores. We also validated the GMV deviations based subtyping analysis in a replication cohort. Results Two subtypes emerged: subtype 1, characterized by increased GMV deviations in the frontal cortex, cognitive impairment, a higher genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, and transcriptionally associated with Alzheimer's disease pathways, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells; and subtype 2, displaying globally decreased GMV deviations, more severe depressive symptoms, increased genetic vulnerability to major depressive disorder and transcriptionally related to microglia and inhibitory neurons. The distinct patterns of GMV deviations in the frontal, cingulate, and primary motor cortices between subtypes were shown to be replicable. Conclusions Our current results provide vital links between MRI-derived phenotypes, spatial transcriptome, genetic vulnerability, and clinical manifestation, and uncover the heterogeneity of mood disorders in biological and behavioral terms.  © The Author(s), 2024.

Cerebral microvascular dysfunction may contribute to depression via disruption of brain structures involved in mood regulation, but evidence is limited. We investigated the association of retinal microvascular function, a proxy for microvascular function in the brain, with incidence and trajectories of clinically relevant depressive symptoms. Methods. Longitudinal data are from The Maastricht Study of 5952 participants (59.9 ± 8.5 years/49.7% women) without clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline (2010–2017). Central retinal arteriolar equivalent and central retinal venular equivalent (CRAE and CRVE) and a composite score of flicker light-induced retinal arteriolar and venular dilation were assessed at baseline. We assessed incidence and trajectories of clinically relevant depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score 10). Trajectories included continuously low prevalence (low, n = 5225 [87.8%]); early increasing, then chronic high prevalence (early-chronic, n = 157 [2.6%]); low, then increasing prevalence (late-increasing, n = 247 [4.2%]); and remitting prevalence (remitting, n = 323 [5.4%]). Results. After a median follow-up of 7.0 years (range 1.0–11.0), 806 (13.5%) individuals had incident clinically relevant depressive symptoms. After full adjustment, a larger CRAE and CRVE were each associated with a lower risk of clinically relevant depressive symptoms (hazard ratios [HRs] per standard deviation [S.D.]: 0.89 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–0.96] and 0.93 [0.86–0.99], respectively), while a lower flicker light-induced retinal dilation was associated with a higher risk of clinically relevant depressive symptoms (HR per S.D.: 1.10 [1.01–1.20]). Compared to the low trajectory, a larger CRAE was associated with lower odds of belonging to the early-chronic trajectory (OR: 0.83 [0.69–0.99]) and a lower flicker light-induced retinal dilation was associated with higher odds of belonging to the remitting trajectory (OR: 1.23 [1.07–1.43]). Conclusions. These findings support the hypothesis that cerebral microvascular dysfunction contributes to the development of depressive symptoms. © The Author(s), 2024.

However, existing intervention studies using the network perspective have failed to find that symptom reductions coincide with reductions in strength of associations among these symptoms. We propose that this may reflect failure of alignment between network theory and study design and analysis. We offer hypotheses for specific symptom associations expected to be disrupted by an app-based intervention, and test sensitivity of a range of statistical metrics for identifying this intervention-induced disruption. Methods Data were analyzed from individuals with recurrent binge eating who participated in a randomized controlled trial of a cognitive-behavioral smartphone application. Participants were categorized into one of three groups: waitlist (n = 155), intervention responder (n = 49), and intervention non-responder (n = 77). Several statistical tests (bivariate associations, network-derived strength statistics, network invariance tests) were compared in ability to identify change in network structure. Results Hypothesized disruption to specific symptom associations was observed through change in bivariate correlations from baseline to post-intervention among the responder group but were not evident from symptom and whole-of-network based network analysis statistics. Effects were masked when the intervention group was assessed together, ignoring heterogeneity in treatment responsiveness. Conclusion Findings are consistent with our contention that study design and analytic approach influence the ability to test network theory predictions with fidelity.

This gap in the literature is particularly critical for pharmacotherapy for BED which is associated with relapse following discontinuation. The current study tested the efficacy of naltrexone/bupropion maintenance treatment amongst responders to acute treatments for BED. Methods Prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-site trial, conducted August 2017-December 2021, tested naltrexone/bupropion as maintenance treatment for responders to acute treatments with naltrexone/bupropion and/or behavioral weight-loss therapy for BED with comorbid obesity. Sixty-six patients (84.8% women, mean age 46.9, mean BMI 34.9 kg/m2) who responded to acute treatments were re-randomized to placebo (N = 34) or naltrexone/bupropion (N = 32) for 16 weeks; 86.3% completed posttreatment assessments. Mixed models and generalized estimating equations comparing maintenance treatments (naltrexone/bupropion v. placebo) included main and interactive effects of acute treatments. Results Intention-to-treat binge-eating remission rates following maintenance treatments were 50.0% (N = 17/34) for placebo and 68.8% (N = 22/32) for naltrexone/bupropion. Placebo following response to acute treatment with naltrexone/bupropion was associated with significantly decreased probability of binge-eating remission, increased binge-eating frequency, and no weight loss. Naltrexone/bupropion following response to acute treatment with naltrexone/bupropion was associated with good maintenance of binge-eating remission, low binge-eating frequency, and significant additional weight loss. Conclusions Adult patients with BED with co-occurring obesity who have good responses to acute treatment with naltrexone/bupropion should be offered maintenance treatment with naltrexone/bupropion.

This study employs person-centered analysis to probe the relationship between stress responses, psychopathology, and neural patterns in female adolescents who are oversampled for engagement in NSSI. Methods Adolescent females (N = 109, ages 12-17) underwent a social stress test from which self-report measures of stress experience, observer ratings of stress expression, and physiological metrics of stress (via salivary cortisol) were obtained. Multi-trajectory modeling was employed to identify concordant and discordant stress EEP groups. Depressive symptoms, SI and attempt, NSSI engagement, frontal and limbic activation to emotional stimuli, and resting state fronto-limbic connectivity were examined in the EEP groups derived from the multi-trajectory models. Results Four groups were identified, three of which demonstrated relatively concordant EEP and one which demonstrated discordant EEP (High Experience-High Expression-Low Physiology). Further, replicating past research, the High Experience-High Expression-Low Physiology discordant group exhibited higher depressive symptoms, SI, suicide attempt, and NSSI episodes (only for sensitivity analyses based on past year) relative to other EEP groups. No significant group differences in brain functioning emerged. Conclusion Results indicate that within-person, multi-level patterns in stress responding capture risk for dysfunction including depression and self-injurious thoughts and behaviors. Further interrogating of system-level stress functioning may better inform assessment and intervention efforts.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

The cause for such hippocampal inflammation is still unknown, but it has been suggested that herpes virus infection is involved. This study therefore aimed to determine whether add-on treatment of schizophrenic patients with the anti- viral drug valaciclovir would reduce hippocampal neuroinflammation and consequently improve cognitive symptoms. Methods We performed a double-blind monocenter study in 24 male and female patients with schizophrenia, experiencing active psychotic symptoms. Patients were orally treated with the anti-viral drug valaciclovir for seven consecutive days (8 g/day). Neuroinflammation was measured with Positron Emission Tomography using the translocator protein ligand [11C]-PK11195, pre-treatment and at seven days post-treatment, as were psychotic symptoms and cognition. Results Valaciclovir treatment resulted in reduced TSPO binding (39%) in the hippocampus, as well as in the brainstem, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, insula and cingulate gyri, nucleus accumbens and thalamus (31-40%) when using binding potential (BPND) as an outcome. With total distribution volume (VT) as outcome we found essentially the same results, but associations only approached statistical significance (p = 0.050 for hippocampus). Placebo treatment did not affect neuroinflammation. No effects of valaciclovir on psychotic symptoms or cognitive functioning were found. Conclusion We found a decreased TSPO binding following antiviral treatment, which could suggest a viral underpinning of neuroinflammation in psychotic patients. Whether this reduced neuroinflammation by treatment with valaciclovir has clinical implications and is specific for schizophrenia warrants further research.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods SR, MD, AUD, and DUD registrations were assessed from national Swedish registries. From the population followed from 2000 to 2018, those exposed to death of a close relative in 2002-2016 were matched to unexposed controls and analyzed in males and females by a controlled pre-post design using a difference-in-difference method. Results Substantial, brief increases in risk for SR and more modest prolonged increases in MD were observed after death of relatives in both men and women greatest with children, followed by spouses, parents, and siblings. Relatively long-lasting modest increases in AUD but not DUD were also observed following death of relatives. The absolute increases for SR and MD were greater in females than males and for AUD greater in males than females. However, logistic regression analyses showed most effects did not differ significantly by sex. Consistently larger increases in disorder risk were seen with the death of younger v. older parents, siblings, and spouses and with accidental v. non-accidental death in children. Conclusions Applying a matched cohort design to Swedish population registries, death of close relatives was associated with, and likely caused, substantial increases in rates of SR, MD, and AUD, consistent with smaller prior clinical investigations. Through such registries, we can, in large representative samples, integrate the impact of exposures to selected environmental adversities into disorder risk pathways.  © The Author(s), 2023.

This study aimed to examine whether the dysregulation of complement components contributes to brain structural defects in patients with mood disorders. Methods A total of 52 BD patients, 35 MDD patients, and 53 controls were recruited. The human complement immunology assay was used to measure the levels of complement factors. Whole brain-based analysis was performed to investigate differences in gray matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness (CT) among the BD, MDD, and control groups, and relationships were explored between neuroanatomical differences and levels of complement components. Results GMV in the medial orbital frontal cortex (mOFC) and middle cingulum was lower in both patient groups than in controls, while the CT of the left precentral gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus were affected differently in the two disorders. Concentrations of C1q, C4, factor B, factor H, and properdin were higher in both patient groups than in controls, while concentrations of C3, C4 and factor H were significantly higher in BD than in MDD. Concentrations of C1q, factor H, and properdin showed a significant negative correlation with GMV in the mOFC at the voxel-wise level. Conclusions BD and MDD are associated with shared and different alterations in levels of complement factors and structural impairment in the brain. Structural defects in mOFC may be associated with elevated levels of certain complement factors, providing insight into the shared neuro-inflammatory pathogenesis of mood disorders.

We aimed to investigate the association of MDD with the local gyrification index (LGI) in each cortical region at the whole-brain level, and the association of the LGI with clinical characteristics of MDD. Methods We obtained T1-weighted images from 234 patients with MDD and 215 healthy controls (HCs). The LGI values from 66 cortical regions in the bilateral hemispheres were automatically calculated according to the Desikan-Killiany atlas. We compared the LGI values between the MDD and HC groups using analysis of covariance, including age, sex, and years of education as covariates. The association between the clinical characteristics and LGI values was investigated in the MDD group. Results Compared with HCs, patients with MDD showed significantly decreased LGI values in the cortical regions, including the bilateral ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices, insula, right rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and several temporal and parietal regions, with the largest effect size in the left pars triangularis (Cohen's f2 = 0.361; p = 1.78 × 10-13). Regarding the association of clinical characteristics with LGIs within the MDD group, recurrence and longer illness duration were associated with increased gyrification in several occipital and temporal regions, which showed no significant difference in LGIs between the MDD and HC groups. Conclusions These findings suggest that the LGI may be a relatively stable neuroimaging marker associated with MDD predisposition. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Evidence from short-term follow-up (6-week post-treatment) studies suggests that these deficits may improve or be reversed with treatment, although longer-term outcomes are unknown. Here we examined the one-year trajectory of functional activation in brain circuitry associated with reward anticipation in people with recent onset SZ who participated in coordinated specialty care (CSC) treatment, hypothesizing normalization of brain response mirroring previous short-term findings in first-episode individuals. Method Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and ventral striatum (VS) associated with reward anticipation during the Incentivized Control Engagement Task (ICE-T) was analyzed in a baseline sample of 49 healthy controls (HCs) and 52 demographically matched people with SZ, with follow-up data available for 35 HCs and 17 people with SZ. Results In agreement with our hypothesis, significant time × diagnosis interactions were observed across all regions, in which reward anticipation-associated BOLD response increased in SZ to above baseline HC levels at follow-up. Increased VS activation was associated with decreased reality distortion symptoms over the follow-up period. Baseline reward anticipation-associated BOLD response in the right anterior insula was associated with improvement in reality distortion symptoms. Conclusions These findings suggest that functional deficits in reward anticipation may be reversed after one year of CSC in recent onset participants with SZ, and that this improvement is associated with reduced positive symptoms in the illness.

Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving antipsychotics for people with autism of all ages, irrespective of the outcomes assessed. We searched seven databases and hand-searched ten relevant journals. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full papers and extracted data using the Cochrane Handbook template. We conducted meta-analyses of outcomes and the rate of adverse events. Results We included 39 papers based on 21 primary RCTs that recruited 1482 people with autism. No RCT assessed any psychiatric disorder outcome, such as psychoses or bipolar disorder. A meta-analysis of ten placebo-controlled RCTs showed a significantly improved Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Irritability score in the antipsychotic group with an effect size of -6.45 [95% confidence interval (CI) -8.13 to -4.77] (low certainty).

To overcome these barriers, we tested the use of an exteroceptive augmentation to BFM, using vibrations equivalent to the amplitude of the auditory waveform of the actual breath, delivered via a wearable subwoofer in real time (VBFM). We tested whether this device enhanced interoceptive processes, attentional control and autonomic regulation in trauma-exposed women with dissociative symptoms. Methods 65 women, majority (82%) Black American, aged 18-65 completed self-report measures of interoception and 6 BFM sessions, during which electrocardiographic recordings were taken to derive high-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) estimates. A subset (n = 31) of participants completed functional MRI at pre- and post-intervention, during which they were administered an affective attentional control task. Results Compared to those who received BFM only, women who received VBFM demonstrated greater increases in interoception, particularly their ability to trust body signals, increased sustained attention, as well as increased connectivity between nodes of emotion processing and interoceptive networks. Intervention condition moderated the relationship between interoception change and dissociation change, as well as the relationship between dissociation and HRV change. Conclusions Vibration feedback during breath focus yielded greater improvements in interoception, sustained attention and increased connectivity of emotion processing and interoceptive networks. Augmenting BFM with vibration appears to have considerable effects on interoception, attention and autonomic regulation; it could be used as a monotherapy or to address trauma treatment barriers.

Significant connections were examined as potential mediators of the relationship between pubertal timing and mental health (withdrawn depressed and rule-breaking) problems. Exploratory analyses interrogated whether the family environment moderated neural risk patterns in those undergoing puberty earlier than their peers. Results Earlier pubertal timing was related to decreased connectivity between limbic structures (bilateral amygdala and right hippocampus) and the cingulo-opercular network, left amygdala and somatomotor (mouth) network, as well as between the left hippocampus and ventral attention network and visual network. Corticolimbic connections also mediated the relationship between earlier pubertal timing and increased withdrawn depressed problems (but not rule-breaking problems). Finally, parental acceptance buffered against connectivity patterns that were implicated in withdrawn depressed problems in those undergoing puberty earlier than their peers. Conclusion Findings highlight the role of decreased corticolimbic connectivity in mediating pathways between earlier pubertal timing and withdrawn depressed problems, and we present preliminary evidence that the family environment may buffer against these neural risk patterns during early adolescence.

We examined how risks of hospitalisation for a wide range of vaccine-preventable conditions varied by age and sex among mental health (MH) service users. Methods Linked population data from New South Wales (NSW), Australia were used to identify vaccine-preventable hospitalisations (VPH) for 19 conditions from 2015 to 2020. Adult MH service users (n = 418 915) were compared to other NSW residents using incidence rates standardised for age, sex and socioeconomic status. Secondary analyses examined admissions for COVID-19 to September 2021. Results We identified 94 180 VPH of which 41% were influenza, 33% hepatitis B and 10% herpes zoster. MH service users had more VPH admissions [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 3.2, 95% CI 3.1-3.3]. Relative risks were highest for hepatitis (aIRR 4.4, 95% CI 4.3-4.6), but elevated for all conditions including COVID-19 (aIRR 2.0, 95% CI 1.9-2.2). MH service users had a mean age of 9 years younger than other NSW residents at first VPH admission, with the largest age gap for vaccine-preventable pneumonias (11-13 years younger). The highest relative risk of VPH was among MH service users aged 45-65. Conclusions MH service users have increased risk of hospitalisation for many vaccine-preventable conditions. This may be due to reduced vaccination rates, more severe illness requiring hospitalisation, greater exposure to infectious conditions or other factors. People living with mental illness should be prioritised in vaccination strategies.  © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Confidence abnormalities have been found in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A first notion based on clinical case-control studies suggests lower confidence in OCD patients compared to healthy controls. Contrarily, studies in highly compulsive individuals from general population samples showed that obsessive-compulsive symptoms related positively or not at all to confidence. A second notion suggests that an impairment in confidence estimation and usage is related to compulsive behavior, which is more often supported by studies in general population samples. These opposite findings call into question whether findings from highly compulsive individuals from the general population are generalizable to OCD patient populations. Methods To test this, we investigated confidence at three hierarchical levels: local confidence in single decisions, global confidence in task performance and higher-order self-beliefs in 40 OCD patients (medication-free, no comorbid diagnoses), 40 controls, and 40 matched highly compulsive individuals from the general population (HComp). Results In line with the first notion we found that OCD patients exhibited relative underconfidence at all three hierarchical levels. In contrast, HComp individuals showed local and global overconfidence and worsened metacognitive sensitivity compared with OCD patients, in line with the second notion. Conclusions Metacognitive functioning observed in a general highly compulsive population, often used as an analog for OCD, is distinct from that in a clinical OCD population, suggesting that OC symptoms in these two groups relate differently to (meta)cognitive processes. These findings call for caution in generalizing (meta)cognitive findings from general population to clinical samples.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

However, it remains unclear how miR-146a-5p dysregulation produces in vivo brain structural abnormalities in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods In this case-control study, we combined cortical morphology analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and miR-146a-5p quantification to investigate the neuropathological effect of miR-146a-5p on cortical thickness in MDD patients. Serum-derived exosomes that were considered to readily cross the blood-brain barrier and contain miR-146a-5p were isolated for miRNA quantification. Moreover, follow-up MRI scans were performed in the MDD patients after 6 weeks of antidepressant treatment to further validate the clinical relevance of the relationship between miR-146a-5p and brain structural abnormalities. Results In total, 113 medication-free MDD patients and 107 matched healthy controls were included. Vertex-vise general linear model revealed miR-146a-5p-dependent cortical thinning in MDD patients compared with healthy individuals, i.e., overexpression of miR-146a-5p was associated with reduced cortical thickness in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral lateral occipital cortices (LOCs), etc. Moreover, this relationship between baseline miR-146a-5p and cortical thinning was nonsignificant for all regions in the patients who had received antidepressant treatment, and higher baseline miR-146a-5p expression was found to be related to greater longitudinal cortical thickening in the left OFC and right LOC. Conclusions The findings of this study reveal a relationship between miR-146a-5p overexpression and cortical atrophy and thus may help specify the in vivo mediating effect of miR-146a-5p dysregulation on brain structural abnormalities in patients with MDD.

This study investigates patterns of cannabis use and associations with psychoses in three Global South (regions within Latin America, Asia, Africa and Oceania) settings. Methods Case-control study within the International Programme of Research on Psychotic Disorders (INTREPID) II conducted between May 2018 and September 2020. In each setting, we recruited over 200 individuals with an untreated psychosis and individually-matched controls (Kancheepuram India; Ibadan, Nigeria; northern Trinidad). Controls, with no past or current psychotic disorder, were individually-matched to cases by 5-year age group, sex and neighbourhood. Presence of psychotic disorder assessed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and cannabis exposure measured by the World Health Organisation Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). Results Cases reported higher lifetime and frequent cannabis use than controls in each setting. In Trinidad, cannabis use was associated with increased odds of psychotic disorder: lifetime cannabis use (adj. OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.99-2.53); frequent cannabis use (adj. OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.10-3.60); cannabis dependency (as measured by high ASSIST score) (adj. OR 4.70, 95% CI 1.77-12.47), early age of first use (adj. OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.03-3.27). Cannabis use in the other two settings was too rare to examine associations. Conclusions In line with previous studies, we found associations between cannabis use and the occurrence and age of onset of psychoses in Trinidad. These findings have implications for strategies for prevention of psychosis. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Methods This study examined whether a suicidality polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from a large genome-wide association study (N = 122,935) was associated with suicide attempts in a population-based sample of European-American US military veterans (N = 1664; 92.5% male), and whether cumulative lifetime trauma exposure moderated this association. Results Eighty-five veterans (weighted 6.3%) reported a history of suicide attempt. After adjusting for sociodemographic and psychiatric characteristics, suicidality PRS was associated with lifetime suicide attempt (odds ratio 2.65; 95% CI 1.37-5.11). A significant suicidality PRS-by-trauma exposure interaction emerged, such that veterans with higher levels of suicidality PRS and greater trauma burden had the highest probability of lifetime suicide attempt (16.6%), whereas the probability of attempts was substantially lower among those with high suicidality PRS and low trauma exposure (1.4%). The PRS-by-trauma interaction effect was enriched for genes implicated in cellular and developmental processes, and nervous system development, with variants annotated to the DAB2 and SPNS2 genes, which are implicated in inflammatory processes. Drug repurposing analyses revealed upregulation of suicide gene-sets in the context of medrysone, a drug targeting chronic inflammation, and clofibrate, a triacylglyceride level lowering agent. Conclusion Results suggest that genetic liability to suicidality is associated with increased risk of suicide attempt among veterans, particularly in the presence of high levels of cumulative trauma exposure. Additional research is warranted to investigate whether incorporation of genomic information may improve suicide prediction models. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods We systematically integrated three independent brain expression quantitative traits (eQTLs) (CommonMind, GTEx, and BrainSeq Phase 2, a total of 1039 individuals) and GWAS data (56 418 cases and 78 818 controls), with the use of transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging was utilized to quantify the integrity of white matter bundles and determine whether polygenic risk of novel genes linked to brain structure was present in patients with first-episode antipsychotic SCZ. Results TWAS showed that eight risk genes (CORO7, DDAH2, DDHD2, ELAC2, GLT8D1, PCDHA8, THOC7, and TYW5) reached transcriptome-wide significance (TWS) level. These findings were confirmed by an independent integrative approach (i.e. Sherlock). We further conducted conditional analyses and identified the potential risk genes that driven the TWAS association signal in each locus. Gene expression analysis showed that several TWS genes (including CORO7, DDAH2, DDHD2, ELAC2, GLT8D1, THOC7 and TYW5) were dysregulated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of SCZ cases compared with controls. TWS genes were mainly expressed on the surface of glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, and microglia. Finally, SCZ cases had a substantially greater TWS genes-based polygenic risk (PRS) compared to controls, and we showed that fractional anisotropy of the cingulum-hippocampus mediates the influence of TWS genes PRS on SCZ. Conclusions Our findings identified novel SCZ risk genes and highlighted the importance of the TWS genes in frontal-limbic dysfunctions in SCZ, indicating possible therapeutic targets.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

However, the differential impacts of diagnostic type and degree of parental burden (e.g. one v. both parents affected) on these functional outcomes are unknown. Methods Using the Swedish national patient (NPR) and multi-generation (MGR) registers, 2 226 451 children (1 290 157 parental pairs), born 1 January 1973-31 December 1997, were followed through 31 December 2013. Diagnostic status of all cohort members was defined for eleven psychiatric disorders, and families classed by exposure: (1) parents affected with any disorder, (2) parents affected with a disorder group (e.g. neuropsychiatric disorders), and (3) parents affected with a specific disorder (e.g. ADHD). Pairs were further defined as 'unaffected,' 'single-affected,', or 'dual-affected.' Among offspring, the study evaluated fulfillment of four academic milestones, from compulsory (primary) school through University (college). Sensitivity analyses considered the impact of child's own mental health, as well as parental education, on main effects. Results Marked reductions in the odds of achievement were observed, emerging at the earliest levels of schooling for both single-affected [adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 0.50; 95% CI 0.49-0.51] and dual-affected (aOR 0.29, 95% CI 0.28-0.30) pairs and persisting thereafter [aOR range (single), 0.52-0.65; aOR range (dual), 0.30-0.40]. This pattern was repeated for analyses within diagnosis/diagnostic group. Main results were robust to adjustment for offspring mental health and parent education level. Conclusions Parental mental illness is associated with profound reductions in educational attainment in the subsequent generation, with children from dual-affected families at uniquely high risk.

The type and impact of trauma may differ between sexes. In a large sample of recent-onset patients, we investigated the associations of depressive and negative symptoms with childhood trauma and whether these are sex-specific. Methods A total of 187 first-episode psychosis patients in remission (Handling Antipsychotic Medication: Long-term Evaluation of Targeted Treatment study) and 115 recent-onset SSD patients (Simvastatin study) were included in this cross-sectional study (men: n = 218; women: n = 84). Total trauma score and trauma subtypes were assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire Short Form; depressive and negative symptoms were rated using the Positive And Negative Symptoms Scale. Sex-specific regression analyses were performed. Results Women reported higher rates of sexual abuse than men (23.5% v. 7.8%). Depressive symptoms were associated with total trauma scores and emotional abuse ratings in men (β: 0.219-0.295; p ≤ 0.001). In women, depressive symptoms were associated with sexual abuse ratings (β: 0.271; p = 0.011). Negative symptoms were associated with total trauma score and emotional neglect ratings in men (β: 0.166-0.232; p ≤ 0.001). Negative symptoms in women were not linked to childhood trauma, potentially due to lack of statistical power. Conclusions Depressive symptom severity was associated with different types of trauma in men and women with recent-onset SSD.

A prospective population-based cohort study was implemented to examine the association between maternal RA and offspring ASD. Methods We included all children born alive in Sweden from 1995 to 2015, followed up through 2017. Diagnoses of ASD and RA were clinically ascertained from National Patient Register. We quantified the association by hazard ratios (HR) and two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI), from Cox regression after detailed adjustment for potential confounders. We examined RA serostatus, etiological subgroups and the timing of exposure. To closer examine the underlying mechanism for the association, we included a negative control group for RA, arthralgia, with similar symptomology as RA but free from inflammation/autoimmunity. Results Of 3629 children born to mothers with RA, 70 (1.94%) were diagnosed with ASD, compared to 28 892 (1.92%) of 1 503 908 children born to mothers without RA. Maternal RA before delivery was associated with an increased risk of offspring ASD (HR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.11-1.84), especially for seronegative RA (HR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.12-2.30). No similar association was observed for paternal RA, maternal sisters with RA, or RA diagnosed after delivery. Maternal arthralgia displayed as high risks for offspring ASD as did maternal RA (HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.24-1.60). Conclusions In Sweden, maternal RA before delivery was associated with an increased risk of offspring ASD. The comparable association between maternal arthralgia and ASD risk suggests other pathways of risk than autoimmunity/inflammation, acting jointly or independently of RA.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods This study evaluates the cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of tCBT + TAU over an 8-month time horizon. For the reference case, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) obtained using the EQ-5D-5L, and the health system perspective were chosen. Alternatively, anxiety-free days (AFDs), derived from the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the limited societal perspective were considered. Unadjusted incremental cost-effectiveness/utility ratios were calculated. Net-benefit regressions were done for a willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds range to build cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC). Sensitivity analyses were included. Results Compared to TAU (n = 114), tCBT + TAU (n = 117) generated additional QALYs, AFDs, and higher mental health care costs from the health system perspective. From the health system and the limited societal perspectives, at a WTP of Can 50 000/QALY, the CEACs showed that the probability of tCBT + TAU v. TAU being cost-effective was 97 and 89%. Promising cost-effectiveness results using AFDs are also presented. The participation of therapists from the public health sector could increase cost-effectiveness. Conclusions From the limited societal and health system perspectives, this first economic evaluation of tCBT shows favourable cost-effectiveness results at a WTP threshold of Can 50 000/QALY. Future research is needed to replicate findings in longer follow-up studies and different health system contexts to better inform decision-makers for a full-scale implementation.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

We compare the level and growth of anxious-depressed, behavioral and attention problems in an autistic and typically developing (TD) cohort. Methods Latent growth curve models were applied to repeated parent-report Child Behavior Checklist data from age 2-10 years in an inception cohort of autistic children (Pathways, N = 397; 84% boys) and a general population TD cohort (Wirral Child Health and Development Study; WCHADS; N = 884, 49% boys). Percentile plots were generated to quantify the differences between autistic and TD children. Results Autistic children showed elevated levels of mental health problems, but this was substantially reduced by accounting for IQ and sex differences between the autistic and TD samples. There was small differences in growth patterns; anxious-depressed problems were particularly elevated at preschool and attention problems at late childhood. Higher family income predicted lower base-level on all three dimensions, but steeper increase of anxious-depressed problems. Higher IQ predicted lower level of attention problems and faster decline over childhood. Female sex predicted higher level of anxious-depressed and faster decline in behavioral problems. Social-affect autism symptom severity predicted elevated level of attention problems. Autistic girls' problems were particularly elevated relative to their same-sex non-autistic peers. Conclusions Autistic children, and especially girls, show elevated mental health problems compared to TD children and there are some differences in predictors. Assessment of mental health should be integrated into clinical practice for autistic children.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Methods In over 9000 twins from the population-based Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders, the occurrence of all nine DSM symptomatic criteria for MD in the last year was assessed at personal interview and then grouped by their temporal co-occurrence. The DSM criteria which occurred outside (OUT) v. inside of (IN) MD episodes were then separated. We calculated tetrachoric correlations for OUT and IN depressive criteria in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) pairs and fitted univariate and bivariate ACE twin models using OpenMx. Results The mean twin correlations (±95% CIs) for IN depressive criteria were substantially higher than for OUT depressive criteria in both MZ [+0.35 (0.32-0.38) v. 0.20 (0.17-0.24)] and DZ pairs [0.20 (0.17-0.24) v. 0.10 (0.04-0.16]. The mean IN-OUT cross-correlation in MZ and DZ pairs was modest [+0.15 (0.07-0.24) and +0.07 (0.03-0.12)]. The mean heritability estimates for the nine In v. Out depressive criteria was 0.31 (0.22-0.41) and 0.15 (0.08-0.21), in MZ and DZ pairs, respectively. The mean genetic correlation between the nine IN and OUT depressive criteria was +0.07 (-0.07 to 0.21). Conclusions Depressive criteria occurring outside depressive episodes are less heritable than those occurring within. These two ways criteria can manifest are not closely genetically related. Current depressive symptoms - most of which are occurring outside of depressive episodes - are not, for genetic studies, good proxies for MD.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Meanwhile, though the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is established as a crucial brain region involved in attentional control, the causal relationship between the DLPFC and voluntary distraction is unexplored in patients. Methods Combing explicit distraction and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), this study investigated whether TMS-activated DLPFC facilitates voluntary distraction in MDD patients. Eighty patients diagnosed with current MDD underwent either active (n = 40) or sham (n = 40) TMS sessions, followed by receiving negative social feedback from other patients, during which they were requied to use distraction strategy to down-regulate their painful feelings. Electroencephalogram was recorded during the task. Results Both the subjective emotional rating and the amplitude of late positive potential showed that depressed patients successfully down-regulate their negative emotions via voluntary distraction, and the TMS-activated left DLPFC produced a larger benefit of emotion regulation compared to the sham TMS group. Results also revealed that while emotion regulation effect was negatively associated with depressive symptoms in the sham TMS group, this correlation was largely diminished when patients' left DLPFC was activated by TMS during the voluntary distraction. Conclusions These findings demonstrated that distraction is valuable for emotion regulation in MDD patients and they could be beneficial in voluntary distraction by activating their left DLPFC using neural modulation techniques. This study has valuable implications for clinical treatement of emotional dysregulation in MDD patients.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

However, whether epigenetic aging measured at the time of trauma predicts the subsequent development of PTSD outcomes is unknown. Moreover, the neural substrates underlying posttraumatic outcomes associated with epigenetic aging are unclear. Methods We examined a multi-ancestry cohort of women and men (n = 289) who presented to the emergency department (ED) after trauma. Blood DNA was collected at ED presentation, and EPIC DNA methylation arrays were used to assess four widely used metrics of epigenetic aging (HorvathAge, HannumAge, PhenoAge, and GrimAge). PTSD symptoms were evaluated longitudinally at the time of ED presentation and over the ensuing 6 months. Structural and functional neuroimaging was performed 2 weeks after trauma. Results After covariate adjustment and correction for multiple comparisons, advanced ED GrimAge predicted increased risk for 6-month probable PTSD diagnosis. Secondary analyses suggested that the prediction of PTSD by GrimAge was driven by worse trajectories for intrusive memories and nightmares. Advanced ED GrimAge was also associated with reduced volume of the whole amygdala and specific amygdala subregions, including the cortico-amygdaloid transition and the cortical and accessory basal nuclei. Conclusions Our findings shed new light on the relation between biological aging and trauma-related phenotypes, suggesting that GrimAge measured at the time of trauma predicts PTSD trajectories and is associated with relevant brain alterations. Furthering these findings has the potential to enhance early prevention and treatment of posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Social isolation, which has similar detrimental effects on health, may be associated with accelerated brain aging though little is known about how different trajectories of social isolation across the life course moderate this association. We examined the associations between social isolation trajectories from age 5 to age 38 and brain age assessed at age 45. Methods We previously created a typology of social isolation based on onset during the life course and persistence into adulthood, using group-based trajectory analysis of longitudinal data from a New Zealand birth cohort. The typology comprises four groups: 'never-isolated', 'adult-only', 'child-only', and persistent 'child-adult' isolation. A brain age gap estimate (brainAGE) - the difference between predicted age from structural MRI date and chronological age - was derived at age 45. We undertook analyses of brainAGE with trajectory group as the predictor, adjusting for sex, family socio-economic status, and a range of familial and child-behavioral factors. Results Older brain age in mid-adulthood was associated with trajectories of social isolation after adjustment for family and child confounders, particularly for the 'adult-only' group compared to the 'never-isolated' group. Conclusions Although our findings are associational, they indicate that preventing social isolation, particularly in mid-adulthood, may help to avert accelerated brain aging associated with negative health outcomes later in life.

Previous studies have reported an association between tobacco use and schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between tobacco use and first-episode psychosis (FEP), age at onset of psychosis, and specific diagnosis of psychosis. Methods The sample consisted of 1105 FEP patients and 1355 controls from the European Network of National Schizophrenia Networks Studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) study. We assessed substance use with the Tobacco and Alcohol Questionnaire and performed a series of regression analyses using case-control status, age of onset of psychosis, and diagnosis as outcomes and tobacco use and frequency of tobacco use as predictors. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol, and cannabis use. Results After controlling for cannabis use, FEP patients were 2.6 times more likely to use tobacco [p ≤ 0.001; adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.1-3.2]] and 1.7 times more likely to smoke 20 or more cigarettes a day (p = 0.003; AOR 1.7; 95% CI [1.2-2.4]) than controls. Tobacco use was associated with an earlier age at psychosis onset (β = -2.3; p ≤ 0.001; 95% CI [-3.7 to -0.9]) and was 1.3 times more frequent in FEP patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia than in other diagnoses of psychosis (AOR 1.3; 95% CI [1.0-1.8]); however, these results were no longer significant after controlling for cannabis use. Conclusions Tobacco and heavy-tobacco use are associated with increased odds of FEP. These findings further support the relevance of tobacco prevention in young populations.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods Data were combined from three prevention trials that targeted young women at high-risk for eating disorders (N = 1092; M age = 19.3). Participants were randomized to Body Project groups led by peer educators or expressive writing/educational controls and completed masked diagnostic interviews over 2- to 4-year follow-ups. Logistic regressions tested whether onset of each eating disorder over follow-up differed between Body Project and control participants. Results Peer-led Body Project groups produced a 46% reduction in onset of subthreshold/threshold BN and a 62% reduction in onset of PD relative to controls over follow-up. Rates of onset of subthreshold/threshold AN and BED did not significantly differ between peer-led Body Project participants and control participants. Conclusions Results support the dissemination of the peer-led Body Project for reducing future onset of BN and PD. This study and recent research suggest that thin-ideal internalization, the risk factor for eating disorders targeted in the Body Project, may be more relevant for predicting onset of BN and PD compared to AN and BED. Findings support the development of a version of the Body Project aimed to reduce risk factors that have predicted future onset of all four types of eating disorders (e.g. overvaluation of weight/shape, fear of weight gain), which may more effectively prevent all eating disorder types.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Conflicting data suggest that the observed risk depends on setting of recruitment. We assessed the relative risk of non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD) in a large, representative cohort of transgender persons. Methods This cohort was composed using: data on legal sex change from the Dutch population registry and data on dispensing of cross-sex hormones (route 1), and a registry of insurance claims from mental health care including persons with a diagnosis of gender identity disorder (DSM-IV) or gender dysphoria (DSM-5) (route 2). They were matched by sex at birth, calendar year and country of birth to controls from the general population. Transgender persons (N = 5564) and controls (N = 27 820), aged 16-60 years at 1 January 2011, were followed until the first insurance claim for NAPD in 2011-2019. Results The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of NAPD for transgender persons selected exclusively through route 1 (N = 3859, IRR = 2.00, 95%-CI 1.52-2.63) was increased, but significantly lower than the IRRs for those selected exclusively through route 2 (N = 694, IRR = 22.15, 95%-CI 13.91-35.28) and for those found by both routes (N = 1011, IRR = 5.17, 95%-CI 3.57-7.49; p value for differences in IRR < 0.001). Conclusions This study supports the social defeat-hypothesis of NAPD. The results also show the presence of a substantial number of transgender persons with severe psychiatric problems who have not (yet) taken steps to gender-affirmative care.

The purpose of the present study is to clarify the strength and direction of associations between adolescent internet use and the development of depression symptoms using a longitudinal modeling approach. We also examine whether associations differ for boys and girls. Methods Data are drawn from (N = 1547) participants followed for the Quebec longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD 1998-2020). Youth self-reported internet use in terms of the average hours of use per week at the ages of 13, 15, and 17. Youth also self-reported depression symptoms at the same ages. Results After testing sex-invariance, random intercepts cross-lagged panel models stratified by sex, revealed that internet use by girls was associated with significant within-person (time-varying) change in depression symptoms. Girl's internet use at age 13 was associated with increased depression symptoms at age 15 (β = 0.12) and internet use at age 15 increased depression at age 17 (β = 0.10). For boys, internet use was not associated with significant time varying change in depression symptoms. Conclusions The present findings support the hypothesis that internet use by adolescents can represent a significant risk factor for the development of depressive symptoms, particularly in girls.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

What explains this range of PLE prevalence? Despite extensive research, the clinical significance of PLEs remains unclear. Are PLE prevalence and clinical severity differentially associated across ethnoracial groups? Methods We examined the lifetime prevalence and clinical significance of PLEs across ethnoracial groups in the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (N = 11 139) using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) psychosis symptom screener. Outcomes included mental healthcare use (inpatient, outpatient), mental health morbidity (self-perceived poor/fair mental health, suicidal ideation or attempts), and impairment (role interference). Individuals with outcome onsets prior to PLE onset were excluded. We also examined associations of PLEs with CIDI diagnoses. Cox proportional-hazards regression and logistic regression modeling identified associations of interest. Results Contrary to previous reports, only Asian Americans differed significantly from other U.S. ethnoracial groups, reporting lower lifetime prevalence (6.7% v. 8.0-11.9%) and mean number (0.09 v. 0.11-0.18) of PLEs. In multivariate analyses, PLE clinical significance showed limited ethnoracial variation among Asian Americans, non-Caribbean Latinos, and Afro-Caribbeans. In other groups, mental health outcomes showed significant ethnoracial clustering by outcome (e.g. hospitalization and role interference with Caribbean-Latino origin), possibly due to underlying differences in psychiatric disorder chronicity or treatment barriers. Conclusions While there is limited ethnoracial variation in U.S. PLE prevalence, PLE clinical significance varies across U.S. ethnoracial groups. Clinicians should consider this variation when assessing PLEs to avoid exaggerating their clinical significance, contributing to mental healthcare disparities.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Reward processing encompasses a series of psychological components. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the brain dysfunction related to reward processing of individuals with SCZ spectrum disorders and risks, covering multiple reward components. Methods After a systematic literature search, 37 neuroimaging studies were identified and divided into four groups based on their target psychology components (i.e. reward anticipation, reward consumption, reward learning, effort computation). Whole-brain Seed-based d Mapping (SDM) meta-analyses were conducted for all included studies and each component. Results The meta-analysis for all reward-related studies revealed reduced functional activation across the SCZ spectrum in the striatum, orbital frontal cortex, cingulate cortex, and cerebellar areas. Meanwhile, distinct abnormal patterns were found for reward anticipation (decreased activation of the cingulate cortex and striatum), reward consumption (decreased activation of cerebellum IV/V areas, insula and inferior frontal gyri), and reward learning processing (decreased activation of the striatum, thalamus, cerebellar Crus I, cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and parietal and occipital areas). Lastly, our qualitative review suggested that decreased activation of the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex was also involved in effort computation. Conclusions These results provide deep insights on the component-based neuro-psychopathological mechanisms for anhedonia and amotivation symptoms of the SCZ spectrum.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Childhood maltreatment might contribute to this medical morbidity, which remains underexplored in the literature. Methods We assessed 2891 outpatients with BD (according to DSM-IV criteria). Childhood maltreatment was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Lifetime diagnoses for medical disorders were retrospectively assessed using a systematic interview and checked against medical notes. Medical morbidity was defined by the sum of medical disorders. We investigated associations between childhood maltreatment (neglect and abuse) and medical morbidity while adjusting for potential confounders. Results One quarter of individuals had no medical comorbidities, while almost half of them had at least two. Multivariable regression showed that childhood maltreatment (mainly abuse, but also sexual abuse) was associated with a higher medical morbidity. Medical morbidity was also associated with sex, age, body mass index, sleep disturbances, lifetime anxiety disorders and lifetime density of mood episodes. Childhood maltreatment was associated with an increased prevalence of four (i.e. migraine/headache, drug eruption, duodenal ulcer, and thyroid diseases) of the fifteen most frequent medical disorders, however with no difference in terms of age at onset. Conclusions This large cross-sectional study confirmed a high medical morbidity in BD and its association with childhood maltreatment. The assessment of childhood maltreatment in individuals with BD should be systematically included in routine care and the potential impact on physical health of psycho-social interventions targeting childhood maltreatment and its consequences should be evaluated.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Here we investigated the shared familiality of IC and these other nociplastic and psychiatric conditions. Methods Subjects were identified in the Utah Population Database, which links genealogy data back to the 1800s to medical record diagnosis billing code data back to 1995. We computed the relative risk of each of these disorders among first (FDR), second (SDR), and third-degree relatives (TDR) of six proband groups: IC, FM, IBS, ME/CFS, PD, and MDD. Given the known familial aggregation of each of these disorders, we conducted our analyses to test for heritable interrelationships using proband subgroups whose members did not have the diagnosis assessed in their relatives. Results We observed strong evidence for heritable interrelationships among all six disorders. Most analyses indicated significantly increased risk for each of the six disorders in FDR, SDR, and TDR of all or most proband groups. Out of 30 possible bidirectional disorder interrelationships, 26 were significant among FDR, 23 were significant among SDR, and 7 were significant among TDR. Clustering was observed in both close and distant relatives. Conclusions Our results support a common, heritable component to IC and other nociplastic and psychiatric conditions.

We tested the hypothesis that a syndrome of despair-related maladies at midlife is preceded by psychopathology during adolescence. Methods Participants are members of a representative cohort of 1037 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand in 1972-73 and followed to age 45 years, with 94% retention. Adolescent mental disorders were assessed in three diagnostic assessments at ages 11, 13, and 15 years. Indicators of despair-related maladies across four domains - suicidality, substance misuse, sleep problems, and pain - were assessed at age 45 using multi-modal measures including self-report, informant-report, and national register data. Results We identified and validated a syndrome of despair-related maladies at midlife involving suicidality, substance misuse, sleep problems, and pain. Adults who exhibited a more severe syndrome of despair-related maladies at midlife tended to have had early-onset emotional and behavioral disorders [β = 0.23, 95% CI (0.16-0.30), p < 0.001], even after adjusting for sex, childhood SES, and childhood IQ. A more pronounced midlife despair syndrome was observed among adults who, as adolescents, were diagnosed with a greater number of mental disorders [β = 0.26, 95% CI (0.19-0.33), p < 0.001]. Tests of diagnostic specificity revealed that associations generalized across different adolescent mental disorders. Conclusions Midlife adults who exhibited a more severe syndrome of despair-related maladies tended to have had psychopathology as adolescents. Prevention and treatment of adolescent psychopathology may mitigate despair-related maladies at midlife and ultimately reduce deaths of despair. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

PGD levels in parents may affect PGD levels in their adult offspring and the other way around. However, research on transmission of PGD in parent-child dyads is lacking. Consequently, we aimed to examine temporal associations between PGD levels in parent and adult children. Methods In doing so, we analyzed longitudinal self-report data on PGD levels (using the PG-13) assessed at 2, 11, 18, and 26 months after loss in 257 adult parent-child dyads from Denmark. Cross-lagged panel modeling was used for data-analyses. Results Changes in PGD levels in parents significantly predicted PGD levels in adult children, but not vice versa. Small through moderate cross-lagged effects (β = 0.05 through 0.07) were found for PGD levels in parents predicting PGD levels in adult children at a subsequent time-point. These cross-lagged effects were found while taking into account the association between PGD levels in parents and adult children at the same time-point as well as the associations between the same construct over time and relevant covariates. Conclusions Pending replication of these findings in clinical samples and younger families, our findings offer tentative support for expanding our focus in research and treatment of PGD from the individual to the family level.

Whether individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at an increased risk of being involved in these types of violence is unclear. Methods We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration CRD42022348165) of the associations between ADHD and being the victim or perpetrator of IPV and SV. Ratios of occurrence of violence were pooled in random-effects models and study risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results A search on multiple databases, carried out on 7 October 2022, yielded 14 eligible studies (1 111 557 individuals). Analyses showed a higher risk of ADHD individuals being involved in IPV as perpetrators (six studies, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.51-4.15) or victims (four studies, OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.06-3.0). Likewise, individuals with ADHD were at increased risk of being perpetrators (three studies, OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.35-5.51) or victims of SV (six studies, OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.51-2.24). Results were overall robust to different analytical choices. Conclusions Individuals with ADHD are at an increased risk of being involved in cases of violence, namely IPV and SV, either as victims or perpetrators.

The aim of the study was to determine whether DIT is an acceptable and efficacious treatment for MDD patients in China. Method Patients were randomized to 16-week treatments with either DIT plus antidepressant medication (DIT + ADM; n = 66), general supportive therapy plus antidepressant medication (GST + ADM; n = 75) or antidepressant medication alone (ADM; n = 70). The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) administered by blind raters was the primary efficacy measure. Assessments were completed during the acute 16-week treatment and up to 12-month posttreatment. Results The group × time interaction was significant for the primary outcome HAMD (F = 2.900, df1 = 10, df2 = 774.72, p = 0.001) in the acute treatment phase. Pairwise comparisons showed a benefit of DIT + ADM over ADM at weeks 12 [least-squares (LS) mean difference = -3.161, p = 0.007] and 16 (LS mean difference = -3.237, p = 0.004). Because of the unexpected high attrition during the posttreatment follow-up phase, analyses of follow-up data were considered exploratory. Differences between DIT + ADM and ADM remained significant at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up (ps range from 0.001 to 0.027). DIT + ADM had no advantage over GST + ADM during the acute treatment phase. However, at the 12-month follow-up, patients who received DIT remained less depressed. Conclusions Acute treatment with DIT or GST in combination with ADM was similarly efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms and yielded a better outcome than ADM alone. DIT may provide MDD patients with long-term benefits in symptom improvement but results must be viewed with caution.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Successful treatment of OCD is restricted by the limited knowledge about its pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of OCD using electroencephalographic (EEG) event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited from multiple tasks to characterise disorder-related differences in underlying brain activity across multiple neural processes. Methods ERP data were obtained from 25 OCD patients and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) by recording EEG during flanker and go/nogo tasks. Error-related negativity (ERN) was elicited by the flanker task, while N200 and P300 were generated using the go/nogo task. Primary comparisons of the neural response amplitudes and the topographical distribution of neural activity were conducted using scalp field differences across all time points and electrodes. Results Compared to HCs, the OCD group showed altered ERP distributions. Contrasting with the previous literature on ERN and N200 topographies in OCD where fronto-central negative voltages were reported, we detected positive voltages. Additionally, the P300 was found to be less negative in the frontal regions. None of these ERP findings were associated with OCD symptom severity. Conclusions These results indicate that individuals with OCD show altered frontal neural activity across multiple executive function-related processes, supporting the frontal dysfunction theory of OCD. Furthermore, due to the lack of association between altered ERPs and OCD symptom severity, they may be considered potential candidate endophenotypes for OCD.  © The Author(s), 2023.

The aim of this study is to examine whether cannabis use mediates the relationship between childhood adversity and psychosis. Methods Data were utilised on 881 first-episode psychosis patients and 1231 controls from the European network of national schizophrenia networks studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) study. Detailed history of cannabis use was collected with the Cannabis Experience Questionnaire. The Childhood Experience of Care and Abuse Questionnaire was used to assess exposure to household discord, sexual, physical or emotional abuse and bullying in two periods: early (0-11 years), and late (12-17 years). A path decomposition method was used to analyse whether the association between childhood adversity and psychosis was mediated by (1) lifetime cannabis use, (2) cannabis potency and (3) frequency of use. Results The association between household discord and psychosis was partially mediated by lifetime use of cannabis (indirect effect coef. 0.078, s.e. 0.022, 17%), its potency (indirect effect coef. 0.059, s.e. 0.018, 14%) and by frequency (indirect effect coef. 0.117, s.e. 0.038, 29%). Similar findings were obtained when analyses were restricted to early exposure to household discord. Conclusions Harmful patterns of cannabis use mediated the association between specific childhood adversities, like household discord, with later psychosis. Children exposed to particularly challenging environments in their household could benefit from psychosocial interventions aimed at preventing cannabis misuse. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

We examined prevalence of CM by migrant status and tested whether migrant status moderated the association between CM and first-episode psychosis (FEP). We further explored whether differences in CM exposure contributed to variations in the incidence rates of FEP by migrant status. Methods We included FEP patients aged 18-64 years in 14 European sites and recruited controls representative of the local populations. Migrant status was operationalized according to generation (first/further) and region of origin (Western/non-Western countries). The reference population was composed by individuals of host country's ethnicity. CM was assessed with Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Prevalence ratios of CM were estimated using Poisson regression. We examined the moderation effect of migrant status on the odds of FEP by CM fitting adjusted logistic regressions with interaction terms. Finally, we calculated the population attributable fractions (PAFs) for CM by migrant status. Results We examined 849 FEP cases and 1142 controls. CM prevalence was higher among migrants, their descendants and migrants of non-Western heritage. Migrant status, classified by generation (likelihood test ratio:χ2 = 11.3, p = 0.004) or by region of origin (likelihood test ratio:χ2 = 11.4, p = 0.003), attenuated the association between CM and FEP. PAFs for CM were higher among all migrant groups compared with the reference populations. Conclusions The higher exposure to CM, despite a smaller effect on the odds of FEP, accounted for a greater proportion of incident FEP cases among migrants. Policies aimed at reducing CM should consider the increased vulnerability of specific subpopulations. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We aimed to estimate longitudinal associations between stroke and psychosis over 10 years. Methods A 10-year population-based study using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. A structured health assessment recorded (i) first-occurrence stroke and (ii) psychosis, at each wave. Each were considered exposures and outcomes in separate analyses. Logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were used. Models were adjusted for demographic and health behaviour covariates, with missing covariates imputed using random forest multiple imputation. Results Of 19 808 participants, 24 reported both stroke and psychosis (median Wave 1 age 63, 71% female, 50% lowest quintile of net financial wealth) at any point during follow-up. By 10 years, the probability of an incident first stroke in participants with psychosis was 21.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.1-29.6] compared to 8.3% (95% CI 7.8-8.8) in those without psychosis (absolute difference: 13.1%; 95% CI 20.8-4.3, log rank p < 0.001; fully-adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 3.57; 95% CI 2.18-5.84). The probability of reporting incident psychosis in participants with stroke was 2.3% (95% CI 1.4-3.2) compared to 0.9% (95% CI 0.7-1.1) in those without (absolute difference: 1.4%; 95% CI 0.7-2.1, log rank p < 0.001; fully-adjusted HR: 4.98; 95% CI 2.55-9.72).

There is evidence that NSSI can be treated effectively but data on individual treatment outcomes is limited. The goal of this study was to examine response, remission, exacerbation, and relapse rates over one and two years, respectively, among a clinical sample of adolescents with NSSI. Furthermore, we aimed to identify clinically relevant predictors of NSSI trajectories. Methods The sample consists of n = 203 adolescents (12-17 y., 94% female) from a specialized outpatient clinic for risk-taking and self-harming behavior with NSSI on at least five days in the six months before first assessment. Assessments were completed at baseline and one (FU1) and two (FU2) years later using structured clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires. Results At FU1, 75% reported a reduction in NSSI frequency by at least 50% (treatment response); among those, one third (25% of the entire sample) achieved a remission (0 NSSI); an exacerbation ( © 50% more NSSI) was observed in 11% of patients. Of those in remission, 41% relapsed one year later. Predictors of non-response or non-remission were inpatient treatment and depressive symptoms. Adolescents with lower NSSI frequency at baseline had a higher risk of exacerbation. Due to limited sample size at FU2 no prediction model for relapse was established. Conclusions While most adolescents presenting with NSSI achieved significant improvement, more attention should be paid to the rather low rates of full remission.

Mechanisms leading to increased risk of illness may involve emotional dysregulation and shortened leukocyte telomere length (LTL). Methods To evaluate whether (1) childhood maltreatment is associated with shorter LTL among older adults with CAD or other chronic illnesses; (2) sex and/or CAD status influence these results; and (3) symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress moderate or mediate the association between childhood maltreatment and LTL, men and women (N = 1247; aged 65 ± 7.2 years) with and without CAD completed validated questionnaires on childhood maltreatment, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. LTL was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Analyses included bivariate correlations, hierarchical regressions, and moderation/mediation analyses, controlling for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables. Results Childhood maltreatment was associated with significantly shorter LTL (r = -0.059, p = 0.038, b = -0.016, p = 0.005). This relation was not moderated by depression, anxiety, nor perceived stress, though there was mitigated evidence for absence of a maltreatment-LTL relation in men with CAD. Stress perception (but not anxiety or depression) partially mediated the relation between childhood maltreatment and LTL [Indirect effect, b = -0.0041, s.e. = 0.002, 95% CI (-0.0085 to -0.0002)]. Conclusions Childhood maltreatment was associated with accelerated biological aging independently of patient characteristics. Emotional dysregulation resulting in chronic stress may contribute to this process. Whether stress management or other interventions may help prevent or slow premature aging in those who have suffered maltreatment requires study. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

We evaluated the polygenic contribution to comorbid depression and anxiety, and to each in isolation. Methods Diagnostic codes were extracted from electronic health records for four biobanks [N = 177 865 including 138 632 European (77.9%), 25 612 African (14.4%), and 13 621 Hispanic (7.7%) ancestry participants]. The outcome was a four-level variable representing the depression/anxiety diagnosis group: neither, depression-only, anxiety-only, and comorbid. Multinomial regression was used to test for association of depression and anxiety polygenic risk scores (PRSs) with the outcome while adjusting for principal components of ancestry. Results In total, 132 960 patients had neither diagnosis (74.8%), 16 092 depression-only (9.0%), 13 098 anxiety-only (7.4%), and 16 584 comorbid (9.3%). In the European meta-analysis across biobanks, both PRSs were higher in each diagnosis group compared to controls. Notably, depression-PRS (OR 1.20 per s.d. increase in PRS; 95% CI 1.18-1.23) and anxiety-PRS (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.05-1.09) had the largest effect when the comorbid group was compared with controls. Furthermore, the depression-PRS was significantly higher in the comorbid group than the depression-only group (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.06-1.12) and the anxiety-only group (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.11-1.19) and was significantly higher in the depression-only group than the anxiety-only group (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.09), showing a genetic risk gradient across the conditions and the comorbidity. Conclusions This study suggests that depression and anxiety have partially independent genetic liabilities and the genetic vulnerabilities to depression and anxiety make distinct contributions to comorbid depression and anxiety.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Psychedelic drugs such as LSD have been suggested to have therapeutic actions through their effects on learning. The behavioural effects of LSD in humans, however, remain incompletely understood. Here we examined how LSD affects probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) in healthy humans. Methods Healthy volunteers received intravenous LSD (75 g in 10 mL saline) or placebo (10 mL saline) in a within-subjects design and completed a PRL task. Participants had to learn through trial and error which of three stimuli was rewarded most of the time, and these contingencies switched in a reversal phase. Computational models of reinforcement learning (RL) were fitted to the behavioural data to assess how LSD affected the updating ('learning rates') and deployment of value representations ('reinforcement sensitivity') during choice, as well as 'stimulus stickiness' (choice repetition irrespective of reinforcement history). Results Raw data measures assessing sensitivity to immediate feedback ('win-stay' and 'lose-shift' probabilities) were unaffected, whereas LSD increased the impact of the strength of initial learning on perseveration. Computational modelling revealed that the most pronounced effect of LSD was the enhancement of the reward learning rate. The punishment learning rate was also elevated. Stimulus stickiness was decreased by LSD, reflecting heightened exploration. Reinforcement sensitivity differed by phase. Conclusions Increased RL rates suggest LSD induced a state of heightened plasticity. These results indicate a potential mechanism through which revision of maladaptive associations could occur in the clinical application of LSD. © The Author(s), 2022.","Article","Scopus"

This study investigated associations between childhood maltreatment, adolescent structural brain development, and mental health trajectories into young-adulthood. Methods Structural magnetic resonance imaging data was acquired from 144 youth at three time points (age 12, 16, and 18 years). Childhood maltreatment was reported to occur prior to the first scan. Linear mixed models were utilized to examine the association between total childhood maltreatment, neglect, abuse and (i) amygdala and hippocampal volume development, and (ii) maturational coupling between amygdala/hippocampus volume and the thickness of prefrontal regions. We also examined whether brain development mediated the association between maltreatment and depressive and anxiety symptoms trajectories from age 12 to 28. Results Total maltreatment, and neglect, were associated with positive maturational coupling between the amygdala and caudal anterior cingulate cortex (cACC), whereby at higher and lower levels of amygdala growth, maltreatment was associated with lower and higher PFC thinning, respectively. Neglect was also associated with maturational coupling of the hippocampus with prefrontal regions. While positive amygdala-cACC maturational coupling was associated with greater increases in anxiety symptoms, it did not significantly mediate the association between maltreatment and anxiety symptom trajectories. Conclusion We found maltreatment to be associated with altered patterns of coupling between subcortical and prefrontal regions during adolescence, suggesting that maltreatment is associated with the development of socio-emotional neural circuitry. The implications of these findings for mental health require further investigation. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

However, the neurobiological mechanisms affected by smoking, and whether they are genetically influenced, remain to be investigated. Methods Using structural magnetic resonance imaging data from the UK Biobank (n = 33 293), a brain age predictor was trained on non-smoking healthy groups and tested on smokers to obtain the BrainAge Gap (BAG). The cumulative effect of multiple common genetic variants associated with smoking was then calculated to acquire a polygenic risk score (PRS). The relationship between PRS, BAG, total gray matter volume (tGMV), and smoking parameters was explored and further genes included in the PRS were annotated to identify potential molecular mechanisms affected by smoking. Results The BrainAge in smokers was predicted with very high accuracy (r = 0.725, MAE = 4.16). Smokers had a greater BAG (Cohen's d = 0.074, p < 0.0001) and higher PRS (Cohen's d = 0.63, p < 0.0001) than non-smokers. A higher PRS was associated with increased amount of smoking, mediated by BAG and tGMV. Several neurotransmitters and ion channel pathways were enriched in the group of smoking-related genes involved in addiction, brain synaptic plasticity, and some neurological disorders. Conclusion By using a simplified single indicator of the entire brain (BAG) in combination with the PRS, this study highlights the greater BAG in smokers and its linkage with genes and smoking behavior, providing insight into the neurobiological underpinnings and potential features of smoking-related aging.

The hippocampus is an important link between depression and dementia, and it may be involved in IPS slowing in LLD. However, the relationship between a slowed IPS and the dynamic activity and connectivity of hippocampal subregions in patients with LLD remains unclear. Methods One hundred thirty-four patients with LLD and 89 healthy controls were recruited. Sliding-window analysis was used to assess whole-brain dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), dynamic fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dfALFF) and dynamic regional homogeneity (dReHo) for each hippocampal subregion seed. Results Cognitive impairment (global cognition, verbal memory, language, visual-spatial skill, executive function and working memory) in patients with LLD was mediated by their slowed IPS. Compared with the controls, patients with LLD exhibited decreased dFC between various hippocampal subregions and the frontal cortex and decreased dReho in the left rostral hippocampus. Additionally, most of the dFCs were negatively associated with the severity of depressive symptoms and were positively associated with various domains of cognitive function. Moreover, the dFC between the left rostral hippocampus and middle frontal gyrus exhibited a partial mediation effect on the relationships between the scores of depressive symptoms and IPS. Conclusions Patients with LLD exhibited decreased dFC between the hippocampus and frontal cortex, and the decreased dFC between the left rostral hippocampus and right middle frontal gyrus was involved in the underlying neural substrate of the slowed IPS. © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

The hierarchical nature of this taxonomy implies that different levels of resolution are likely to be optimal for different purposes. Our aim was to identify which level of detail is likely to provide optimal validity and explanatory power with regard to relevant clinical variables. Methods In the present report from the Rhode Island Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Services project, we used data from a sample of 2900 psychiatric outpatients to compare different levels from a bass-ackwards model of psychopathology in relation to psychosocial impairment across different domains (global functioning, inability to work, social functioning, suicidal ideation, history of suicide attempts, history of psychiatric hospitalization). Results All functioning indices were significantly associated with general psychopathology, but more complex levels provided significant incremental validity. The optimal level of complexity varied across functioning indices, suggesting that there is no single 'best' level for understanding relations between psychopathology and functioning. Conclusions Results support the hierarchical organization of psychopathology dimensions with regard to validity considerations and downstream implications for applied assessment. It would be fruitful to develop and implement measurement of these dimensions at the appropriate level for the purpose at hand. These findings can be used to guide HiTOP-consistent assessment in other research and clinical settings. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

This study examined the psychosocial moderators of HAC, determined by polygenic risk in a 10-year longitudinal study of US military veterans. We hypothesized that positive psychosocial traits (e.g. social support, personality traits, optimism, gratitude) may buffer risk of HAC in veterans with greater polygenic liability for alcohol consumption (AC). Methods Data were analyzed from 1323 European-American US veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a 10-year, nationally representative longitudinal study of US military veterans. PRS reflecting genome-wide risk for AC (AUDIT-C) was derived from a Million Veteran Program genome-wide association study (N = 200 680). Results Among the total sample, 328 (weighted 24.8%) had persistent HAC, 131 (weighted 9.9%) had new-onset HAC, 44 (weighted 3.3%) had remitted HAC, and 820 (weighted 62.0%) had no/low AC over the 10-year study period. AUDIT-C PRS was positively associated with persistent HAC relative to no/low AC [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.23-1.67] and remitted HAC (RRR = 1.63, 95% CI = 1.07-2.50). Among veterans with higher AUDIT-C PRS, greater baseline levels of agreeableness and greater dispositional gratitude were inversely associated with persistent HAC. Conclusions AUDIT-C PRS was prospectively associated with persistent HAC over a 10-year period, and agreeableness and dispositional gratitude moderated this association. Clinical interventions designed to target these modifiable psychological traits may help mitigate risk of persistent HAC in veterans with greater polygenic liability for persistent HAC.

We previously established a clear relationship between bullying and symptoms of psychosis. Similarly, we would expect sexual abuse to be linked to the emergence of psychotic symptoms, through effects on negative affect. Method We analysed English data from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys, carried out in 2007 (N = 5954) and 2014 (N = 5946), based on representative national samples living in private households. We used probabilistic graphical models represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We obtained measures of persecutory ideation and auditory hallucinosis from the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire, and identified affective symptoms using the Clinical Interview Schedule. We included cannabis consumption and sex as they may determine the relationship between symptoms. We constrained incoming edges to sexual abuse and bullying to respect temporality. Results In the DAG analyses, contrary to our expectations, paranoia appeared early in the cascade of relationships, close to the abuse variables, and generally lying upstream of affective symptoms. Paranoia was consistently directly antecedent to hallucinations, but also indirectly so, via non-psychotic symptoms. Hallucinosis was also the endpoint of pathways involving non-psychotic symptoms. Conclusions Via worry, sexual abuse and bullying appear to drive a range of affective symptoms, and in some people, these may encourage the emergence of hallucinations. The link between adverse experiences and paranoia is much more direct. These findings have implications for managing distressing outcomes. In particular, worry may be a salient target for intervention in psychosis.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Methods In early mid-life, 187 Black and 198 White (Mage = 39.4, s.d.age = 1.2) women reported on early abuse and age at first menstruation (menarche). Women provided saliva and blood to assess epigenetic aging, telomere length, and C-reactive protein. Using structural equation modeling, we created a latent variable of biological aging using epigenetic aging, telomere length, and C-reactive protein as indicators, and a latent variable of early abuse using indicators of abuse/threat events before age 13, physical abuse, and sexual abuse. We estimated the indirect effects of early abuse and of race on accelerated aging through age at menarche. Race was used as a proxy for adversity in the form of systemic racism. Results There was an indirect effect of early adversity on accelerated aging through age at menarche (b = 0.19, 95% CI 0.03-0.44), in that women who experienced more adversity were younger at menarche, which was associated with greater accelerated aging. There was also an indirect effect of race on accelerated aging through age at menarche (b = 0.25, 95% CI 0.04-0.52), in that Black women were younger at menarche, which led to greater accelerated aging. Conclusions Early abuse and being Black in the USA may both induce a phenotype of accelerated aging. Early adversity may begin to accelerate aging during childhood, in the form of early pubertal timing.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Despite its conceptual importance and its relevance, life engagement represents a largely unexplored domain in schizophrenia. The aims of the present study were to independently assess correlates and predictors of patient life engagement in a large and well-characterized sample of schizophrenia patients. Methods To assess the impact of different demographic, clinical, cognitive and functional parameters on life engagement in a large sample of patients with schizophrenia, data from the social cognition psychometric evaluation project were analyzed. Results Overall schizophrenia and depressive symptom severity, premorbid IQ, neurocognitive performance, social cognition performance both in the emotion processing and theory of mind domains, functional capacity, social skills performance and real-world functioning in different areas all emerged as correlates of patient life engagement. Greater symptom severity and greater impairment in real-world interpersonal relationships, social skills, functional capacity and work outcomes emerged as individual predictors of greater limitations in life engagement. Conclusions Life engagement in people living with schizophrenia represents a holistic and complex construct, with several different clinical, cognitive and functional correlates. These features represent potential treatment targets to improve the clinical condition and also facilitate the process of recovery and the overall well-being of people living with schizophrenia.

This is partly due to poor insight into the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive deficits. Methods The aim of this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to investigate the neuronal underpinnings of working memory (WM)-related deficits in somatically healthy, remitted patients with BD or UD (n = 66) with cognitive and functional impairments compared to 38 healthy controls (HC). The participants underwent neuropsychological testing and fMRI, while performing a visuospatial and a verbal N-back WM paradigm. Results Relative to HC, patients exhibited hypo-activity across dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as frontal and parietal nodes of the cognitive control network (CCN) and hyper-activity in left orbitofrontal cortex within the default mode network (DMN) during both visuospatial and verbal WM performance. Verbal WM-related response in the left posterior superior frontal gyrus (SFG) within CCN was lower in patients and correlated positively with out-of-scanner executive function performance across all participants. Conclusions Our findings suggest that cognitive impairments across BD and UD are associated with insufficient recruitment of task-relevant regions in the CCN and down-regulation of task-irrelevant orbitofrontal activity within the DMN during task performance. Specifically, a lower recruitment of the left posterior SFG within CCN during verbal WM was associated with lower cognitive performance.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Evaluating these associations using a network perspective yields a more complete insight than single outcome-single predictor models. Methods We used data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (N = 2498) and leveraged networks capturing associations between 30 depressive symptoms (Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology) and 46 metabolites. Analyses involved 4 steps: creating a network with Mixed Graphical Models; calculating centrality measures; bootstrapping for stability testing; validating central, stable associations by extra covariate-adjustment; and validation using another data wave collected 6 years later. Results The network yielded 28 symptom-metabolite associations. There were 15 highly-central variables (8 symptoms, 7 metabolites), and 3 stable links involving the symptoms Low energy (fatigue), and Hypersomnia. Specifically, fatigue showed consistent associations with higher mean diameter for VLDL particles and lower estimated degree of (fatty acid) unsaturation. These remained present after adjustment for lifestyle and health-related factors and using another data wave. Conclusions The somatic symptoms Fatigue and Hypersomnia and cholesterol and fatty acid measures showed central, stable, and consistent relationships in our network. The present analyses showed how metabolic alterations are more consistently linked to specific symptom profiles.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Given that cannabis use is more prevalent among people with depression, legalisation may lead to more adverse events in this population. Cannabis legalisation in Canada included the legalisation of flower and herbs (phase 1) in October 2018, and the deregulation of cannabis edibles one year later (phase 2). This study investigated disparities in cannabis-related emergency department (ED) visits in depressed and non-depressed individuals in each phase. Methods Using administrative data, we identified all adults diagnosed with depression 60 months prior to legalisation (n = 929 844). A non-depressed comparison group was identified using propensity score matching. We compared the pre-post policy differences in cannabis-related ED-visits in depressed individuals v. matched (and unmatched) non-depressed individuals. Results In the matched sample (i.e. comparison with non-depressed people similar to the depressed group), people with depression had approximately four times higher risk of cannabis-related ED-visits relative to the non-depressed over the entire period. Phases 1 and 2 were not associated with any changes in the matched depressed and non-depressed groups. In the unmatched sample (i.e. comparison with the non-depressed general population), the disparity between individuals with and without depression is greater. While phase 1 was associated with an immediate increase in ED-visits among the general population, phase 2 was not associated with any changes in the unmatched depressed and non-depressed groups. Conclusions Depression is a risk factor for cannabis-related ED-visits. Cannabis legalisation did not further elevate the risk among individuals diagnosed with depression.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Situating psychopathology and cognition as part of a unitary construct is therefore important to understanding the etiology of psychiatric disorders. The current study aims to test competing structural models of psychopathology and cognition in a large national cohort of adolescents. Methods The analytic sample consisted of 1189 participants aged 16-17 years, screened by the Israeli Draft Board. Psychopathology was assessed using a modified version of the Brief Symptom Inventory, and cognition was assessed based on four standardized test scores ((1) mathematical reasoning, concentration, and concept manipulation; (2) visual-spatial problem-solving skills and nonverbal abstract reasoning; (3) verbal understanding; (4) categorization and verbal abstraction). Confirmatory factor analysis was implemented to compare competing structural models of psychopathology with and without cognition. Sensitivity analyses examined the models in different subpopulations. Results Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a better model fit of psychopathological symptoms without cognition (RMSEA = 0.037; TLI = 0.991; CFI = 0.992) than with cognition (RMSEA = 0.04-0.042; TLI = 0.987-0.988; CFI = 0.988-0.989). Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of these results with a single exception. Among participants with low cognitive abilities (N = 139), models that integrated psychopathological symptoms with cognition had a better fit compared to models of psychopathology without cognition. Conclusions The current study suggests that cognition and psychopathology are, generally, independent constructs. However, within low cognitive abilities, cognition was integral to the structure of psychopathology. Our results point toward an increased vulnerability to psychopathology in individuals with low cognitive abilities and may provide valuable information for clinicians.  © The Author(s), 2023.

This paper compares the cost-effectiveness of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) with conventional medication, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and the combination of conventional medication and CBT. Methods: A decision model simulated patient events (response, remission, and relapse) following treatment. Data on probabilities, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were derived from previous studies or from best estimates. Expected healthcare and societal costs and QALYs over a 6-month time period were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were used to address uncertainty in parameter estimates. Results: The expected healthcare cost of PAP varied from £6132 to £7652 depending on the price of psilocybin. This compares to £3528 for conventional medication alone, £4250 for CBT alone, and £4197 for their combination. QALYs were highest for psilocybin (0.310), followed by CBT alone (0.283), conventional medication alone (0.278), and their combination (0.287). Psilocybin was shown to be cost-effective compared to the other therapies when the cost of therapist support was reduced by 50% and the psilocybin price was reduced from its initial value to £400 to £800 per person. From a societal perspective, psilocybin had improved cost-effectiveness compared to a healthcare perspective. Conclusions: Psilocybin has the potential to be a cost-effective therapy for severe depression. This depends on the level of psychological support that is given to patients receiving psilocybin and the price of the drug itself. Further data on long-term outcomes are required to improve the evidence base.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We examined group differences in performance on a ToM-related test and associations with an estimated IQ. Methods Participants [N = 1227, SZ (n = 563), ASD (n = 159), and controls (n = 505), 32.2% female] completed the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and assessments of cognitive ability. Associations between IQ and group on RMET were investigated with regression analyses. Results SZ (d = 0.73, p < 0.001) and ASD (d = 0.37, p < 0.001) performed significantly worse on the RMET than controls. SZ performed significantly worse than ASD (d = 0.32, p = 0.002). Adding IQ to the model, SZ (d = 0.60, p < 0.001) and ASD (d = 0.44, p < 0.001) continued to perform significantly worse than controls, but no longer differed from each other (d = 0.13, p = 0.30). Small significant negative correlations between symptom severity and RMET performance were found in SZ (PANSS positive: r = -0.10, negative: r = -0.11, both p < 0.05). A small non-significant negative correlation was found for Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule scores and RMET in ASD (r = -0.08, p = 0.34). Conclusions SZ and ASD are characterized by impairments in RMET. IQ contributed significantly to RMET performance and accounted for group differences in RMET between SZ and ASD. This suggests that non-social cognitive ability needs to be included in comparative studies of the two disorders.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods Using data from Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; N = 34 653), the current study examined variation in functioning, symptomology and aetiological risk across the psychosis phenotype [i.e. variation from (i) no PEs, 'No PEs' to (ii) non-distressing PEs, 'PE-Experienced Only' to (iii) distressing PEs, 'PE-Impaired' to (iv) clinically defined psychotic disorder, 'Diagnosed']. Results A graded trend was present such that, compared to those with no PEs, the Diagnosed group had the poorest functioning, followed by the PE-Impaired then PE-Experienced Only groups. In relation to symptom expression, the PE-Impaired group were more likely than the PE-Experienced Only and the Diagnosed groups to endorse most PEs. Predictors of group membership tended to vary quantitatively rather than qualitatively. Trauma, current mental health diagnoses (anxiety and depression) and drug use variables differentiated between all levels of the continuum, with the exception of the extreme end (PE-Impaired v. Diagnosed). Only a few variables distinguished groups at the upper end of the continuum: female sex, older age, unemployment, parental mental health hospitalisation and lower likelihood of having experienced physical assault. Conclusions The findings highlight the importance of continuum-based interpretations of the psychosis phenotype and afford valuable opportunities to consider if and how impairment, symptom expression and risk change along the continuum.

These psychopathologies show overlapping neural dysfunction in the form of reduced recruitment of reward processing neuro-circuitries. However, it is unclear to what extent these psychopathologies show common v. different neural dysfunctions as a function of symptom profiles, as no studies have directly compared neural dysfunctions associated with each of these psychopathologies to each other. Methods In study 1, a latent profile analysis (LPA) was conducted in a sample of 266 adolescents (aged 13-18, 41.7% female, 58.3% male) from a residential youth care facility and the surrounding community to investigate substance use, externalizing and attention problems, and ELS psychopathologies and their co-presentation. In study 2, we examined a subsample of 174 participants who completed the Passive Avoidance learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine differential and/or common reward processing neuro-circuitry dysfunctions associated with symptom profiles based on these co-presentations. Results In study 1, LPA identified profiles of substance use plus rule-breaking behaviors, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and ELS. In study 2, the substance use/rule-breaking profile was associated with reduced recruitment of reward processing and attentional neuro-circuitries during the Passive Avoidance task (p < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Conclusions Findings indicate that there is reduced responsivity of striato-cortical regions when receiving outcomes on an instrumental learning task within a profile of adolescents with substance use and rule-breaking behaviors. Mitigating reward processing dysfunction specifically may represent a potential intervention target for substance-use psychopathologies accompanied by rule-breaking behaviors.  © The Author(s), 2023.

This study identifies differences in the clinically observable phenome across a wide variety of physical and mental disorders comparing patients with diagnoses of depression without anxiety, anxiety without depression, or both depression and anxiety. Methods Using electronic health records for 14 994 participants with depression and/or anxiety in the Mayo Clinic Biobank, a phenotype-based phenome-wide association study (Phe2WAS) was performed to test for differences between these groups across a broad range of clinical diagnoses observed in the electronic health record. Additional analyses were performed to determine the temporal sequencing of diagnoses. Results Compared to patients diagnosed only with anxiety, those diagnosed only with depression were more likely to have diagnoses of obesity (OR 1.75; p = 1 × 10-27), sleep apnea (OR 1.71; p = 1 × 10-22), and type II diabetes (OR 1.74; p = 9 × 10-18). Compared to those diagnosed only with depression, those diagnosed only with anxiety were more likely to have diagnoses of palpitations (OR 1.91; p = 2 × 10-25), benign skin neoplasms (OR 1.61; p = 2 × 10-17), and cardiac dysrhythmias (OR 1.45; p = 2 × 10-12). Patients with comorbid depression and anxiety were more likely to have diagnoses of other mental health disorders, substance use disorders, sleep problems, and gastroesophageal reflux relative to isolated depression. Conclusions While depression and anxiety are closely related, this study suggests that phenotypic distinctions exist between depression and anxiety. Improving phenotypic characterization within the broad categories of depression and anxiety could improve the clinical assessment of depression and anxiety.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies testing factors associated with UM as compared to bipolar disorder with a manic-depressive course (md-BD). Methods Studies indexed up to July 2022 in main electronic databases were searched. Random-effects meta-analyses of the association between UM and relevant correlates yielded odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Based on data from 21 studies, factors positively or negatively associated with UM, as compared to md-BD, were: male gender (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.11-1.94); age at onset (SMD -0.25; 95% CI -0.46 to -0.04); number of hospitalizations (SMD 0.53; 95% CI 0.21-0.84); family history of depression (OR 0.55; 95% CI 0.36-0.85); suicide attempts (OR 0.25; 95% CI 0.19-0.34); comorbid anxiety disorders (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.26-0.49); psychotic features (OR 2.16; 95% CI 1.55-3.00); hyperthymic temperament (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.17-3.40). The quality of evidence for the association with previous suicide attempts was high, moderate for anxiety disorders and psychotic features, and low or very low for other correlates. Conclusions Despite the heterogeneous quality of evidence, this work supports the hypothesis that UM might represent a distinctive diagnostic construct, with peculiar clinical correlates. Additional research is needed to better differentiate UM in the context of affective disorders, favouring personalized care approaches.  © The Author(s), 2023.

The brain is a target organ for both obesity and BD. Yet, we do not understand how cortical brain alterations in BD and obesity interact. Methods: We obtained body mass index (BMI) and MRI-derived regional cortical thickness, surface area from 1231 BD and 1601 control individuals from 13 countries within the ENIGMA-BD Working Group. We jointly modeled the statistical effects of BD and BMI on brain structure using mixed effects and tested for interaction and mediation. We also investigated the impact of medications on the BMI-related associations. Results: BMI and BD additively impacted the structure of many of the same brain regions. Both BMI and BD were negatively associated with cortical thickness, but not surface area. In most regions the number of jointly used psychiatric medication classes remained associated with lower cortical thickness when controlling for BMI. In a single region, fusiform gyrus, about a third of the negative association between number of jointly used psychiatric medications and cortical thickness was mediated by association between the number of medications and higher BMI. Conclusions: We confirmed consistent associations between higher BMI and lower cortical thickness, but not surface area, across the cerebral mantle, in regions which were also associated with BD. Higher BMI in people with BD indicated more pronounced brain alterations. BMI is important for understanding the neuroanatomical changes in BD and the effects of psychiatric medications on the brain.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Stress, a known risk factor for psychosis in the general population, has seldom been studied in 22q11Del. We investigated how lifetime stressors related to symptomatic outcomes in patients with 22q11Del. We also explored this association in individuals with 22q11.2 duplications (22q11Dup), which may be potentially protective against psychosis. Method One hundred individuals (46 with 22q11Del, 30 with 22q11Dup, and 24 healthy controls; Mage = 17.30 years±10.15) were included. Logistic models were used to examine cross-sectional associations between lifetime acute and chronic stressors (severity and count) and the presence (score  © 3) of positive, negative, and general symptoms, assessed via the Structured Interview for Psychosis-risk Syndromes (SIPS). Results The 22q11Dup group reported the greatest number and severity of acute lifetime stressors, but did not differ from 22q11Del in chronic stressor count or severity. Lifetime chronic and acute stressors were uniquely associated with positive symptoms in 22q11Del (chronic count: odds ratio [OR] = 2.35, p = 0.02; chronic severity: OR = 1.88, p = 0.03; acute count: OR = 1.78, p = 0.03), but not with negative or general symptoms (ps > 0.05). Conclusion Findings suggest that stress may play a role in psychotic symptoms in 22q1Del, while the 22q11Dup CNV appears protective against psychotic symptoms despite higher rates of stressors. Interventions that mitigate effects of stressors in 22qDel may reduce the odds of psychosis in this group. Prospective longitudinal research is needed to replicate these findings.

Less is known about the drugs' mortality risk or whether serious mental illness (SMI) diagnosis or race/ethnicity modify these effects. Methods Authors created a retrospective cohort of non-elderly adults with SMI initiating monotherapy with an SGA (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone, aripiprazole) or haloperidol during 2008-2013. Three-year diabetes incidence or all-cause death risk differences were estimated between each drug and aripiprazole, the comparator, as well as effects within SMI diagnosis and race/ethnicity. Sensitivity analyses evaluated potential confounding by indication. Results 38 762 adults, 65% White and 55% with schizophrenia, initiated monotherapy, with haloperidol least (6%) and quetiapine most (26·5%) frequent. Three-year mortality was 5% and diabetes incidence 9.3%. Compared with aripiprazole, haloperidol and olanzapine reduced diabetes risk by 1.9 (95% CI 1.2-2.6) percentage points, or a 18.6 percentage point reduction relative to aripiprazole users' unadjusted risk (10.2%), with risperidone having a smaller advantage. Relative to aripiprazole users' unadjusted risk (3.4%), all antipsychotics increased mortality risk by 1.1-2.2 percentage points, representing 32.4-64.7 percentage point increases. Findings within diagnosis and race/ethnicity were generally consistent with overall findings. Only quetiapine's higher mortality risk held in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Haloperidol's, olanzapine's, and risperidone's lower diabetes risks relative to aripiprazole were not robust in sensitivity analyses but quetiapine's higher mortality risk proved robust. Findings expand the evidence on antipsychotics' risks, suggesting a need for caution in the use of quetiapine among individuals with SMI.  Copyright © RAND Corporation and the Author(s), 2023.

We estimated the association between antidepressant medication and CVD by applying a marginal structural model. Methods We analyzed medical utilization records of 27 170 people with PTSD without prior major cardiovascular events in the Korean National Health Insurance Database (NHID). PTSD and CVD were defined in accordance with the recorded ICD-10 diagnostic codes. We acquired information on antidepressant use from the NHID and categorized them by medication type. A composite major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) outcome was defined as coronary artery disease with revascularization, ischaemic stroke, and/or haemorrhagic stroke. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to estimate the parameters of a marginal structural discrete-time survival analysis regression model, comparing the resulting estimates to those derived from traditional time-fixed and time-varying Cox proportional hazards regression. We calculated cumulative daily defined doses to test for a dose-response relationship. Results People exposed to antidepressants showed a higher hazard of MACE [hazard ratio (HR) 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.53]. The estimated effects were strongest for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.08-1.44) and TCAs (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.56). Exposure to serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors did not appear to increase the risk of MACE. People exposed to higher doses of antidepressants showed higher risk of MACE. Conclusions In a national cohort of people with PTSD, exposure to antidepressant medications increased the risk of MACE in a dose-response fashion.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

By the end of 2021, more than 260 million people worldwide had been infected and 5.2 million people had died because of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Various countermeasures have been implemented to contain the infections, depending on the country, infection prevalence, and political and infrastructural resources. The pandemic and the containment measures have induced diverse psychological burdens. Using internet queries as a proxy, this study examines the psychological consequences on a European level of SARS-CoV-2 containment measures. Methods Using informetric analyses, this study reviews within 32 European countries a total of 28 search parameters derived from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as aspects of affective disorder. Results Our results show that there are several psychological aspects which are significantly emphasized during the pandemic and its containment measures: 'anxiety', 'dejection', 'weariness', 'listlessness', 'loss of appetite', 'loss of libido', 'panic attack', and 'worthlessness'. These terms are significantly more frequently part of a search query during the pandemic than before the outbreak. Furthermore, our results revealed that search parameters such as 'psychologist', 'psychotherapist', 'psychotherapy' have increased highly significantly (p < 0.01) since the pandemic. Conclusions The psychological distress caused by the pandemic correlates significantly with the frequency of people searching for psychological and psychotherapeutic support on the Internet.

Methods We used data from 11 sites of the multicentre European Gene-Environment Interaction (EU-GEI) case-control study. 558 first-episode psychosis patients (FEPp) and 567 population controls who had used cannabis and reported their RFUC. We ran logistic regressions to examine whether RFUC were associated with first-episode psychosis (FEP) case-control status. Path analysis then examined the relationship between RFUC, subsequent patterns of cannabis use, and case-control status. Results Controls (86.1%) and FEPp (75.63%) were most likely to report 'because of friends' as their most common RFUC. However, 20.1% of FEPp compared to 5.8% of controls reported: 'to feel better' as their RFUC (χ2 = 50.97; p < 0.001). RFUC 'to feel better' was associated with being a FEPp (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.03-2.95) while RFUC 'with friends' was associated with being a control (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.37-0.83). The path model indicated an association between RFUC 'to feel better' with heavy cannabis use and with FEPp-control status. Conclusions Both FEPp and controls usually started using cannabis with their friends, but more patients than controls had begun to use 'to feel better'. People who reported their reason for first using cannabis to 'feel better' were more likely to progress to heavy use and develop a psychotic disorder than those reporting 'because of friends'.

While it appears that psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are strongly associated with both SI and SB at different points across the lifespan, the longitudinal nature of this relationship in middle childhood and early adolescence is understudied. Methods The study used the unique longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study data. Mixed effects linear models examined associations between PLEs and SI and SB over time using three time points of data from ages 9-13. Results First, analyses indicated that endorsement of SI and SB increased as youth grew older for those with increased distressing PLEs. Analyses found evidence of bidirectional relationships between PLEs with SI and SB, with evidence that PLEs at baseline were associated with worsening SI and SB over time, including a transition from SI to SB (β = 0.032, FDRp = 0.002). Exploratory analyses showed consistent evidence for strengthened associations over time for higher delusional ideation with both SI and SB (βs > 0.04, FDRps < 0.001), and for perceptual distortions with SB (βs = 0.046, FDRp < 0.001). When accounting for general psychopathology, for SB, the strengthened associations over time was significantly stronger for PLEs (β = 0.053, FDRp < 0.001) compared to general psychopathology (β = 0.022, FDRp = 0.01). Conclusions The present study indicates both SI and SB show strengthened associations with PLEs over time, and that baseline PLEs may predict worsening of suicidality over time.

Therefore, we sought to identify related conversion rates and risk factors. Methods This cohort study included the Swedish population born from 1941 onward. Data were collected from Swedish population-based registers. Potential risk factors, including family genetic risk scores (FGRS), which were calculated based on the phenotypes of relatives in the extended family and not molecular data, and demographic/clinical characteristics from these registers were retrieved. Those with first MD registrations from 2006 were followed up until 2018. The conversion rate to BD and related risk factors were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. Additional analyses were performed for late converters and with stratification by sex. Results The cumulative incidence of conversion was 5.84% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 5.72-5.96] for 13 years. In the multivariable analysis, the strongest risk factors for conversion were high FGRS of BD [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.73, 95% CI 2.43-3.08], inpatient treatment settings (HR = 2.64, 95% CI 2.44-2.84), and psychotic depression (HR = 2.58, 95% CI 2.14-3.11). For late converters, the first registration of MD during the teenage years was a stronger risk factor when compared with the baseline model. When the interactions between risk factors and sex were significant, stratification by sex revealed that they were more predictive in females. Conclusions Family history of BD, inpatient treatment, and psychotic symptoms were the strongest predictors of conversion from MD to BD.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

However, little is known about its neurobiological mechanism concerning the brain network changes accompanying pharmacotherapy. The present study investigated the changes in the intrinsic brain networks during 6-month antidepressant treatment phase associated with the treatment response and recurrence in MDD. Methods Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired from untreated patients with MDD and healthy controls at baseline. The patients' depressive symptoms were monitored by using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). After 6 months of antidepressant treatment, patients were re-scanned and followed up every 6 months over 2 years. Traditional statistical analysis as well as machine learning approaches were conducted to investigate the longitudinal changes in macro-scale resting-state functional network connectivity (rsFNC) strength and micro-scale resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) associated with long-term treatment outcome in MDD. Results Repeated measures of the general linear model demonstrated a significant difference in the default mode network (DMN) rsFNC change before and after the 6-month antidepressant treatment between remitters and non-remitters. The difference in the rsFNC change over the 6-month antidepressant treatment between recurring and stable MDD was also specific to DMN. Machine learning analysis results revealed that only the DMN rsFC change successfully distinguished non-remitters from the remitters at 6 months and recurring from stable MDD during the 2-year follow-up. Conclusion Our findings demonstrated that the intrinsic DMN connectivity could be a unique and important target for treatment and recurrence prevention in MDD. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This study examined associations between (1) GNC and mental health over multiple time points in childhood and adolescence, and (2) GNC in childhood and/or adolescence and mental health in adulthood. Method Second generation participants from the Raine Study, a longitudinal cohort from Perth, Western Australia. Data were collected between 1995 and 2018, comprising seven waves: ages 5 (N = 2236), 8 (N = 2140), 10 (N = 2048), 14 (N = 1864), 17 (N = 1726), 22 (N = 1236) and 27 (N = 1190) years. History of GNC, v. absence of this history, was based on responses to item 110 from the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL)/Youth Self Report (YSR) ('wishes to be of opposite sex'). The CBCL/YSR were used to measure internalising and externalising symptoms. Items 18 ('deliberate self-harm [DSH] or attempts suicide') and 91 ('talks/thinks about killing self') were used as measures of suicidal ideation (SI) and DSH. For adults, Depression, Anxiety and Stress Subscales and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale assessed mental health. Results Child and adolescent GNC was associated with elevated internalising and externalising behaviours and increased odds of DSH. A history of GNC was also associated with vulnerability for severe psychological distress in adulthood in some symptom scales. Conclusion GNC over the child and adolescent period is associated with significant emotional and behavioural difficulties, and psychological distress. A history of GNC in childhood and/or adolescence also predicts poorer mental health in adulthood on multiple symptom domains.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Recent work has begun to examine how environmental contexts (e.g. locations) influence negative symptoms. However, limited work has evaluated how environments may contribute to negative symptoms among youth at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). The current study uses Ecological Momentary Assessment to assess how four environmental contexts (locations, activities, social interactions, social interaction method) impact state fluctuations in negative symptoms in CHR and healthy control (CN) participants. Methods CHR youth (n = 116) and CN (n = 61) completed 8 daily surveys for 6 days assessing negative symptoms and contexts. Results Mixed-effects modeling demonstrated that negative symptoms largely varied across contexts in both groups. CHR participants had higher negative symptoms than CN participants in most contexts, but groups had similar symptom reductions during recreational activities and phone call interactions. Among CHR participants, negative symptoms were elevated in several contexts, including studying/working, commuting, eating, running errands, and being at home. Conclusions Results demonstrate that negative symptoms dynamically change across some contexts in CHR participants. Negative symptoms were more intact in some contexts, while other contexts, notably some used to promote functional recovery, may exacerbate negative symptoms in CHR. Findings suggest that environmental factors should be considered when understanding state fluctuations in negative symptoms among those at CHR participants.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

In this brief report, we investigated whether deficits in adequately interpreting the likelihood of a medical disease may contribute to this difficulty, and whether patients' concerns are altered by different likelihood framings. Methods Patients with SFD (N = 60), patients with major depression (N = 32), and healthy volunteers (N = 37) were presented with varying likelihoods for the presence of a serious medical disease and were asked how concerned they are about it. The likelihood itself was varied, as was the format in which it was presented (i.e. negative framing focusing on the presence of a disease v. positive framing emphasizing its absence; use of natural frequencies v. percentages). Results Patients with SFD reported significantly more concern than depressed patients and healthy people in response to low likelihoods (i.e. 1: 100 000 to 1:10), while the groups were similarly concerned for likelihoods © 1:5. Across samples, the same mathematical likelihood caused significantly different levels of concern depending on how it was framed, with the lowest degree of concern for a positive framing approach and higher concern for natural frequencies (e.g. 1:100) than for percentages (e.g. 1%). Conclusions The results suggest a specific deficit of patients with SFD in interpreting low likelihoods for the presence of a medical disease. Positive framing approaches and the use of percentages rather than natural frequencies can lower the degree of concern.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Although the prefrontal cortex and limbic areas are important regulators of the HPA axis, whether the neural habituation of these regions during stress signals both blunted HPA axis responses and psychiatric symptoms remains unclear. In this study, neural habituation during acute stress and its associations with the stress cortisol response, resilience, and depression were evaluated. Methods Seventy-seven participants (17-22 years old, 37 women) were recruited for a ScanSTRESS brain imaging study, and the activation changes between the first and last stress blocks were used as the neural habituation index. Meanwhile, participants' salivary cortisol during test was collected. Individual-level resilience and depression were measured using questionnaires. Correlation and moderation analyses were conducted to investigate the association between neural habituation and endocrine data and mental symptoms. Validated analyses were conducted using a Montreal Image Stress Test dataset in another independent sample (48 participants; 17-22 years old, 24 women). Results Neural habituation of the prefrontal cortex and limbic area was negatively correlated with cortisol responses in both datasets. In the ScanSTRESS paradigm, neural habituation was both positively correlated with depression and negatively correlated with resilience. Moreover, resilience moderated the relationship between neural habituation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and cortisol response. Conclusions This study suggested that neural habituation of the prefrontal cortex and limbic area could reflect motivation dysregulation during repeated failures and negative feedback, which might further lead to maladaptive mental states.

However, the definition of early AAO remains unprecise. We thus tested which age cut-off for early AAO best corresponds to distinguishable neurodevelopmental pathways. Methods We analyzed data from the FondaMental Advanced Center of Expertise-Bipolar Disorder cohort, a naturalistic sample of 4421 patients. First, a supervised learning framework was applied in binary classification experiments using neurodevelopmental history to predict early AAO, defined either with Gaussian mixture models (GMM) clustering or with each of the different cut-offs in the range 14 to 25 years. Second, an unsupervised learning approach was used to find clusters based on neurodevelopmental factors and to examine the overlap between such data-driven groups and definitions of early AAO used for supervised learning. Results A young cut-off, i.e. 14 up to 16 years, induced higher separability [mean nested cross-validation test AUROC = 0.7327 (± 0.0169) for 16 years]. Predictive performance deteriorated increasing the cut-off or setting early AAO with GMM. Similarly, defining early AAO below 17 years was associated with a higher degree of overlap with data-driven clusters (Normalized Mutual Information = 0.41 for 17 years) relatively to other definitions. Conclusions Early AAO best captures distinctive neurodevelopmental patterns when defined as 17 years. GMM-based definition of early AAO falls short of mapping to highly distinguishable neurodevelopmental pathways. These results should be used to improve patients' stratification in future studies of BD pathophysiology and biomarkers. © Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone, 2023.","Article","Scopus"

However not all cases of MCI-LB will feature AD pathology. Disease-general biomarkers of neurodegeneration, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or neurofilament light (NfL), may therefore provide a useful supplement to AD biomarkers. We aimed to compare the relative utility of plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau181, GFAP and NfL in differentiating MCI-AD and MCI-LB from cognitively healthy older adults, and from one another. Methods Plasma samples were analysed for 172 participants (31 healthy controls, 48 MCI-AD, 28 possible MCI-LB and 65 probable MCI-LB) at baseline, and a subset (n = 55) who provided repeated samples after ≥1 year. Samples were analysed with a Simoa 4-plex assay for Aβ42, Aβ40, GFAP and NfL, and incorporated previously-collected p-tau181 from this same cohort. Results Probable MCI-LB had elevated GFAP (p < 0.001) and NfL (p = 0.012) relative to controls, but not significantly lower Aβ42/40 (p = 0.06). GFAP and p-tau181 were higher in MCI-AD than MCI-LB. GFAP discriminated all MCI subgroups, from controls (AUC of 0.75), but no plasma-based marker effectively differentiated MCI-AD from MCI-LB. NfL correlated with disease severity and increased with MCI progression over time (p = 0.011). Conclusion Markers of AD and astrocytosis/neurodegeneration are elevated in MCI-LB. GFAP offered similar utility to p-tau181 in distinguishing MCI overall, and its subgroups, from healthy controls.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Building on this research, we use an innovative method to measure early adversity while drawing upon a biopsychosocial perspective on health to formulate a model that specifies indirect pathways whereby childhood and adolescent adversity become biologically embedded and influence adult health. Method Using nearly 20 years of longitudinal data from 382 Black Americans, we use repeated-measures latent class analysis (RMLCA) to construct measures of childhood/adolescent adversities and their trajectories. Then, we employ structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of childhood/adolescent adversity on health outcomes in adulthood through psychosocial maladjustment. Results RMLCA identified two classes for each component of childhood/adolescent adversity across the ages of 10 to 18, suggesting that childhood/adolescent social adversities exhibit a prolonged heterogeneous developmental trajectory. The models controlled for early and adult mental health, sociodemographic and health-related covariates. Psychosocial maladjustment, measured by low self-esteem, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and lack of self-control, mediated the relationship between childhood/adolescent adversity, especially parental hostility, racial discrimination, and socioeconomic class, and both self-reported illness and blood-based accelerated biological aging (with proportion mediation ranging from 8.22% to 79.03%). Conclusion The results support a biopsychosocial model of health and provide further evidence that, among Black Americans, early life social environmental experiences, especially parenting, financial stress, and racial discrimination, are associated with adult health profiles, and furthermore, psychosocial mechanisms mediate this association.

Methods Using data from the UK Biobank, this study utilized a series of linear regressions to compare individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) (n = 566) v. lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone (n = 3447) on within- and between- network resting-state functional connectivity subnetworks. Results There were no significant between-group differences for between-network, within-network, or whole-brain functional connectivity after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index and performing statistical corrections for multiple comparisons. Resting-state network measures may not differentiate between individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) and lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone. Conclusions Null findings diverge from results reported in smaller neuroimaging studies of suicide risk, but are consistent with null findings in other large-scale studies and meta-analyses.

There is a high prevalence of stress-response and affective disorders among cardiac patients, which might be negatively associated with their PA. This study aimed at investigating daily differential associations of International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 adjustment disorder, depression and anxiety symptoms with PA and sedentary behaviour (SB) during and right after inpatient cardiac rehabilitation. Methods The sample included N = 129 inpatients in cardiac rehabilitation, Mage = 62.2, s.d.age = 11.3, 84.5% male, n = 2845 days. Adjustment disorder, depression and anxiety symptoms were measured daily during the last 7 days of rehabilitation and for 3 weeks after discharge. Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), light PA (LPA) and SB were measured with an accelerometer. Bayesian lagged multilevel regressions including all three symptoms to obtain their unique effects were conducted. Results On days with higher adjustment disorder symptoms than usual, patients engaged in less MVPA, and more SB. Patients with overall higher depression symptoms engaged in less MVPA, less LPA and more SB. On days with higher depression symptoms than usual, there was less MVPA and LPA, and more SB.

Methods Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a UK-based birth cohort study, were used to estimate prevalence of self-reported engagement in self-harm, violence, and dual harm at ages 16 and 22 years. Risk ratios were calculated to indicate associations across various self-reported childhood risk factors and risks of single and dual harm, including the transition from single harm at age 16 years to dual harm at age 22. Results At age 16 years, 18.1% of the 4176 cohort members had harmed themselves, 21.1% had engaged in violence towards others and 3.7% reported dual harm. At age 22 the equivalent prevalence estimates increased to 24.2, 25.8 and 6.8%, respectively. Depression and other mental health difficulties, drug and alcohol use, witnessing self-harm and being a victim of, or witnessing, violence were associated with higher risks of transitioning from self-harm or violence at age 16 to dual harm by age 22. Conclusions Prevalence of dual harm doubled from age 16 to 22 years, highlighting the importance of early identification and intervention during this high-risk period. Several childhood psychosocial risk factors associated specifically with dual harm at age 16 and with the transition to dual harm by age 22 have been identified.  © The Author(s), 2023.

While manic and depressive symptoms can alternate and co-occur, most of the studies in early intervention investigated these symptoms independently. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the co-occurrence of manic and depressive dimensions, their evolution and impact on outcomes. Methods We prospectively studied first-episode psychosis patients (N = 313) within an early intervention program over 3 years. Based on latent transition analysis, we identified sub-groups of patients with different mood profiles considering both manic and depressive dimensions, and studied their outcomes. Results Our results revealed six different mood profiles at program entry and after 1.5 years follow-up (absence of mood disturbance, co-occurrence, mild depressive, severe depressive, manic and hypomanic), and four after 3 years (absence of mood disturbance, co-occurrence, mild depressive and hypomanic). Patients with absence of mood disturbance at discharge had better outcomes. All patients with co-occurring symptoms at program entry remained symptomatic at discharge. Patients with mild depressive symptoms were less likely to return to premorbid functional level at discharge than the other subgroups. Patients displaying a depressive component had poorer quality of physical and psychological health at discharge. Conclusions Our results confirm the major role played by mood dimensions in early psychosis, and show that profiles with co-occurring manic and depressive dimensions are at risk of poorer outcome. An accurate assessment and treatment of these dimensions in people with early psychosis is crucial.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

While there is strong evidence proving its efficacy, the mechanisms of reduction in tic severity during CBIT are still poorly understood. In a recent study, our group identified a functional brain network involved in tic suppression in children with TS. We reasoned that voluntary tic suppression and CBIT may share some mechanisms and thus we wanted to assess whether functional connectivity during tic suppression was associated with CBIT outcome. Methods Thirty-two children with TS, aged 8 to 13 years old, participated in a randomized controlled trial of CBIT v. a treatment-as-usual control condition. EEG was recorded during tic suppression in all participants at baseline and endpoint. We used a source-reconstructed EEG connectivity pipeline to assess functional connectivity during tic suppression. Results Functional connectivity during tic suppression did not change from baseline to endpoint. However, baseline tic suppression-related functional connectivity specifically predicted the decrease in vocal tic severity from baseline to endpoint in the CBIT group. Supplementary analyses revealed that the functional connectivity between the right superior frontal gyrus and the right angular gyrus was mainly driving this effect. Conclusions This study revealed that functional connectivity during tic suppression at baseline predicted reduction in vocal tic severity. These results suggest probable overlap between the mechanisms of voluntary tic suppression and those of behavior therapy for tics.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Methods To test these relative contributions, a consortium of indigenous researchers collected Adult Self-Report (ASR) ratings from 16 906 18- to 59-year-olds in 28 societies that represented seven culture clusters identified in the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavioral Effectiveness study (e.g. Confucian, Anglo). The ASR is scored on 17 problem scales, plus a personal strengths scale. Hierarchical linear modeling estimated variance accounted for by individual differences (including measurement error), society, and culture cluster. Multi-level analyses of covariance tested age and gender effects. Results Across the 17 problem scales, the variance accounted for by individual differences ranged from 80.3% for DSM-oriented anxiety problems to 95.2% for DSM-oriented avoidant personality (mean = 90.7%); by society: 3.2% for DSM-oriented somatic problems to 8.0% for DSM-oriented anxiety problems (mean = 6.3%); and by culture cluster: 0.0% for DSM-oriented avoidant personality to 11.6% for DSM-oriented anxiety problems (mean = 3.0%). For strengths, individual differences accounted for 80.8% of variance, societal differences 10.5%, and cultural differences 8.7%. Age and gender had very small effects. Conclusions Overall, adults' self-ratings of mental health problems and strengths were associated much more with individual differences than societal/cultural differences, although this varied across scales. These findings support cross-cultural use of standardized measures to assess mental health problems, but urge caution in assessment of personal strengths.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

We assessed the effectiveness of a fully automated aviophobia smartphone app treatment delivered in combination with a $5 virtual reality (VR) viewer. Methods In total, 153 participants from the Dutch general population with aviophobia symptoms and smartphone access were randomized in a single-blind randomized controlled trial to either an automated VR cognitive behavior therapy (VR-CBT) app treatment condition (n = 77) or a wait-list control condition (n = 76). The VR-CBT app was delivered over a 6-week period in the participants' natural environment. Online self-report assessments were completed at baseline, post-treatment, at 3-month and at 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the Flight Anxiety Situations Questionnaire (FAS). Analyses were based on intent-to-treat. Results A significant reduction of aviophobia symptoms at post-test for the VR-CBT app compared with the control condition [p < 0.001; d = 0. 98 (95% CI 0.65-1.32)] was demonstrated. The dropout rate was 21%. Results were maintained at 3-month follow-up [within-group d = 1.14 (95% CI 0.46-1.81)] and at 12-month follow-up [within-group d = 1.12 (95% CI 0.46-1.79)]. Six participants reported adverse effects of cyber sickness symptoms. Conclusions This study is the first to show that fully automated mobile VR-CBT therapy delivered in a natural setting can maintain long-term effectiveness in reducing aviophobia symptoms. In doing so, it offers an accessible and scalable evidence-based treatment solution that can be applied globally at a fraction of the cost of current treatment alternatives.

Method The study included 44 506 patients who had previously attended Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services in the London Borough of Lambeth. Multinomial logistic regression examined cross-sectional associations between ethnicity with physical and mental multimorbidity. Patterns of multimorbidity were identified using hierarchical cluster analysis. Results Within 44 056 working age adults with a history of depression or anxiety from South London there were notable ethnic differences in physical multimorbidity. Adults of Black Caribbean ethnicity were more likely to have physical multimorbidity [adjusted relative risk ratio (aRRR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15-1.36] compared to adults of White ethnicity. Relative to adults of White ethnicity, adults of Asian ethnicity were more likely to have physical multimorbidity at higher thresholds only (e.g. 4 + conditions; aRRR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.17-2.00). Three physical (atopic, cardiometabolic, mixed) and three mental (alcohol/substance use, common/severe mental illnesses, personality disorder) multimorbidity clusters emerged. Ethnic minority groups with multimorbidity had a higher probability of belonging to the cardiometabolic cluster. Conclusion In an ethnically diverse population with a history of common mental health disorders, we found substantial between- and within-ethnicity variation in rates of physical, but not mental, multimorbidity.

We aimed to evaluate the potential causal relationship of MDD with 4 GID [gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)] using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design. Methods We obtained genome-wide association data for MDD from a meta-analysis (N = 480 359), and for GID from the UK Biobank (N ranges: 332 601-486 601) and FinnGen (N ranges: 187 028-218 792) among individuals of European ancestry. Our primary method was inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR, with a series of sensitivity analyses to test the hypothesis of MR. Individual study estimates were pooled using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Results Meta-analyses IVW MR found evidence that genetically predicted MDD may increase the risk of GERD, IBS, PUD and NAFLD. Additionally, reverse MR found evidence of genetically predicted GERD or IBS may increase the risk of MDD. Conclusions Genetically predicted MDD may increase the risk of GERD, IBS, PUD and NAFLD. Genetically predicted GERD or IBS may increase the risk of MDD. The findings may help elucidate the mechanisms underlying the co-morbidity of MDD and GID.

The aim of this study is to examine the prospective relationship between maternal religiosity and offspring mental health and psychosocial outcomes. Methods We used latent classes of religious belief (Highly religious, Moderately religious, Agnostic, Atheist) in mothers from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children from 1990, and examined their association with parent-reported mental health outcomes and self-reported psychosocial outcomes in their children at age 7-8 (n = 6079 for mental health outcomes and n = 5235 for psychosocial outcomes). We used inverse probability weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for maternal mental health, adverse childhood experience, and socioeconomic variables. Results There was evidence for a greater risk of internalising problems among the offspring of the Highly religious and Moderately religious classes [e.g. for depression; OR 1.40. 95% CI (1.07-1.85), OR 1.48, 95% CI (1.17-1.87)], and greater risk of externalising problems in the offspring of the Atheist class [e.g. for ADHD; OR 1.41, 95% CI (1.08-1.85)], compared to the offspring of the Agnostic class. Conclusions These novel findings provide evidence associations between maternal religiosity and offspring mental health differ when examined using a person-centred approach, compared to the previously used variable-centred approaches.

Results Children with lower accuracy on No-Go trials compared to Go trials in early childhood (F(1,101) = 3.976, p = 0.049), evidenced higher PLEs at the transition to adolescence 4-9 years later, reflecting a specific deficit in inhibitory control. No association was observed with internalizing or externalizing symptoms. Decreased accuracy during the frustration manipulation predicted higher internalizing, F(2,202) = 5.618, p = 0.004, and externalizing symptoms, F(2,202) = 4.663, p = 0.010. Smaller N200 amplitudes were observed on No-Go trials for those with higher PLEs, F(1,101) = 6.075, p = 0.020; no relationship was observed for internalizing or externalizing symptoms. Conclusions Long-term follow-up demonstrates for the first time a specific deficit in inhibitory control behaviorally and electrophysiology, for individuals who later report more PLEs. Decreases in task performance under frustration induction indicated risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that pathophysiological mechanisms for psychosis are relevant and discriminable in early childhood, and further, suggest an identifiable and potentially modifiable target for early intervention.

However, evidence for persistent alterations after weight-restoration has been surprisingly scarce despite high relapse rates, frequent transitions to other psychiatric disorders, and generally unfavorable outcome. While most studies investigated brain regions separately (univariate analysis), psychiatric disorders can be conceptualized as brain network disorders characterized by multivariate alterations with only subtle local effects. We tested for persistent multivariate structural brain alterations in weight-restored individuals with a history of AN, investigated their putative biological substrate and relation with 1-year treatment outcome. Methods We trained machine learning models on regional GM measures to classify healthy controls (HC) (N = 289) from individuals at three stages of AN: underweight patients starting intensive treatment (N = 165, used as baseline), patients after partial weight-restoration (N = 115), and former patients after stable and full weight-restoration (N = 89). Alterations after weight-restoration were related to treatment outcome and characterized both anatomically and functionally. Results Patients could be classified from HC when underweight (ROC-AUC = 0.90) but also after partial weight-restoration (ROC-AUC = 0.64). Alterations after partial weight-restoration were more pronounced in patients with worse outcome and were not detected in long-term weight-recovered individuals, i.e. those with favorable outcome. These alterations were more pronounced in regions with greater functional connectivity, not merely explained by body mass index, and even increases in cortical thickness were observed (insula, lateral orbitofrontal, temporal pole). Conclusions Analyzing persistent multivariate brain structural alterations after weight-restoration might help to develop personalized interventions after discharge from inpatient treatment.

This study examined efficacy moderators of combined treatment (STPP + antidepressants) v. antidepressants for adults with depression. Methods For this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017056029), we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase.com, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 1 January 2022. We included randomized clinical trials comparing combined treatment (antidepressants + individual outpatient STPP) v. antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of depression in adults. Individual participant data were requested and analyzed combinedly using mixed-effects models (adding Cochrane risk of bias items as covariates) and an exploratory machine learning technique. The primary outcome was post-treatment depression symptom level. Results Data were obtained for all seven trials identified (100%, n = 482, combined: n = 238, antidepressants: n = 244). Adding STPP to antidepressants was more efficacious for patients with high rather than low baseline depression levels [B = -0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.61 to -0.37, p < 0.0001] and for patients with a depressive episode duration of >2 years rather than <1 year (B = -0.68, 95% CI -1.31 to -0.05, p = 0.03) and than 1-2 years (B = -0.86, 95% CI -1.66 to -0.06, p = 0.04). Heterogeneity was low. Effects were replicated in analyses controlling for risk of bias. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study that examines moderators across trials assessing the addition of STPP to antidepressants. These findings need validation but suggest that depression severity and episode duration are factors to consider when adding STPP to antidepressants and might contribute to personalizing treatment selection for depression.

Methods We followed 1 516 392 individuals from the Swedish population born 1980-2000, from 1 July 2007, until 31 Dec 2017. We examined putative risk predictors with univariable and multivariable Cox Models and the potential causal effects of predictors by propensity score and co-sibling analyses. Result Of the individuals in our cohort, 24.8% (375 404) received a first OP, of whom 3034 (0.90%) developed a subsequent first OUD. The hazard ratio (HR) (± 95% CIs) for OUD after OP equaled 7.10 (6.75-7.46), with a mean time to onset of 3.41 (2.39) years. The strongest putative risk factors for development of OUD after OP were prior psychiatric and substance use disorders, criminal behavior, parental divorce/death, poor school performance, current community deprivation, divorce, and male sex. Few predictors differed across sexes. OP renewal was associated with a HR of 3.66 (3.41-3.93) for OUD. Co-sibling and propensity score analyses suggested that at least a moderate proportion of the risk factor-OUD association was likely causal. A risk score to predict OUD after OP had an AUC of 0.85, where nearly 60% of cases scoring in the top decile. Conclusions In a general population sample, an OP represents a substantial risk factor for subsequent OUD. Many of the risk factors for OUD after OP can be readily assessed at the time of potential OP, permitting clinicians to evaluate the risk of iatrogenic OUD. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

The relative contribution of these risk factors on child executive function (EF) has not been explored systematically. Methods A prospective pregnancy cohort of 197 women and their children was studied to determine whether maternal depression diagnosis and the trajectory of maternal depressive symptoms (MDSs) from early pregnancy to 12 months postpartum predicts child EF at age 4 (measured using the preschool age psychiatric assessment, NEPSY-II, and Shape School task) using latent growth curve modeling. Indirect effects of smoking, alcohol, and antidepressant use were also formally tested. Results Increasing maternal perinatal depressive symptoms over time predicted more inattentive symptoms, poorer switching, and motor inhibition, but not cognitive inhibition. When adjusted for multiple comparison, and after accounting for maternal cognition and education, the association with child inattentive symptoms remained significant. However, diagnosed depression did not predict child EF outcomes. Prenatal exposure to smoking, alcohol, and antidepressants also did not mediate pathways from depressive symptoms to EF outcomes. Our findings were limited by sample size and statistical power to detect outcome effects of smaller effect size. Conclusions This study suggests that increasing MDSs over the perinatal period is associated with poorer EF outcomes in children at age 4 - independent of prenatal smoking, drinking, or antidepressant use. Depressive chronicity, severity, and postpartum influences may play crucial roles in determining childhood outcomes of EF.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

However, sex and age variations in CUD and schizophrenia suggest the importance of examining differences in PARFs in sex and age subgroups. Methods We conducted a nationwide Danish register-based cohort study including all individuals aged 16-49 at some point during 1972-2021. CUD and schizophrenia status was obtained from the registers. Hazard ratios (HR), incidence risk ratios (IRR), and PARFs were estimated. Joinpoint analyses were applied to sex-specific PARFs. Results We examined 6 907 859 individuals with 45 327 cases of incident schizophrenia during follow-up across 129 521 260 person-years. The overall adjusted HR (aHR) for CUD on schizophrenia was slightly higher among males (aHR = 2.42, 95% CI 2.33-2.52) than females (aHR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.89-2.17); however, among 16-20-year-olds, the adjusted IRR (aIRR) for males was more than twice that for females (males: aIRR = 3.84, 95% CI 3.43-4.29; females: aIRR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.53-2.15). During 1972-2021, the annual average percentage change in PARFs for CUD in schizophrenia incidence was 4.8 among males (95% CI 4.3-5.3; p < 0.0001) and 3.2 among females (95% CI 2.5-3.8; p < 0.0001). In 2021, among males, PARF was 15%; among females, it was around 4%. Conclusions Young males might be particularly susceptible to the effects of cannabis on schizophrenia. At a population level, assuming causality, one-fifth of cases of schizophrenia among young males might be prevented by averting CUD.

While BED may be characterized by altered cortical morphometry, no evidence to date examined possible sex-differences in regional gray matter characteristics among those with BED. This is especially important to consider in children, where BED symptoms often emerge coincident with rapid gray matter maturation. Methods Pre-adolescent, 9-10-year old boys (N = 38) and girls (N = 33) with BED were extracted from the 3.0 baseline (Year 0) release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. We investigated sex differences in gray matter density (GMD) via voxel-based morphometry. Control sex differences were also assessed in age and body mass index and developmentally matched control children (boys N = 36; girls N = 38). Among children with BED, we additionally assessed the association between dorsolateral prefrontal (dlPFC) GMD and parent-reported behavioral approach and inhibition tendencies. Results Girls with BED uniquely demonstrate diffuse clusters of greater GMD (p < 0.05, Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement corrected) in the (i) left dlPFC (p = 0.003), (ii) bilateral dmPFC (p = 0.004), (iii) bilateral primary motor and somatosensory cortex (p = 0.0003) and (iv) bilateral precuneus (p = 0.007). Brain-behavioral associations suggest a unique negative correlation between GMD in the left dlPFC and behavioral approach tendencies among girls with BED. Conclusions Early-onset BED may be characterized by regional sex differences in terms of its underlying gray matter morphometry. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

New automated structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation tools facilitate the in vivo study of individual amygdala nuclei in clinical populations such as patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) who show symptoms indicative of limbic dysregulation. This study is the first to investigate amygdala nuclei volumes in AN, their relationships with leptin, a key indicator of AN-related neuroendocrine alterations, and further clinical measures. Methods T1-weighted MRI scans were subsegmented and multi-stage quality controlled using FreeSurfer. Left/right hemispheric amygdala nuclei volumes were cross-sectionally compared between females with AN (n = 168, 12-29 years) and age-matched healthy females (n = 168) applying general linear models. Associations with plasma leptin, body mass index (BMI), illness duration, and psychiatric symptoms were analyzed via robust linear regression. Results Globally, most amygdala nuclei volumes in both hemispheres were reduced in AN v. healthy control participants. Importantly, four specific nuclei (accessory basal, cortical, medial nuclei, corticoamygdaloid transition in the rostral-medial amygdala) showed greater volumetric reduction even relative to reductions of whole amygdala and total subcortical gray matter volumes, whereas basal, lateral, and paralaminar nuclei were less reduced. All rostral-medially clustered nuclei were positively associated with leptin in AN independent of BMI. Amygdala nuclei volumes were not associated with illness duration or psychiatric symptom severity in AN. Conclusions In AN, amygdala nuclei are altered to different degrees. Severe volume loss in rostral-medially clustered nuclei, collectively involved in olfactory/food-related reward processing, may represent a structural correlate of AN-related symptoms. Hypoleptinemia might be linked to rostral-medial amygdala alterations. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

It is important to identify which individuals are at greatest risk of worsening symptoms. This study aimed to examine changes in depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms using prospective and retrospective symptom change assessments, and to find and examine the effect of key risk factors. Method Online questionnaires were administered to 34 465 individuals (aged 16 years or above) in April/May 2020 in the UK, recruited from existing cohorts or via social media. Around one-third (n = 12 718) of included participants had prior diagnoses of depression or anxiety and had completed pre-pandemic mental health assessments (between September 2018 and February 2020), allowing prospective investigation of symptom change. Results Prospective symptom analyses showed small decreases in depression (PHQ-9: -0.43 points) and anxiety [generalised anxiety disorder scale - 7 items (GAD)-7: -0.33 points] and increases in PTSD (PCL-6: 0.22 points). Conversely, retrospective symptom analyses demonstrated significant large increases (PHQ-9: 2.40; GAD-7 = 1.97), with 55% reported worsening mental health since the beginning of the pandemic on a global change rating. Across both prospective and retrospective measures of symptom change, worsening depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms were associated with prior mental health diagnoses, female gender, young age and unemployed/student status. Conclusions We highlight the effect of prior mental health diagnoses on worsening mental health during the pandemic and confirm previously reported sociodemographic risk factors. Discrepancies between prospective and retrospective measures of changes in mental health may be related to recall bias-related underestimation of prior symptom severity.  © The Author(s), 2022.

Therefore, we performed an extensive network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the comparative effectiveness of psychotherapies for people diagnosed with PTSD. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in Cochrane library, Embase, Medline-OVID, PubMed, Scopus, and Psych-Info until March 2021. Studies on the effectiveness of cognitive processing therapy (CPT), cognitive therapy (CT), eye movement desensitisation reprocessing (EMDR), narrative exposure therapy (NET), prolonged exposure (PE), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), present-centred therapy (PCT), brief eclectic psychotherapies (BEP), psychodynamic therapy (PDT) or combination therapies compared to no treatment (NT) or treatment as usual (TAU) in adults with PTSD were included. Frequentist and Bayesian approaches were used for analysis in R-software. Results We included 98 RCTs with 5567 participants from 18 897 studies. CPT, EMDR, CT, NET, PE, CBT, and PCT were significant to reduce PTSD symptoms (SMD range: -1.53 to -0.75; Certainty: very low to high) at immediate post-treatment and ranked accordingly. Longitudinal analysis found EMDR (1.02) and CPT (0.85) as the significant therapies with large effect size in short-term and long-term follow-up, respectively. NET and CPT showed higher proportion of loss of PTSD diagnosis (RR range: 5.51-3.45) while there were no significant psychotherapies for retention rate compared to NT. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence for improving current guidelines and informing clinical decision-making for PTSD management. However, the best PTSD treatment plan should be tailored to patients' needs, characteristics, and clinician expertise. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020162143  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

This study evaluates the associations of polygenic risk scores (PRS) with patterns of posttraumatic stress symptoms following combat deployment. Method US Army soldiers of European ancestry (n = 4900) provided genomic data and ratings of posttraumatic stress symptoms before and after deployment to Afghanistan in 2012. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to model posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories among participants who provided post-deployment data (n = 4353). Multinomial logistic regression models tested independent associations between trajectory membership and PRS for PTSD, major depressive disorder (MDD), schizophrenia, neuroticism, alcohol use disorder, and suicide attempt, controlling for age, sex, ancestry, and exposure to potentially traumatic events, and weighted to account for uncertainty in trajectory classification and missing data. Results Participants were classified into low-severity (77.2%), increasing-severity (10.5%), decreasing-severity (8.0%), and high-severity (4.3%) posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories. Standardized PTSD-PRS and MDD-PRS were associated with greater odds of membership in the high-severity v. low-severity trajectory [adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, 1.23 (1.06-1.43) and 1.18 (1.02-1.37), respectively] and the increasing-severity v. low-severity trajectory [1.12 (1.01-1.25) and 1.16 (1.04-1.28), respectively]. Additionally, MDD-PRS was associated with greater odds of membership in the decreasing-severity v. low-severity trajectory [1.16 (1.03-1.31)]. No other associations were statistically significant. Conclusions Higher polygenic risk for PTSD or MDD is associated with more severe posttraumatic stress symptom trajectories following combat deployment. PRS may help stratify at-risk individuals, enabling more precise targeting of treatment and prevention programs.  © U.S. Department of Defense and the Author(s), 2023.

Genetic studies provided some evidence of a causal effect of smoking on SCZ. We aim to characterize the genetic susceptibility to SCZ affected by genetic susceptibility to smoking. Methods Multi-trait-based conditional and joint analysis was applied to the largest European SCZ genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to remove genetic effects on SCZ driven by smoking, estimated by generalized summary data-based Mendelian randomization. Enrichment analysis was performed to compare original v. conditional GWAS. Change in genetic correlation between SCZ and relevant traits after conditioning was assessed. Colocalization analysis was performed to identify specific loci confirming general findings. Results Conditional analysis identified 19 new risk loci for SCZ and 42 lost loci whose association with SCZ may be partially driven by smoking. These results were strengthened by colocalization analysis. Enrichment analysis indicated a higher association of differentially expressed genes at prenatal brain stages after conditioning. Genetic correlation of SCZ with substance use and dependence, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and several externalizing traits significantly changed after conditioning. Colocalization of association signal between SCZ and these traits was identified for some of the lost loci, such as CHRNA2, CUL3, and PCDH7. Conclusions Our approach led to identification of potential new SCZ loci, loci partially associated to SCZ through smoking, and a shared genetic susceptibility between SCZ and smoking behavior related to externalizing phenotypes. Application of this approach to other psychiatric disorders and substances may lead to a better understanding of the role of substances on mental health.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

However, little is known about potential mediators that could explain these sex differences. Methods Our sample consisted of 137 individuals with first episode schizophrenia (males, n = 105; 77%) with a mean age of 22.1(s.d. = 4.1) years and mean education of 12.5(s.d. = 1.7) years. At entry, patients were within 2 years of their first psychotic episode onset. Baseline assessments were conducted for premorbid adjustment, symptoms, cognitive functioning, insight, and at 6-months for role and social functioning. Results Males as compared to females had poorer premorbid adjustment across several key developmental periods (p < 0.01), an earlier age of onset [M = 20.3(3.3) v. 22.8(5.6), p = 0.002], more negative symptoms (p = 0.044), poorer insight (p = 0.031), and poorer baseline and 6-month role (p = 0.002) and social functioning (p = 0.034). Several of these variables in which males showed impairment were significant predictors of 6-month role and social functioning. Premorbid adjustment and insight mediated the relationship between sex and role and social functioning at 6-months, but not negative symptoms. Discussion Males compared to females were at lower levels across several key premorbid and clinical domains which are strongly associated with functional outcome supporting the hypothesis that males might have a more disabling form of schizophrenia. The relationship between sex with role and social functioning was mediated through premorbid adjustment and insight suggesting pathways for understanding why females might have a less disabling form of schizophrenia.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Relatively few studies have explored the differential contributions of the accumulative dosage of psychotropic medications on mortality in patients with schizophrenia. Methods. We aimed to explore the effects of the exposure dosage of psychotropic medications on mortality during a follow-up period of 5 years with a national cohort of individuals with schizophrenia in 2010. Causes of death were linked through Taiwan’s National Mortality Registry. The mean defined daily dose of antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and sedative-hypnotics, were calculated and survival analyses were conducted. Results. A total of 102 964 individuals (54 151 men, 52.59%) with schizophrenia were included. Compared to patients with no exposure to antipsychotics, those with antipsychotic exposure had better survival outcomes, regardless of antipsychotic dosage. Antidepressant exposure, in low and moderate dosage, was associated with decreased all-cause mortality; exposure to mood stabilizers appeared to be associated with an increase in all-cause mortality. Although 89.7% of the patients had been prescribed sedative-hypnotics, exposure to sedative-hypnotics was associated with dose-related increased mortality risk [hazard ratio (HR) in low dose group: 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07–1.27; HR in moderate dose: 1.32, 95% CI 1.21–1.44; HR in high dose: 1.83, 95% CI 1.67–2.01)]. Conclusions. The results indicate that in the treatment of schizophrenia, antipsychotics and antidepressants are associated with lower mortality when using adequate dosages and mood stabilizers and sedative-hypnotics with higher mortality compared with no use. Furthermore, exposure to sedative-hypnotics is associated with a dose-related increased mortality risk which warrants clinical attention and further study. © The Author(s), 2022.

While adult outcome in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is generally measured using socially valued roles, it could also be understood in terms of aspects related to health status – an approach that could inform on potential gender differences. Methods. We investigated gender differences in two aspects of outcome related to health-status, i.e. general functioning and self-perceived health status, and co-occurring health conditions in a large multi-center sample of autistic adults. Three hundred and eighty-three participants were consecutively recruited from the FondaMental Advanced Centers of Expertise for ASD cohort (a French network of seven expert centers) between 2013 and 2020. Evaluation included a medical interview, standardized scales for autism diagnosis, clinical and functional outcomes, self-perceived health status and verbal ability. Psychosocial function was measured using the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. Results. While autistic women in this study were more likely than men to have socially valued roles, female gender was associated with poorer physical and mental health (e.g. a 7-fold risk for having three or more co-occurring physical health conditions) and a poorer self-perceived health status. Psychosocial function was negatively associated with depression and impairment in social communication. Half of the sample had multiple co-occurring health conditions but more than 70% reported that their visit at the Expert Center was their first contact with mental health services. Conclusions.

The neurobiological pathogenesis of major depression disorder (MDD) remains largely controversial. Previous literatures with limited sample size utilizing group-level structural covariance networks (SCN) commonly generated mixed findings regarding the topology of brain networks. Methods. We analyzed T1 images from a high-powered multisite sample including 1173 patients with MDD and 1019 healthy controls (HCs). We used regional gray matter volume to construct individual SCN by utilizing a novel approach based on the interregional effect size difference. We further investigated MDD-related structural connectivity alterations using topological metrics. Results. Compared to HCs, the MDD patients showed a shift toward randomization characterized by increased integration. Further subgroup analysis of patients in different stages revealed this randomization pattern was also observed in patients with recurrent MDD, while the first-episode drug naïve patients exhibited decreased segregation. Altered nodal properties in several brain regions which have a key role in both emotion regulation and executive control were also found in MDD patients compared with HCs. The abnormalities in inferior temporal gyrus were not influenced by any specific site. Moreover, antidepressants increased nodal efficiency in the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions. The MDD patients at different stages exhibit distinct patterns of randomization in their brain networks, with increased integration during illness progression. These findings provide valuable insights into the disruption in structural brain networks that occurs in patients with MDD and might be useful to guide future therapeutic interventions. © The Author(s), 2023.

Alcohol binge drinking may compromise the functioning of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), i.e. the neural hub for processing reward and aversive responses. Methods. As socially stressful events pose particular challenges at developmental stages, this research applied the resident–intruder paradigm as a model of social stress, to highlight behavioural neuroendocrine and molecular maladaptive plasticity in rats at withdrawal from binge-like alcohol exposure in adolescence. In search of a rescue agent, cannabidiol (CBD) was selected due to its favourable effects on alcohol- and stress-related harms. Results. Binge-like alcohol exposed intruder rats displayed a compromised defensive behaviour against the resident and a blunted response of the stress system, in addition to indexes of abnormal dopamine (DA)/glutamate plasticity and dysfunctional spine dynamics in the NAc. CBD administration (60 mg/kg) was able to: (1) increase social exploration in the binge-like alcohol exposed intruder rats, at the expenses of freezing time, and in control rats, which received less aggressive attacks from the resident; (2) reduce corticosterone levels independently on alcohol previous exposure; (3) restore DA transmission and (4) facilitate excitatory postsynaptic strength and remodelling. Conclusions. Overall, the maladaptive behavioural and synaptic plasticity promoted by the intersection between binge-like alcohol withdrawal and exposure to adverse social stress can be rescued by a CBD détente effect that results in a successful defensive strategy, supported by a functional endocrine and synaptic plasticity. The current data highlight CBD’s relevant therapeutic potential in alcohol- and stress-related harms, and prompt further investigation on its molecular targets. © The Author(s), 2022.

Whilst AN genetic studies could identify novel treatment targets, integration of functional genomics data, including transcriptomics and proteomics, would assist to disentangle correlated signals and reveal causally associated genes. Methods We used models of genetically imputed expression and splicing from 14 tissues, leveraging mRNA, protein, and mRNA alternative splicing weights to identify genes, proteins, and transcripts, respectively, associated with AN risk. This was accomplished through transcriptome, proteome, and spliceosome-wide association studies, followed by conditional analysis and finemapping to prioritise candidate causal genes. Results We uncovered 134 genes for which genetically predicted mRNA expression was associated with AN after multiple-testing correction, as well as four proteins and 16 alternatively spliced transcripts. Conditional analysis of these significantly associated genes on other proximal association signals resulted in 97 genes independently associated with AN. Moreover, probabilistic finemapping further refined these associations and prioritised putative causal genes. The gene WDR6, for which increased genetically predicted mRNA expression was correlated with AN, was strongly supported by both conditional analyses and finemapping. Pathway analysis of genes revealed by finemapping identified the pathway regulation of immune system process (overlapping genes = MST1, TREX1, PRKAR2A, PROS1) as statistically overrepresented. Conclusions We leveraged multiomic datasets to genetically prioritise novel risk genes for AN. Multiple-lines of evidence support that WDR6 is associated with AN, whilst other prioritised genes were enriched within immune related pathways, further supporting the role of the immune system in AN.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Research on biased processing of aversive stimuli in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has produced inconsistent results between response time (RT) and eye-tracking studies. Recent RT-based results of dot-probe studies showed no attentional bias (AB) for threat while eye-tracking research suggested heightened sustained attention for this information. Here, we used both RT-based and eye-tracking measures to explore the dynamics of AB to negative stimuli in PTSD. Methods. Twenty-three individuals diagnosed with PTSD, 23 trauma-exposed healthy controls, and 23 healthy controls performed an emotional dot-probe task with pairs of negative and neutral scenes presented for either 1 or 2 s. Analyses included eye movements during the presentation of the scenes and RT associated with target localization. Results. There was no evidence for an AB toward negative stimuli in PTSD from RT measures. However, the main eye-tracking results revealed that all three groups showed longer dwell times on negative pictures than neutral pictures at 1 s and that this AB was stronger for individuals with PTSD. Moreover, although AB disappeared for the two groups of healthy controls with prolonged exposure, it persisted for individuals with PTSD. Conclusion. PTSD is associated with an AB toward negative stimuli, characterized by heightened sustained attention toward negative scenes once detected. This study sheds light on the dynamics of AB to negative stimuli in PTSD and encourages us to consider optimized therapeutic interventions targeting abnormal AB patterns. © The Author(s), 2022.

Resilience is defined as the ability to modify thoughts to cope with stressful events. Patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) having higher resilience (HR) levels show less severe symptoms and better real-life functioning. However, the clinical factors contributing to determine resilience levels in patients remain unclear. Thus, based on psychological, historical, clinical and environmental variables, we built a supervised machine learning algorithm to classify patients with HR or lower resilience (LR). Methods. SCZ from the Italian Network for Research on Psychoses (N = 598 in the Discovery sample, N = 298 in the Validation sample) underwent historical, clinical, psychological, environmental and resilience assessments. A Support Vector Machine algorithm (based on 85 variables extracted from the above-mentioned assessments) was built in the Discovery sample, and replicated in the Validation sample, to classify between HR and LR patients, within a nested, Leave-Site-Out Cross-Validation framework. We then investigated whether algorithm decision scores were associated with the cognitive and clinical characteristics of patients. Results. The algorithm classified patients as HR or LR with a Balanced Accuracy of 74.5% (p < 0.0001) in the Discovery sample, and 80.2% in the Validation sample. Higher self-esteem, larger social network and use of adaptive coping strategies were the variables most frequently chosen by the algorithm to generate decisions. Correlations between algorithm decision scores, socio-cognitive abilities, and symptom severity were significant (pFDR < 0.05). Conclusions. We identified an accurate, meaningful and generalizable clinical-psychological signature associated with resilience in SCZ. This study delivers relevant information regarding psychological and clinical factors that non-pharmacological interventions could target in schizophrenia. © The Author(s), 2022.

Theory and research highlight the impact of maternal invalidation on child aggression and suggest that its influence may vary based on differences in child physiological reactivity. Moreover, the interaction between these risk factors may be particularly pronounced among children of mothers with emotion regulation (ER) difficulties. The current study examined the independent and interactive effects of maternal invalidation and child physiological reactivity to frustration on teacher-reported aggression in an at-risk sample of preschool children. Method Participants included 77 mothers (Mage = 33.17 years, s.d. = 4.83; 35% racial/ethnic minority) and their children (Mage = 42.48 months; s.d. = 3.78; 56% female; 47% racial/ethnic minority). Groups of mothers with and without clinician-rated ER difficulties reported on maternal invalidation, and child respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was assessed continuously during a frustration task as an indicator of physiological reactivity. Teachers or daycare providers reported on child aggression. Results Results demonstrated positive associations between maternal ER difficulties and both maternal invalidation and child RSA reactivity to frustration. As expected, the interaction between maternal invalidation and child RSA reactivity was significant, such that higher maternal invalidation and greater child RSA reactivity to frustration predicted more aggression in a daycare or preschool setting. Importantly, this effect was demonstrated while controlling for demographic covariates and baseline RSA. Conclusions Findings are in line with diathesis-stress and biosocial models of risk and point to multiple targets for prevention and early intervention. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Preschool psychiatric symptoms significantly increase the risk for long-term negative outcomes. Transdiagnostic hierarchical approaches that capture general (‘p’) and specific psychopathology dimensions are promising for understanding risk and predicting outcomes, but their predictive utility in young children is not well established. We delineated a hierarchical structure of preschool psychopathology dimensions and tested their ability to predict psychiatric disorders and functional impairment in preadolescence. Methods. Data for 1253 preschool children (mean age = 4.17, S.D. = 0.81) were drawn from three longitudinal studies using a similar methodology (one community sample, two psychopathology-enriched samples) and followed up into preadolescence, yielding a large and diverse sample. Exploratory factor models derived a hierarchical structure of general and specific factors using symptoms from the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment interview. Longitudinal analyses examined the prospective associations of preschool p and specific factors with preadolescent psychiatric disorders and functional impairment. Results. A hierarchical dimensional structure with a p factor at the top and up to six specific factors (distress, fear, separation anxiety, social anxiety, inattention-hyperactivity, oppositionality) emerged at preschool age. The p factor predicted all preadolescent disorders (ΔR2 = 0.04–0.15) and functional impairment (ΔR2 = 0.01–0.07) to a significantly greater extent than preschool psychiatric diagnoses and functioning. Specific dimensions provided additional predictive power for the majority of preadolescent outcomes (disorders: ΔR2 = 0.06–0.15; functional impairment: ΔR2 = 0.05–0.12). Conclusions. Both general and specific dimensions of preschool psychopathology are useful for predicting clinical and functional outcomes almost a decade later. These findings highlight the value of transdiagnostic dimensions for predicting prognosis and as potential targets for early intervention and prevention. © The Author(s), 2022.

Relatively little is known about the timing of when during a course of care the treatment response becomes apparent. Novel machine learning methods, especially continuously updating prediction models, have the potential to address these gaps in our understanding of response and optimize PTSD treatment. Methods Using data from a 3-week (n = 362) CPT-based intensive PTSD treatment program (ITP), we explored three methods for generating continuously updating prediction models to predict endpoint PTSD severity. These included Mixed Effects Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (MixedBART), Mixed Effects Random Forest (MERF) machine learning models, and Linear Mixed Effects models (LMM). Models used baseline and self-reported PTSD symptom severity data collected every other day during treatment. We then validated our findings by examining model performances in a separate, equally established, 2-week CPT-based ITP (n = 108). Results Results across approaches were very similar and indicated modest prediction accuracy at baseline (R2 ~ 0.18), with increasing accuracy of predictions of final PTSD severity across program timepoints (e.g. mid-program R2 ~ 0.62). Similar findings were obtained when the models were applied to the 2-week ITP. Neither the MERF nor the MixedBART machine learning approach outperformed LMM prediction, though benefits of each may differ based on the application. Conclusions Utilizing continuously updating models in PTSD treatments may be beneficial for clinicians in determining whether an individual is responding, and when this determination can be made. © The Author(s), 2022.

Despite its introduction into the diagnostic nomenclature over four decades ago, there remain large knowledge gaps about disordered gambling. The primary aims of the present study were to document the long-term course, childhood precursors, and adult life outcomes associated with disordered gambling. Methods. Participants enrolled in the population-representative Dunedin Study were prospectively followed from birth through age 45. Disordered gambling was assessed six times from age 18; composite measures of childhood social class, general intelligence, and low self-control were based on assessments obtained from birth through age 15; adult socioeconomic, financial, and legal outcomes were obtained through age 45. Lifetime disordered gambling was predicted from the three childhood precursors and the adult outcomes were predicted from lifetime disordered gambling. Results. Past-year disordered gambling usually occurred at only a single time point and recurrence was relatively uncommon. Lower childhood social class, general intelligence, and self-control significantly predicted lifetime disordered gambling in adulthood. In turn, lifetime disordered gambling in adulthood significantly predicted occupational, educational, and financial problems in adulthood (ds = 0.23–0.41). These associations were markedly reduced and sometimes rendered nonsignificant after adjusting for childhood precursors (ds = 0.04–0.32). Conclusions. Socioeconomic, financial, and legal outcomes in adulthood are not merely consequences of disordered gambling, but also are predicted from childhood precursors. Deflecting the trajectories of young people at risk for developing disordered gambling may help to ameliorate not just the development of later disordered gambling, but also other associated adverse outcomes. © The Author(s), 2022.

However, high-interindividual heterogeneity hinders the identification of shared and distinct patterns of brain network abnormalities across mental disorders. This study aimed to identify shared and distinct patterns of altered structural covariance across mental disorders. Methods Subject-level structural covariance aberrance in patients with mental disorders was investigated using individualized differential structural covariance network. This method inferred structural covariance aberrance at the individual level by measuring the degree of structural covariance in patients deviating from matched healthy controls (HCs). T1-weighted anatomical images of 513 participants (105, 98, 190 participants with depression, OCD and schizophrenia, respectively, and 130 age- and sex-matched HCs) were acquired and analyzed. Results Patients with mental disorders exhibited notable heterogeneity in terms of altered edges, which were otherwise obscured by group-level analysis. The three disorders shared high difference variability in edges attached to the frontal network and the subcortical-cerebellum network, and they also exhibited disease-specific variability distributions. Despite notable variability, patients with the same disorder shared disease-specific groups of altered edges. Specifically, depression was characterized by altered edges attached to the subcortical-cerebellum network; OCD, by altered edges linking the subcortical-cerebellum and motor networks; and schizophrenia, by altered edges related to the frontal network. Conclusions These results have potential implications for understanding heterogeneity and facilitating personalized diagnosis and interventions for mental disorders.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Despite increasing knowledge on the neuroimaging patterns of eating disorder (ED) symptoms in non-clinical populations, studies using whole-brain machine learning to identify connectome-based neuromarkers of ED symptomatology are absent. This study examined the association of connectivity within and between large-scale functional networks with specific symptomatic behaviors and cognitions using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). Methods. CPM with ten-fold cross-validation was carried out to probe functional networks that were predictive of ED-associated symptomatology, including body image concerns, binge eating, and compensatory behaviors, within the discovery sample of 660 participants. The predictive ability of the identified networks was validated using an independent sample of 821 participants. Results. The connectivity predictive of body image concerns was identified within and between networks implicated in cognitive control (frontoparietal and medial frontal), reward sensitivity (subcortical), and visual perception (visual). Crucially, the set of connections in the positive network related to body image concerns identified in one sample was generalized to predict body image concerns in an independent sample, suggesting the replicability of this effect. Conclusions. These findings point to the feasibility of using the functional connectome to predict ED symptomatology in the general population and provide the first evidence that functional interplay among distributed networks predicts body shape/weight concerns. © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods In total, 10 368 mothers in Nurses' Health Study II and 13 478 offspring in the Growing Up Today Study were paired. Maternal and offspring healthy lifestyles were defined as a composite score including a healthy diet, normal body mass index (BMI), never-smoking, light-to-moderate consumption of alcohol, and regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Maternal lifestyles were assessed during their offspring's childhood. Offspring depressive symptoms were repeatedly assessed five times using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale-10 (CESD-10); the offspring were between the ages of 14 and 30 when the first CESD-10 was assessed. Covariates included maternal variables (age at baseline, race/ethnicity, antidepressant use, pregnancy complications, etc.) and offspring age and sex. Results Children of mothers with the healthiest lifestyle had significantly fewer depressive symptoms (a 0.30 lower CESD-10 score, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.50) in comparison with children of mothers with the least healthy lifestyle. The association was only found significant in female offspring but not in males. For individual maternal lifestyle factors, a normal BMI, never-smoking, and adherence to regular physical activity were independently associated with fewer depressive symptoms among the offspring. The association between maternal healthy lifestyles and offspring depressive symptoms was mediated by offspring's healthy lifestyles (mediation effect: 53.2%, 95% CI 15.8-87.3). Conclusions Our finding indicates the potential mechanism of intergenerational transmission of healthy lifestyles to reduce the risk of depressive symptoms in offspring.

As the need for mental health support is becoming increasingly prevalent in students, identification of factors associated with poorer outcomes is a priority. Changes in social functioning have a bi-directional relationship with mental health, however it is not clear how such measures may be related to effectiveness of psychological treatments. Methods Growth mixture models were estimated on a sample of 5221 students treated in routine mental health services to identify different trajectories of change in self-rated impairment in social leisure activities and close relationships during the course of treatment. Multinomial regression explored associations between trajectory classes and treatment outcomes. Results Five trajectory classes were identified for social leisure activity impairment while three classes were identified for close relationship impairment. In both measures most students remained mildly impaired. Other trajectories included severe impairment with limited improvement, severe impairment with delayed improvement, and, in social leisure activities only, rapid improvement, and deterioration. Trajectories of improvement were associated with positive treatment outcomes while trajectories of worsening or stable severe impairment were associated with negative treatment outcomes. Conclusions Changes in social functioning impairment are associated with psychological treatment outcomes in students, suggesting that these changes may be associated with treatment effectiveness as well as recovery experiences. Future research should seek to establish whether a causal link exists to understand whether integrating social support within psychological treatment may bring additional benefit for students.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

This study used a quasi-experimental design to account for potential confounding by sociodemographic characteristics. Methods Data were drawn from 16 prenatal cohorts participating in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program. Women exposed to the pandemic (delivered between 12 March 2020 and 30 May 2021) (n = 501) were propensity-score matched on maternal age, race and ethnicity, and child assigned sex at birth with 501 women who delivered before 11 March 2020. Participants reported on perceived stress, depressive symptoms, sedentary behavior, and emotional support during pregnancy. Infant gestational age (GA) at birth and birthweight were gathered from medical record abstraction or maternal report. Results After adjusting for propensity matching and covariates (maternal education, public assistance, employment status, prepregnancy body mass index), results showed a small effect of pandemic exposure on shorter GA at birth, but no effect on birthweight adjusted for GA. Women who were pregnant during the pandemic reported higher levels of prenatal stress and depressive symptoms, but neither mediated the association between pandemic exposure and GA. Sedentary behavior and emotional support were each associated with prenatal stress and depressive symptoms in opposite directions, but no moderation effects were revealed. Conclusions There was no strong evidence for an association between pandemic exposure and adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, results highlight the importance of reducing maternal sedentary behavior and encouraging emotional support for optimizing maternal health regardless of pandemic conditions.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

The present study was designed to (1) estimate NSSI persistence during the college period, (2) identify risk factors and high-risk students for NSSI persistence patterns, and (3) evaluate the association with future mental disorders and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB). Methods Using prospective cohorts from the Leuven College Surveys (n = 5915), part of the World Mental Health International College Student Initiative, web-based surveys assessed mental health and psychosocial problems at college entrance and three annual follow-up assessments. Results Approximately one in five (20.4%) students reported lifetime NSSI at college entrance. NSSI persistence was estimated at 56.4%, with 15.6% reporting a high-frequency repetitive pattern (≥five times yearly). Many hypothesized risk factors were associated with repetitive NSSI persistence, with the most potent effects observed for pre-college NSSI characteristics. Multivariate models suggest that an intervention focusing on the 10-20% at the highest predicted risk could effectively reach 34.9-56.7% of students with high-frequency repetitive NSSI persistence (PPV = 81.8-93.4, AUC = 0.88-0.91). Repetitive NSSI persistence during the first two college years predicted 12-month mental disorders, role impairment, and STB during the third college year, including suicide attempts. Conclusions Most emerging adults with a history of NSSI report persistent self-injury during their college years. Web-based screening may be a promising approach for detecting students at risk for a highly persistent NSSI pattern characterized by subsequent adverse outcomes. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Furthermore, timing of maternal stressors has rarely been examined. Here, we examined how maternal stressors occurring during adolescence, pregnancy, and across the lifespan related to child TL in Black and White mothers. Method Mothers (112 Black; 110 White; Mage = 39) and their youngest offspring (n = 222; Mage = 8) were part of a larger prospective cohort study, wherein mothers reported their stressors during adolescence (assessed twice during adolescence for the past year), pregnancy (assessed in midlife for most recent pregnancy), and across their lifespan (assessed in midlife). Mother and child provided saliva for TL measurement. Multiple linear regression models examined the interaction of maternal stressor exposure and race in relation to child TL, controlling for maternal TL and child gender and age. Race-stratified analyses were also conducted. Results Neither maternal adolescence nor lifespan stressors interacted with race in relation to child TL. In contrast, greater maternal pregnancy stressors were associated with shorter child TL, but this effect was present for children of White but not Black mothers. Moreover, this effect was significant for financial but not social pregnancy stressors. Race-stratified models revealed that greater financial pregnancy stressors predicted shorter telomeres in offspring of White, but not Black mothers. Conclusions Race and maternal stressors interact and are related to biological aging across generations, but these effects are specific to certain races, stressors, and exposure time periods.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the growing human mental health challenges facing the global health care system. In this study, the structural connectivity between symptoms of MDD is explored using two different network modeling approaches. Methods. Data are from ‘the Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders (VATSPSUD)’. A cohort of N = 2163 American Caucasian female-female twins was assessed as part of the VATSPSUD study. MDD symptoms were assessed using personal structured clinical interviews. Two network analyses were conducted. First, an undirected network model was estimated to explore the connectivity between the MDD symptoms. Then, using a Bayesian network, we computed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to investigate possible directional relationships between symptoms. Results. Based on the results of the undirected network, the depressed mood symptom had the highest centrality value, indicating its importance in the overall network of MDD symptoms. Bayesian network analysis indicated that depressed mood emerged as a plausible driving symptom for activating other symptoms. These results are consistent with DSM-5 guidelines for MDD. Also, somatic weight and appetite symptoms appeared as the strongest connections in both networks. Conclusions. We discuss how the findings of our study might help future research to detect clinically relevant symptoms and possible directional relationships between MDD symptoms defining major depression episodes, which would help identify potential tailored interventions. This is the first study to investigate the network structure of VATSPSUD data using both undirected and directed network models. © The Author(s), 2022.

Metrics based on remission status and on single end-point (SEP) assessment may be problematic given infrequent symptom remission, temporal instability, and poor durability of benefit in DTD. Methods Self-report and clinician assessment of depression symptom severity were regularly obtained over a 2-year period in a chronic and highly treatment-resistant registry sample (N = 406) receiving treatment as usual, with or without vagus nerve stimulation. Twenty alternative metrics for characterizing symptomatic improvement were evaluated, contrasting SEP metrics with integrative (INT) metrics that aggregated information over time. Metrics were compared in effect size and discriminating power when contrasting groups that did (N = 153) and did not (N = 253) achieve a threshold level of improvement in end-point quality-of-life (QoL) scores, and in their association with continuous QoL scores. Results Metrics based on remission status had smaller effect size and poorer discrimination of the binary QoL outcome and weaker associations with the continuous end-point QoL scores than metrics based on partial response or response. The metrics with the strongest performance characteristics were the SEP measure of percentage change in symptom severity and the INT metric quantifying the proportion of the observation period in partial response or better. Both metrics contributed independent variance when predicting end-point QoL scores. Conclusions Revision is needed in the metrics used to quantify symptomatic change in DTD with consideration of INT time-based measures as primary or secondary outcomes. Metrics based on remission status may not be useful. © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Studies have shown that people with internet gaming disorder (IGD) exhibit impaired executive control of gaming cravings; however, the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain unknown. In addition, these conclusions were based on the hypothesis that brain networks are temporally static, neglecting dynamic changes in cognitive processes. Methods. Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 402 subjects [162 subjects with IGD and 240 recreational game users (RGUs)]. The community structure (recruitment and integration) of the executive control network (ECN) and the basal ganglia network (BGN), which represents the reward network, of patients with IGD and RGUs were compared. Mediation effects among the different networks were analyzed. Results. Compared to RGUs, subjects with IGD had a lower recruitment coefficient within the right ECN. Further analysis showed that only male subjects had a lower recruitment coefficient. Mediation analysis showed that the integration coefficient of the right ECN mediated the relationship between the recruitment coefficients of both the right ECN and the BGN in RGUs. Conclusions. Male subjects with IGD had a lower recruitment coefficient than RGUs, which impairing their impulse control. The mediation results suggest that top-down executive control of the ECN is absent in subjects with IGD. Together, these findings could explain why subjects with IGD exhibit impaired executive control of gaming cravings; these results have important therapeutic implications for developing effective interventions for IGD. © The Author(s), 2022.

We aimed to examine suicide risk in Denmark with both individual and neighbourhood level risk factors. Methods We used Danish register-based data to identify individuals born in Denmark from 1972, with full parental information and psychiatric diagnosis history. We fitted a two-level survival model to estimate individual and neighbourhood determinants on suicide risk. Results We identified 1723 cases of suicide in Denmark during the follow-up period from 1982 to 2015. Suicide risk was explained mainly by individual determinants. Parental comorbidities, particularly maternal schizophrenia [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 2.29, 95% CI 1.56-3.16] and paternal death (2.29, 95% CI 1.31-3.72) partly explained suicide risk when adjusted for all other determinants. The general contextual effect of suicide risk across neighbourhoods showed a median incidence rate ratio (MRR) of 1.13 (1.01-1.28), which was further reduced with full adjustment. Suicide risk increased in neighbourhoods with a higher proportion of manual workers (IRR: 1.08; 1.03-1.14), and decreased with a higher population density (IRR: 0.89; 0.83-0.96). Conclusion Suicide risk varies mainly between individuals, with parental comorbidities having the largest effect on suicide risk. Suicide risk was less impacted by neighbourhood, though, albeit to a lesser extent than individual determinants, some characteristics were associated with suicide risk. Suicide prevention policies might consider targeting interventions towards individuals more vulnerable due to particular parental comorbidities, whilst taking into account that some neighbourhood characteristics might exacerbate this risk further.

We examined the responses to aversive Pavlovian conditioning with an unpredictable spatial context as conditioned stimulus compared to a predictable context. We hypothesized that the PTSD group would demonstrate less hippocampal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation during acquisition and extinction of unpredictable contexts and an over-reactive amygdala response in the predictable contexts compared to controls. Methods A novel combined differential cue-context conditioning paradigm was applied using virtual reality with spatial contexts that required configural and cue processing. We assessed 20 patients with PTSD, 21 healthy trauma-exposed (TC) and 22 non-trauma-exposed (HC) participants using functional magnetic resonance imaging, skin conductance responses, and self-report measures. Results During fear acquisition, patients with PTSD compared to TC showed lower activity in the hippocampi in the unpredictable and higher activity in the amygdalae in the predictable context. During fear extinction, TC compared to patients and HC showed higher brain activity in the vmPFC in the predictable context. There were no significant differences in self-report or skin conductance responses. Conclusions Our results suggest that patients with PTSD differ in brain activation from controls in regions such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the vmPFC in the processing of unpredictable and predictable contexts. Deficient encoding of more complex configurations might lead to a preponderance of cue-based predictions in PTSD. Exposure-based treatments need to focus on improving predictability of contextual processing and reducing enhanced cue reactivity. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic mechanisms of CBF abnormalities in MDD. Methods To achieve a more thorough characterization of CBF changes in MDD, we performed a comprehensive neuroimaging meta-analysis of previous literature as well as examined group CBF differences in an independent sample of 133 MDD patients and 133 controls. In combination with the Allen Human Brain Atlas, transcriptome-neuroimaging spatial association analyses were conducted to identify genes whose expression correlated with CBF changes in MDD, followed by a set of gene functional feature analyses. Results We found increased CBF in the reward circuitry and default-mode network and decreased CBF in the visual system in MDD patients. Moreover, these CBF changes were spatially associated with expression of 1532 genes, which were enriched for important molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components of the cerebral cortex as well as several common mental disorders. Concurrently, these genes were specifically expressed in the brain tissue, in immune cells and neurons, and during nearly all developmental stages. Regarding behavioral relevance, these genes were associated with domains involving emotion and sensation. In addition, these genes could construct a protein-protein interaction network supported by 60 putative hub genes with functional significance. Conclusions Our findings suggest a cerebral perfusion redistribution in MDD, which may be a consequence of complex interactions of a wide range of genes with diverse functional features. © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Schema modes are combinations of self-reflective evaluations, negative emotional states, and destructive coping strategies common in BPD. When activated, they can push patients with BPD into emotional turmoil and a dissociative state of mind. Our knowledge of the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms driving these changes is incomplete. We hypothesized that in patients with BPD, affective instability is more influenced by reward expectation, outcomes, and reward prediction errors (RPEs) during risky decision-making than in healthy controls. Additionally, we expected that these alterations would be related to schema modes. Methods Thirty-two patients with BPD and thirty-one healthy controls were recruited. We used an established behavioral paradigm to measure mood fluctuations during risky decision-making. The impact of expectations and RPEs on momentary mood was quantified by a computational model, and its parameters were estimated with hierarchical Bayesian analysis. Model parameters were compared using High-Density Intervals. Results We found that model parameters capturing the influence of RPE and Certain Rewards on mood were significantly higher in patients with BPD than in controls. These model parameters correlated significantly with schema modes, but not with depression severity. Conclusions BPD is coupled with altered associations between mood fluctuation and reward processing under uncertainty. Our findings seem to be BPD-specific, as they stand in contrast with the correlates of depressive symptoms. Future studies should establish the clinical utility of these alterations, such as predicting or assessing therapeutic response in BPD.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

This experimental study employed facial electromyography (left zygomaticus major and left corrugator supercilia) in a sample of CHR individuals (N = 34) and healthy controls (N = 32) to detect alterations in facial expressions in response to emotionally evocative film clips and to determine links with symptoms. Results. Findings revealed that the CHR group showed facial blunting manifested in reduced zygomatic activity in response to an excitement (but not amusement, fear, or sadness) film clip compared to controls. Reductions in zygomatic activity in the CHR group emerged in response to the emotionally evocative peak period of the excitement film clip. Lower zygomaticus activity during the excitement clip was related to anxiety while lower rates of change in zygomatic activity during the excitement video clip were related to higher psychosis risk conversion scores. Conclusions. Together, these findings inform vulnerability/disease driving mechanisms and biomarker and treatment development. © The Author(s), 2022.

To explore the cross-sectional and longitudinal association between vitamin D and depressive symptoms across early adolescence. Methods. This longitudinal study included 1607 early adolescents [mean (S.D.) age, 12.49 years; 972 (60.5%) males] from the Chinese Early Adolescents Cohort, recruited from a middle school in Anhui Province and followed up annually (2019–2021). Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured in both 2019 and 2021. Self-reports on depression were assessed at each of three time points from 2019 to 2021. Results. In the whole sample, higher baseline serum 25(OH)D levels were linked with a lower risk of cumulative incident depression within two-year follow-ups (adjusted RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.94–0.99) and the increasing trajectory of depression symptoms across the three waves (adjusted RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.95–0.99). Baseline vitamin D deficiency (VDD) (adjusted RR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.10–2.05) were associated with an increased risk for the increasing trajectory of depression symptoms across the three waves. Remitted VDD was positively related to one dichotomous depression symptoms across three waves (adjusted OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.15–4.01). The above-mentioned significant association was also found in males. Additionally, baseline VDD (adjusted OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.04–2.44) and persistent VDD (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.02–2.60) were linked to an increased risk of having two dichotomous depression symptoms only in males. Conclusions. Our results highlight a prospective association between baseline vitamin D and depression risk in early adolescents. Additionally, a male-specific association between vitamin D and depression risk was observed. Our findings support a potential beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation in reducing depression risk in early adolescents. © The Author(s), 2022.

We aimed to examine whether early childhood adversities are associated with middle childhood psychotic experiences in a cohort of children at familial high risk of schizophrenia (FHR-SZ), bipolar disorder (FHR-BP) and population-based controls (controls). Methods Four hundred and forty-six children from The Danish High Risk and Resilience Study - VIA7 and VIA11 participated in this study (FHR-SZ = 170; FHR-BP = 103; controls = 173). Exposure to early childhood adversities and psychotic experiences were assessed using face-to-face interviews. Having childhood adversities assessed at baseline (age 7) was used as predictor. Psychotic experiences assessed at follow-up (age 11) were used as outcome. Results Across the sample, exposure to early childhood interpersonal adversities was associated with an increased risk for any middle childhood psychotic experiences and subclinical delusions when adjusting for relevant confounders (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.1, p = 0.05; OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.6-5.6, p < 0.001). There was no significant dose-response effect of exposure to multiple types of childhood adversities on any psychotic experiences. There were no interaction effects between early childhood adversities and FHR on middle childhood psychotic experiences. Exploratory analyses revealed that experiencing domestic violence in early childhood was associated with any middle childhood psychotic experiences (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.1, p = 0.001). Conclusions Exposure to interpersonal adversities during early childhood is associated with an increased risk for middle childhood psychotic experiences including specifically subclinical delusions. Future studies should examine associations between exposure to childhood adversities and conversion to psychosis within this cohort.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

However, the possible causal relationship between these factors has yet to be elucidated. Moreover, it is not known whether certain symptoms of MDD are more impairing than others. The network approach is a promising solution to these shortfalls. Methods The baseline data of a multicenter prospective project conducted in 11 governances of China were analyzed. In total, 1385 patients with MDD were included. Depressive symptoms, functioning disability, and QOL were evaluated by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF). The network was estimated through the graphical Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique in combination with the directed acyclic graph. Results Three centrality metrics of the graphical LASSO showed that social life dysfunction, QOL, and late insomnia exhibited the highest strength centrality. The network accuracy and stability were estimated to be robust and stable. The Bayesian network indicated that some depressive symptoms were directly associated with QOL, while other depressive symptoms showed an indirect association with QOL mediated by impaired function. Depressed mood was positioned at the highest level in the model and predicted the activation of functional impairment and anxiety. Conclusions Functional disability mediated the relationship between depressive symptoms and QOL. Family functionality and suicidal symptoms were directly related to QOL. Depressed mood played the predominant role in activating both anxiety symptom and functional impairment. © The Author(s), 2022.","Article","Scopus"

This study aimed to estimate the population-attributable risk of psychiatric disorders associated with suicide among Taiwanese youth aged 10-24 years. Methods Data were obtained from the National Death Registry and National Health Insurance (NHI) claims database between 2007 and 2019. Youth who died by suicide were included, and comparisons, 1:10 matched by age and sex, were randomly selected from the Registry for NHI beneficiaries. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate suicide odds ratios for psychiatric disorders. The population-attributable fractions (PAF) were calculated for each psychiatric disorder. Results A total of 2345 youth suicide and 23 450 comparisons were included. Overall, 44.8% of suicides had a psychiatric disorder, while only 7.9% of the comparisons had a psychiatric disorder. The combined PAF for all psychiatric disorders was 55.9%. The top three psychiatric conditions of the largest PAFs were major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and sleep disorder. In the analysis stratified by sex, the combined PAF was 45.5% for males and 69.2% for females. The PAF among young adults aged 20-24 years (57.0%) was higher than among adolescents aged 10-19 years (48.0%). Conclusions Our findings of high PAF from major depressive disorder, dysthymia, and sleep disorder to youth suicides suggest that youth suicide prevention that focuses on detecting and treating mental illness may usefully target these disorders.

Age of onset serves as a useful subtyping scheme for distinguishing OCD into two subgroups that aligns with neurodevelopmental perspectives. The underlying neurobiological markers for these distinct neurodevelopmental differences can be identified by investigating gyrification changes to establish biological evidence-based homogeneous subtypes. Methods We compared whole-brain cortical gyrification in 84 patients with early-onset OCD, 84 patients with late-onset OCD, and 152 healthy controls (HCs) to identify potential markers for early neurodevelopmental deficits using the local gyrification index (lGI). Then, the relationships between lGI in clusters showing significant differences and performance in visuospatial memory and verbal fluency, which are considered trait-related neurocognitive impairments in OCD, were further examined in early-onset OCD patients. Results The early-onset OCD patients exhibited significantly greater gyrification than those with late-onset OCD patients and HCs in frontoparietal and cingulate regions, including the bilateral precentral, postcentral, precuneus, paracentral, posterior cingulate, superior frontal, and caudal anterior cingulate gyri. Moreover, impaired neurocognitive functions in early-onset OCD patients were correlated with increased gyrification. Conclusions Our findings provide a neurobiological marker to distinguish the OCD population into more neurodevelopmentally homogeneous subtypes, which may contribute to the understanding of the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of an etiology in early-onset OCD consistent with the accumulated phenotypic evidence of greater neurodevelopmental deficits in early-onset OCD than in late-onset OCD.

Understanding deviations from typical brain development is a promising approach to comprehend pathophysiology in childhood and adolescence. We investigated if cerebellar volumes different than expected for age and sex could predict psychopathology, executive functions and academic achievement. Methods. Children and adolescents aged 6–17 years from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort Study for Mental Conditions had their cerebellar volume estimated using Multiple Automatically Generated Templates from T1-weighted images at baseline (n = 677) and at 3-year follow-up (n = 447). Outcomes were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist and standardized measures of executive functions and school achievement. Models of typically developing cerebellum were based on a subsample not exposed to risk factors and without mental-health conditions (n = 216). Deviations from this model were constructed for the remaining individuals (n = 461) and standardized variation from age and sex trajectory model was used to predict outcomes in cross-sectional, longitudinal and mediation analyses. Results. Cerebellar volumes higher than expected for age and sex were associated with lower externalizing specific factor and higher executive functions. In a longitudinal analysis, deviations from typical development at baseline predicted inhibitory control at follow-up, and cerebellar deviation changes from baseline to follow-up predicted changes in reading and writing abilities. The association between deviations in cerebellar volume and academic achievement was mediated by inhibitory control. Conclusions. Deviations in the cerebellar typical development are associated with outcomes in youth that have long-lasting consequences. This study highlights both the potential of typical developing models and the important role of the cerebellum in mental health, cognition and education. © The Author(s), 2022.

In the present study, we investigated affective and psychotic stress reactivity as well as its link with psychotic symptoms and psychopathology in youths with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), a neurogenetic condition associated with a high risk for psychosis. Methods A 6-day ecological momentary assessment protocol was used to assess perceived daily-life stress as well as affective and psychotic reactivity to stress in participants with 22q11DS (n = 38, age = 18.4) and healthy controls (HC; n = 53, age = 19.1). Psychotic symptoms, general psychopathology, and coping strategies were also assessed through clinical interviews and questionnaires. Results Participants with 22q11DS reported higher levels of perceived social stress (b = 0.21, p = 0.036) but lower levels of activity-related stress (b = -0.31, p = 0.003) in their daily lives compared to HC. The groups did not differ in affective or psychotic reactivity to stress, but individuals with 22q11DS who reported increased affective reactivity to social stressors showed more severe positive psychotic symptoms (rs = 0.505, p = 0.008). Finally, avoidance coping strategies moderated the association between stress and negative affects. Conclusions Our results suggest an increased vulnerability for daily social stress in youths with 22q11DS, and link elevated social stress reactivity to heightened psychotic symptom severity. Given the high risk for psychosis in 22q11DS, interventions should focus on reducing social stress and developing adaptive coping strategies.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

While neural correlates of reward-seeking and loss-avoidance have been examined in PSZ, neural correlates of uncertainty-driven exploration have not. Understanding neural correlates of uncertainty-driven exploration is an important next step that could reveal insights to how this mechanism of cognitive and negative symptoms manifest at a neural level. Methods We acquired fMRI data from 29 PSZ and 36 controls performing the Temporal Utility Integration decision-making task. Computational analyses estimated parameters corresponding to learning rates for both positive and negative reward prediction errors (RPEs) and the degree to which participates relied on representations of relative uncertainty. Trial-wise estimates of expected value, certainty, and RPEs were generated to model fMRI data. Results Behaviorally, PSZ demonstrated reduced reward-seeking behavior compared to controls, and negative symptoms were positively correlated with loss-avoidance behavior. This finding of a bias toward loss avoidance learning in PSZ is consistent with previous work. Surprisingly, neither behavioral measures of exploration nor neural correlates of uncertainty in the rlPFC differed significantly between groups. However, we showed that trial-wise estimates of relative uncertainty in the rlPFC distinguished participants who engaged in exploratory behavior from those who did not. rlPFC activation was positively associated with intellectual function. Conclusions These results further elucidate the nature of reinforcement learning and decision-making in PSZ and healthy volunteers.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

However, few studies have explored the relationships among clinical characteristics of BD, cognitive dysfunction, and aging. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis in euthymic participants with the MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Battery, the Trail Making Test B, the Stroop Test, and the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading. Age- and gender-equated control participants without a mental disorder ['Healthy Controls' - HC)] were assessed similarly. We compared cognitive performance both globally and in seven domains in four groups: younger BD (age ≤49 years; n = 70), older BD (age ≥50 years; n = 48), younger HC (n = 153), and older HC (n = 44). We also compared the BD and HC groups using age as a continuous measure. We controlled for relevant covariates and applied a Bonferroni correction. Results Our results support both an early impairment ('early hit') model and an accelerated aging model: impairment in attention/vigilance, processing speed, and executive function/working memory were congruent with the accelerated aging hypothesis whereas impairment in verbal memory was congruent with an early impairment model. BD and HC participants exhibited similar age-related decline in reasoning/problem solving and visuospatial memory. There were no age- or diagnosis-related differences in social cognition. Conclusion Our findings support that different cognitive domains are affected differently by BD and aging. Longitudinal studies are needed to explore trajectories of cognitive performance in BD across the lifespan. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Specifically, effects of partial dopamine agonism, sex, and clinical correlates on rCBF are sparsely investigated. We therefore assessed rCBF in antipsychotic-naïve psychosis patients before and after aripiprazole monotherapy and related findings to sex and symptom improvement. Methods We assessed rCBF with the pseudo-Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling (PCASL) sequence in 49 first-episode patients (22.6 ± 5.2 years, 58% females) and 50 healthy controls (HCs) (22.3 ± 4.4 years, 63% females) at baseline and in 29 patients and 49 HCs after six weeks. RCBF in striatum and thalamus was estimated with a region-of-interest (ROI) approach. Psychopathology was assessed with the positive and negative syndrome scale. Results Baseline rCBF in striatum and thalamus was not altered in the combined patient group compared with HCs, but female patients had lower striatal rCBF compared with male patients (p = 0.009). Treatment with a partial dopamine agonist increased rCBF significantly in striatum (p = 0.006) in the whole patient group, but not significantly in thalamus. Baseline rCBF in nucleus accumbens was negatively associated with improvement in positive symptoms (p = 0.046), but baseline perfusion in whole striatum and thalamus was not related to treatment outcome. Conclusions The findings suggest that striatal perfusion is increased by partial dopamine agonism and decreased in female patients prior to first treatment. This underlines the importance of treatment effects and sex differences when investigating the neurobiology of psychosis.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Mood disorders require consistent management of symptoms to prevent recurrences of mood episodes. Circadian rhythm (CR) disruption is a key symptom of mood disorders to be proactively managed to prevent mood episode recurrences. This study aims to predict impending mood episodes recurrences using digital phenotypes related to CR obtained from wearable devices and smartphones. Methods. The study is a multicenter, nationwide, prospective, observational study with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder I, and bipolar II disorder. A total of 495 patients were recruited from eight hospitals in South Korea. Patients were followed up for an average of 279.7 days (a total sample of 75 506 days) with wearable devices and smartphones and with clinical interviews conducted every 3 months. Algorithms predicting impending mood episodes were developed with machine learning. Algorithm-predicted mood episodes were then compared to those identified through face-to-face clinical interviews incorporating ecological momentary assessments of daily mood and energy. Results. Two hundred seventy mood episodes recurred in 135 subjects during the follow-up period. The prediction accuracies for impending major depressive episodes, manic episodes, and hypomanic episodes for the next 3 days were 90.1, 92.6, and 93.0%, with the area under the curve values of 0.937, 0.957, and 0.963, respectively. Conclusions. We predicted the onset of mood episode recurrences exclusively using digital phenotypes. Specifically, phenotypes indicating CR misalignment contributed the most to the prediction of episodes recurrences. Our findings suggest that monitoring of CR using digital devices can be useful in preventing and treating mood disorders. © The Author(s), 2022.

As an integral ingredient of human sociality, prosocial behavior requires learning what acts can benefit or harm others. However, it remains unknown how individuals adjust prosocial learning to avoid punishment or to pursue reward. Given that arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide that has been involved in modulating various social behaviors in mammals, it could be a crucial neurochemical facilitator that supports prosocial learning. Methods. In 50 placebo controls and 54 participants with AVP administration, we examined the modulation of AVP on the prosocial learning characterized by reward and punishment framework, as well as its underlying neurocomputational mechanisms combining computational modeling, event-related potentials and oscillations. Results. We found a self-bias that individuals learn to avoid punishment asymmetrically more severely than reward-seeking. Importantly, AVP increased behavioral performances and learning rates when making decisions to avoid losses for others and to obtain gains for self. These behavioral effects were underpinned by larger responses of stimulus-preceding negativity (SPN) to anticipation, as well as higher punishment-related feedback-related negativity (FRN) for prosocial learning and reward-related P300 for proself benefits, while FRN and P300 neural processes were integrated into theta (4–7 Hz) oscillation at the outcome evaluation stage. Conclusions. These results suggest that AVP context-dependently up-regulates altruism for concerning others’ losses and reward-seeking for self-oriented benefits. Our findings provide insight into the selectively modulatory roles of AVP in prosocial behaviors depending on learning contexts between proself reward-seeking and prosocial punishment-avoidance. © The Author(s), 2022.

Use of intensive longitudinal methods (e.g. ecological momentary assessment, passive sensing) and machine learning (ML) models to predict risk for depression and suicide has increased in recent years. However, these studies often vary considerably in length, ML methods used, and sources of data. The present study examined predictive accuracy for depression and suicidal ideation (SI) as a function of time, comparing different combinations of ML methods and data sources. Methods. Participants were 2459 first-year training physicians (55.1% female; 52.5% White) who were provided with Fitbit wearable devices and assessed daily for mood. Linear [elastic net regression (ENR)] and non-linear (random forest) ML algorithms were used to predict depression and SI at the first-quarter follow-up assessment, using two sets of variables (daily mood features only, daily mood features + passive-sensing features). To assess accuracy over time, models were estimated iteratively for each of the first 92 days of internship, using data available up to that point in time. Results. ENRs using only the daily mood features generally had the best accuracy for predicting mental health outcomes, and predictive accuracy within 1 standard error of the full 92 day models was attained by weeks 7–8. Depression at 92 days could be predicted accurately (area under the curve >0.70) after only 14 days of data collection. Conclusions. Simpler ML methods may outperform more complex methods until passive-sensing features become better specified. For intensive longitudinal studies, there may be limited predictive value in collecting data for more than 2 months. © The Author(s), 2022.

Altered white matter brain connectivity has been linked to depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of markers of white matter connectivity with prevalence, incidence and course of depressive symptoms. Methods. Markers of white matter connectivity (node degree, clustering coefficient, local efficiency, characteristic path length, and global efficiency) were assessed at baseline by 3 T MRI in the population-based Maastricht Study (n = 4866; mean ± standard deviation age 59.6 ± 8.5 years, 49.0% women; 17 406 person-years of follow-up). Depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire; PHQ-9) were assessed at baseline and annually over seven years of follow-up. Major depressive disorder (MDD) was assessed with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview at baseline only. We used negative binominal, logistic and Cox regression analyses, and adjusted for demographic, cardiovascular, and lifestyle risk factors. Results. A lower global average node degree at baseline was associated with the prevalence and persistence of clinically relevant depressive symptoms [PHQ-9 ≽ 10; OR (95% confidence interval) per standard deviation = 1.21 (1.05–1.39) and OR = 1.21 (1.02–1.44), respectively], after full adjustment. On the contrary, no associations were found of global average node degree with the MDD at baseline [OR 1.12 (0.94–1.32) nor incidence or remission of clinically relevant depressive symptoms [HR = 1.05 (0.95–1.17) and OR 1.08 (0.83–1.41), respectively]. Other connectivity measures of white matter organization were not associated with depression. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that fewer white matter connections may contribute to prevalent depressive symptoms and its persistence but not to incident depression.

Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) tends to co-occur with greater alcohol consumption as well as alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, it is unknown whether the same etiologic factors that underlie PTSD-alcohol-related problems comorbidity also contribute to PTSD- alcohol consumption. Methods. We used summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of European-ancestry (EA) and African-ancestry (AA) participants to estimate genetic correlations between PTSD and a range of alcohol consumption-related and alcohol-related problems phenotypes. Results. In EAs, there were positive genetic correlations between PTSD phenotypes and alcohol-related problems phenotypes (e.g. Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) problem score) (rGs: 0.132−0.533, all FDR adjusted p < 0.05). However, the genetic correlations between PTSD phenotypes and alcohol consumption -related phenotypes (e.g. drinks per week) were negatively associated or non-significant (rGs: −0.417 to −0.042, FDR adjusted p: <0.05-NS). For AAs, the direction of correlations was sometimes consistent and sometimes inconsistent with that in EAs, and the ranges were larger (rGs for alcohol-related problems: −0.275 to 0.266, FDR adjusted p: NS, alcohol consumption-related: 0.145–0.699, FDR adjusted p: NS). Conclusions. These findings illustrate that the genetic associations between consumption and problem alcohol phenotypes and PTSD differ in both strength and direction. Thus, the genetic factors that may lead someone to develop PTSD and high levels of alcohol consumption are not the same as those that lead someone to develop PTSD and alcohol-related problems. Discussion around needing improved methods to better estimate heritabilities and genetic correlations in diverse and admixed ancestry samples is provided. © The Author(s), 2022.

However, the neurocognitive mechanism(s) underlying adolescent social anxiety remain unclear. Emerging work points to the error-related negativity (ERN) as a potential neural marker of exaggerated self/error-monitoring in social anxiety, particularly for errors committed in front of peers. However, social anxiety symptoms are marked by heterogeneity and it remains unclear exactly what domain(s) of social anxiety symptoms are associated with ERN variation in peer presence, particularly within the adolescent period. Methods To advance and deepen the mechanistic understanding of the ERN's putative role as a neural marker for social anxiety in adolescence, we leveraged a social manipulation procedure and assessed a developmentally salient domain of social anxiety during adolescence - fear of negative evaluation (FNE). Adolescents residing in Hanzhong, a small city in the southwestern region of mainland China, had EEG recorded while performing a flanker task, twice (peer presence/absence); FNE, as well as global social anxiety symptoms, was assessed. Results Overall ERN increases in peer presence. FNE specifically, but not global levels of social anxiety symptoms, predicted ERN in peer presence. Conclusions These data are the first demonstration that the ERN relates to a specific domain of social anxiety in adolescents, as well as the first evidence of such relations within a non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) sample. Results have important implications for theory and research into adolescent social anxiety.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Evidence on neonatal withdrawal syndrome following antidepressant intrauterine exposure is limited, particularly for antidepressants other than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs). Methods. In our case/non-case pharmacovigilance study, based on VigiBase®, the WHO database of suspected adverse drug reactions, we estimated reporting odds ratio (ROR) and the Bayesian information component (IC) with 95% confidence/credibility intervals (CI) as measures of disproportionate reporting of antidepressant-related neonatal withdrawal syndrome. Antidepressants were first compared to all other medications, then to methadone, and finally within each class of antidepressants: SSRIs, tricyclics (TCA) and other antidepressants. Antidepressants were ranked in terms of clinical priority, based on semiquantitative score ratings. Serious v. non-serious reports were compared. Results. A total of 406 reports of neonatal withdrawal syndrome in 379 neonates related to 15 antidepressants were included. Disproportionate reporting was detected for antidepressants as a group as compared to all other drugs (ROR: 6.18, 95% CI 5.45–7.01, IC: 2.07, 95% CI 1.92–2.21). Signals were found for TCAs (10.55, 95% CI 8.02–13.88), followed by other antidepressants (ROR: 5.90, 95% CI 4.74–7.36) and SSRIs (ROR: 4.68, 95% CI 4.04–5.42). Significant disproportionality emerged for all individual antidepressants except for bupropion, whereas no disproportionality for any antidepressant was detected v. methadone. Eleven antidepressants had a moderate clinical priority score and four had a weak one. Most frequent symptoms included respiratory symptoms (n = 106), irritability/agitation (n = 75), tremor (n = 52) and feeding problems (n = 40). Conclusions. Most antidepressants are associated with moderate signals of disproportionate reporting for neonatal withdrawal syndrome, which should be considered when prescribing an antidepressant during pregnancy, irrespective of class. © The Author(s), 2022.

Approximately 15% of patients with major depressive disorder are refractory to currently available treatments. We hypothesized metabolic abnormalities contributing to treatment refractory depression are associated with distinct findings identifiable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our hypothesis was confirmed by a previous small case-controlled study. Here we present a second, larger replication study. Methods We conducted a case-controlled, targeted, metabolomic evaluation of 141 adolescent and adult patients with well-characterized history of depression refractory to three maximum-dose, adequate-duration medication treatments, and 36 healthy controls. Plasma, urine, and CSF metabolic profiling were performed by coupled gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and high-performance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization, tandem mass spectrometry. Results Abnormalities were identified in 67 of 141 treatment refractory depression participants. The CSF abnormalities included: low cerebral folate (n = 20), low tetrahydrobiopterin intermediates (n = 11), and borderline low-tetrahydrobiopterin intermediates (n = 20). Serum abnormalities included abnormal acylcarnitine profile (n = 12) and abnormal serum amino acids (n = 20). Eighteen patients presented with two or more abnormal metabolic findings. Sixteen patients with cerebral folate deficiency and seven with low tetrahydrobiopterin intermediates in CSF showed improvement in depression symptom inventories after treatment with folinic acid and sapropterin, respectively. No healthy controls had a metabolite abnormality. Conclusions Examination of metabolic disorders in treatment refractory depression identified an unexpectedly large proportion of patients with potentially treatable abnormalities. The etiology of these abnormalities and their potential roles in pathogenesis remain to be determined. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

This study aims to identify functional network abnormalities using a multivariate data-driven method in a relatively large and homogenous sample of SAD patients, and assess their potential diagnostic value. Methods Forty-six SAD patients and 52 demographically-matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited to undergo clinical evaluation and resting-state functional MRI scanning. We used group independent component analysis to characterize the functional architecture of brain resting-state networks (RSNs) and investigate between-group differences in intra-/inter-network functional network connectivity (FNC). Furtherly, we explored the associations of FNC abnormalities with clinical characteristics, and assessed their ability to discriminate SAD from HC using support vector machine analyses. Results SAD patients showed widespread intra-network FNC abnormalities in the default mode network, the subcortical network and the perceptual system (i.e. sensorimotor, auditory and visual networks), and large-scale inter-network FNC abnormalities among those high-order and primary RSNs. Some aberrant FNC signatures were correlated to disease severity and duration, suggesting pathophysiological relevance. Furthermore, intrinsic FNC anomalies allowed individual classification of SAD v. HC with significant accuracy, indicating potential diagnostic efficacy. Conclusions SAD patients show distinct patterns of functional synchronization abnormalities both within and across large-scale RSNs, reflecting or causing a network imbalance of bottom-up response and top-down regulation in cognitive, emotional and sensory domains. Therefore, this could offer insights into the neurofunctional substrates of SAD. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Methods A community sample (N = 374; 53.5% male) of children and their families completed tri-annual assessments across ages 3-15. The feature set included several important risk factors spanning psychopathology, temperament/personality, family environment, life stress, interpersonal relationships, neurocognitive, hormonal, and neural functioning, and parental psychopathology and personality. We used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to reduce the large feature set to a lower dimensional space while preserving the longitudinal structure of the data. Ablation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relative contributions to prediction of information gathered at different developmental periods and relative to previous disorder status (i.e. age 12 depression or anxiety) and demographics (sex, race, ethnicity). Results CCA components from individual waves predicted age 15 disorder status better than chance across ages 3, 6, 9, and 12 for anxiety and 9 and 12 for depression. Only the components from age 12 for depression, and ages 9 and 12 for anxiety, improved prediction over prior disorder status and demographics. Conclusions These findings suggest that screening for risk of adolescent depression can be successful as early as age 9, while screening for risk of adolescent anxiety can be successful as early as age 3. Assessing additional risk factors at age 12 for depression, and going back to age 9 for anxiety, can improve screening for risk at age 15 beyond knowing standard demographics and disorder history.

The 'leapfrog' trial design is a newly-developed simple Bayesian adaptive trial design with potential to accelerate treatment development. A first leapfrog trial was conducted to provide a demonstration and test feasibility, applying the method to a low-intensity internet-delivered intervention targeting anhedonia. Methods At the start of this online, single-blind leapfrog trial, participants self-reporting depression were randomized to an initial control arm comprising four weeks of weekly questionnaires, or one of two versions of a four-week cognitive training intervention, imagery cognitive bias modification (imagery CBM). Intervention arms were compared to control on an ongoing basis via sequential Bayesian analyses, based on a primary outcome of anhedonia at post-intervention. Results were used to eliminate and replace arms, or to promote them to become the control condition based on pre-specified Bayes factor and sample size thresholds. Two further intervention arms (variants of imagery CBM) were added into the trial as it progressed. Results N = 188 participants were randomized across the five trial arms. The leapfrog methodology was successfully implemented to identify a 'winning' version of the imagery CBM, i.e. the version most successful in reducing anhedonia, following sequential elimination of the other arms. Conclusions The study demonstrates feasibility of the leapfrog design and provides a foundation for its adoption as a method to accelerate treatment development in mental health.

Emergency service workers (ESW) are known to be at increased risk of mental disorders but population-level and longitudinal data regarding their risk of suicide are lacking. Method. Suicide data for 2001–2017 were extracted from the Australian National Coronial Information Service (NCIS) for two occupational groups: ESW (ambulance personnel, firefighters and emergency workers, police officers) and individuals employed in all other occupations. Age-standardised suicide rates were calculated and risk of suicide compared using negative binomial regression modelling. Results. 13 800 suicide cases were identified among employed adults (20–69 years) over the study period. The age-standardised suicide rate across all ESW was 14.3 per 100 000 (95% CI 11.0–17.7) compared to 9.8 per 100 000 (95% CI 9.6–9.9) for other occupations. Significant occupational differences in the method of suicide were identified (p < 0.001). There was no evidence for increased risk of suicide among ESW compared to other occupations once age, gender and year of death were accounted for (RR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.84–1.17; p = 0.95). In contrast, there was a trend for ambulance personnel to be at elevated risk of suicide (RR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.00–2.00, p = 0.053). Conclusion. Whilst age-standardised suicide rates among ESW are higher than other occupations, emergency service work was not independently associated with an increased risk of suicide, with the exception of an observed trend in ambulance personnel. Despite an increased focus on ESW mental health and wellbeing over the last two decades, there was no evidence that rates of suicide among ESW are changing over time. © The Author(s), 2022.

We investigated the effect of discontinuing maintenance antidepressant treatment on positive and negative self-referential recall and the association between self-referential recall and risk of relapse. Methods The ANTLER trial was a large (N = 478) pragmatic double-blind trial investigating the clinical effectiveness of long-term antidepressant treatment for preventing relapse in primary care patients. Participants were randomised to continue their maintenance antidepressants or discontinue via a taper to placebo. We analysed memory for positive and negative personality descriptors, assessed at baseline, 12- and 52-week follow-up. Results The recall task was completed by 437 participants. There was no evidence of an effect of discontinuation on self-referential recall at 12 [positive recall ratio 1.00, 95% CI (0.90-1.11), p = 0.93; negative recall ratio 1.00 (0.87-1.14), p = 0.87] or 52 weeks [positive recall ratio 1.03 (0.91-1.17), p = 0.62; negative recall ratio 1.00 (0.86-1.15), p = 0.96; ratios larger than one indicate higher recall in the discontinuation group], and no evidence of an association between recall at baseline or 12 weeks and later relapse [baseline, positive hazard ratio (HR) 1.02 (0.93-1.12), p = 0.74; negative HR 1.01 (0.90-1.13), p = 0.87; 12 weeks, positive HR 0.99 (0.89-1.09), p = 0.81; negative HR 0.98 (0.84-1.14), p = 0.78; ratios larger than one indicate a higher frequency of relapse in those with higher recall]. Conclusions We found no evidence that discontinuing long-term antidepressants altered self-referential recall or that self-referential recall was associated with risk of relapse.

This study investigated the extent to which the increased risk for dementia in depression is explained by modifiable dementia risk factors. Methods We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2008-2009 to 2018-2019), a prospective cohort study. A total of 7460 individuals were included [mean(standard deviation) age, 65.7 ± 9.4 years; 3915(54.7%) were women]. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-8 (score ≥3) or self-reported doctor's diagnosis. Ten modifiable risk factors for dementia were combined in the 'LIfestyle for BRAin health' (LIBRA) score. Dementia was determined by physician diagnosis, self-reported Alzheimer's disease or the shortened version of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (average score ≥3.38). Structural equation modelling was used to test mediation of LIBRA score. Results During 61 311 person-years, 306 individuals (4.1%) developed dementia. Participants aged 50-70 years with depressive symptoms had higher LIBRA scores [difference(s.e.) = 1.15(0.10)] and a 3.59 times increased dementia risk [HR(95% CI) = 3.59(2.20-5.84)], adjusted for age, sex, education, wealth and clustering at the household level. In total, 10.4% of the dementia risk was mediated by differences in LIBRA score [indirect effect: HR = 1.14(1.03-1.26)], while 89.6% was attributed to a direct effect of depressive symptoms on dementia risk [direct effect: HR = 3.14(2.20-5.84)]. Conclusions Modifiable dementia risk factors can be important targets for the prevention of dementia in individuals with depressive symptoms during midlife.

The purpose of this multicentre, evaluator blinded RCT was to investigate the added value of MBCT to treatment as usual (TAU) in BD up to 15 months follow-up (NCT03507647). Methods A total of 144 participants with BD type I and II were randomised to MBCT + TAU (n = 72) and TAU (n = 72). Primary outcome was current depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were current (hypo)manic and anxiety symptoms, recurrence rates, rumination, dampening of positive affect, functional impairment, mindfulness skills, self-compassion, and positive mental health. Potential moderators of treatment outcome were examined. Results MBCT + TAU was not more efficacious than TAU in reducing current depressive symptoms at post-treatment (95% CI [-7.0 to 1.8], p = 0.303, d = 0.24) or follow-up (95% CI [-2.2 to 6.3], p = 0.037, d = 0.13). At post-treatment, MBCT + TAU was more effective than TAU in improving mindfulness skills. At follow-up, TAU was more effective than MBCT + TAU in reducing trait anxiety and improving mindfulness skills and positive mental health. Exploratory analysis revealed that participants with higher depressive symptoms and functional impairment at baseline benefitted more from MBCT + TAU than TAU.

At present, it is still under debate whether this dysfunctional response is specific to the full-blown SCZ diagnosis or rather a marker of psychosis in general. The present study tested MMN in patients with SCZ, bipolar disorder (BD), first episode of psychosis (FEP), and in people at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR). Methods Source-based MEG activity evoked during a passive auditory oddball task was recorded from 135 patients grouped according to diagnosis (SCZ, BD, FEP, and CHR) and 135 healthy controls also divided into four subgroups, age- and gender-matched with diagnostic subgroups. The magnetic MMN (mMMN) was analyzed as event-related field (ERF), Theta power, and Theta inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC). Results The clinical group as a whole showed reduced mMMN ERF amplitude, Theta power, and Theta ITPC, without any statistically significant interaction between diagnosis and mMMN reductions. The mMMN subgroup contrasts showed lower ERF amplitude in all the diagnostic subgroups. In the analysis of Theta frequency, SCZ showed significant power and ITPC reductions, while only indications of diminished ITPC were observed in CHR, but no significant decreases characterized BD and FEP. Conclusions Significant mMMN alterations in people experiencing psychosis, also for diagnoses other than SCZ, suggest that this neurophysiological response may be a feature shared across psychotic disorders. Additionally, reduced Theta ITPC may be associated with risk for psychosis. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We conducted the first comprehensive meta-analysis of the outcomes of this emerging field. Methods We used the searches in PubMed, PsychINFO, Embase and the Cochrane library of an existing database of randomised trials of psychological interventions for depression to identify studies comparing a transdiagnostic treatment of patients with depression or anxiety with a control group (deadline 1 January 2022). We conducted random-effects meta-analyses and examined the effects on depression and anxiety at the short and longer term. Results We included 45 randomised controlled trials with 51 comparisons between a psychotherapy and a control group and 5530 participants. Thirty-five (78%) studies were conducted in the last 10 years. The overall effect size was g = 0.54 (95% CI 0.40-0.69; NNT = 5.87), with high heterogeneity (I2 = 78; 95% CI 71-83), and a broad PI (-0.31-1.39). The effects remained significant in a series of sensitivity analyses, including exclusion of outliers, adjustment for publication bias, for studies with low risk of bias, and in multilevel analyses. The results were comparable for depression and anxiety separately. At 6 months after randomisation the main effects were still significant, but not at 12 months, although the number of studies was small. Conclusions Transdiagnostic treatments of patients with depression or anxiety are increasingly examined and are probably effective at the short term. © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

While suicide rates have recently declined for White individuals, rates among Black and Hispanic individuals have increased. Yet, little is known about racial/ethnic differences in precursors to suicide, including suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA). Methods. Data from 2009–2020 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) consisted of non-institutionalized US civilians aged ≽18 (n = 426 008). We compared proportions of White, Black, and Hispanics among adults reporting no past-year suicidal thoughts/behavior, SI, and SA. Multivariable-adjusted analyses were used to evaluate the independence of observed racial/ethnic differences in past-year SI, SA, and mental health service use. Results. In the entire sample, 20 791 (4.9%) reported past-year SI only and 3661 (0.9%) reported a SA. Compared to White individuals, Black and Hispanic individuals were significantly less likely to report past-year SI [OR 0.73 (95% CI 0.69–0.77); OR 0.75 (95% CI 0.71–0.79), respectively], but more likely to report a past-year SA [OR 1.45 (95% CI 1.28–1.64); OR 1.19 (95% CI 1.04–1.37), respectively] even after multivariable adjustment. Black and Hispanic individuals were significantly less likely to use mental health services, but the lack of significant interactions between race/ethnicity and SI/SA in association with service use suggests differences in service use do not account for differences in SI or SA. Conclusions. Black and Hispanic individuals are significantly less likely than White individuals to report SI but more likely to report SAs, suggesting differences in suicidal behavior across race/ethnicity that may be impacted by socio-culturally acceptable expressions of distress and structural racism in the healthcare system. © The Author(s), 2022.

We therefore investigated the extent to which premorbid adjustment trajectories predict cognitive remediation gains in schizophrenia. Methods In a total sample of 215 participants (170 first-episode schizophrenia participants and 45 controls), we classified premorbid functioning trajectories from childhood through late adolescence using the Cannon-Spoor Premorbid Adjustment Scale. For the 62 schizophrenia participants who underwent 6 months of computer-assisted, bottom-up cognitive remediation interventions, we identified MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery scores for which participants demonstrated mean changes after intervention, then evaluated whether developmental trajectories predicted these changes. Results Growth mixture models supported three premorbid functioning trajectories: stable-good, deteriorating, and stable-poor adjustment. Schizophrenia participants demonstrated significant cognitive remediation gains in processing speed, verbal learning, and overall cognition. Notably, participants with stable-poor trajectories demonstrated significantly greater improvements in processing speed compared to participants with deteriorating trajectories. Conclusions This is the first study to our knowledge to characterize the associations between premorbid functioning trajectories and cognitive remediation gains after schizophrenia onset, indicating that 6 months of bottom-up cognitive remediation appears to be sufficient to yield a full standard deviation gain in processing speed for individuals with early, enduring functioning difficulties. Our findings highlight the connection between trajectories of premorbid and postmorbid functioning in schizophrenia and emphasize the utility of considering the lifespan developmental course in personalizing therapeutic interventions.

Childhood trauma influences the clinical features of schizophrenia. In this study, we examined how childhood trauma and perceived stress are associated with clinical manifestations and subcortical gray matter volumes (GMVs) in patients with schizophrenia. Methods. We recruited 127 patients with schizophrenia and 83 healthy controls for assessment of early childhood trauma, perceived stress, and clinical symptoms. With structural brain imaging, we identified the GMVs of subcortical structures and examined the relationships between childhood trauma, perceived stress, clinical symptoms, and subcortical GMVs. Results. Compared to controls, patients with schizophrenia showed higher levels of childhood trauma and perceived stress. Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly smaller amygdala and hippocampus GMVs as well as total cortical GMVs than age-matched controls. Childhood trauma score was significantly correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms, depression, perceived stress, and amygdala GMVs. Perceived stress was significantly correlated with clinical symptoms, depression, and hippocampus and amygdala GMVs. Further, the association between childhood trauma (emotional neglect) and stress coping ability was mediated by right amygdala GMV in patients with schizophrenia. Conclusions. Patients with schizophrenia had more exposure to early-life trauma and poorer stress coping. Both childhood trauma and perceived stress were associated with smaller amygdala volumes. The relationship between early-life trauma and perceived stress was mediated by right amygdala GMV in patients with schizophrenia. These findings together suggest the long-term effects of childhood trauma on perceived stress and the subcortical volumetric correlates of the effects in schizophrenia. © The Author(s), 2022.

However, reliance on endpoint outcomes ignores additional interindividual variation during therapy. Knowing a patient's likely symptom trajectories could guide clinical decisions. We aimed to identify latent classes of patients with similar symptom trajectories over the course of psychological therapy and explore associations between baseline variables and trajectory class. Methods Patients received high-intensity psychological treatment for common mental health problems at National Health Service Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services in South London (N = 16 258). To identify trajectories, we performed growth mixture modelling of depression and anxiety symptoms over 11 sessions. We then ran multinomial regressions to identify baseline variables associated with trajectory class membership. Results Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms were highly similar and best modelled by four classes. Three classes started with moderate-severe symptoms and showed (1) no change, (2) gradual improvement, and (3) fast improvement. A final class (4) showed initially mild symptoms and minimal improvement. Within the moderate-severe baseline symptom classes, patients in the two showing improvement as opposed to no change tended not to be prescribed psychotropic medication or report a disability and were in employment. Patients showing fast improvement additionally reported lower baseline functional impairment on average. Conclusions Multiple trajectory classes of depression and anxiety symptoms were associated with baseline characteristics. Identifying the most likely trajectory for a patient at the start of treatment could inform decisions about the suitability and continuation of therapy, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) was previously associated with negative affective biases. Evidence from larger population-based studies, however, is lacking, including whether biases normalise with remission. We investigated associations between affective bias measures and depressive symptom severity across a large community-based sample, followed by examining differences between remitted individuals and controls. Methods. Participants from Generation Scotland (N = 1109) completed the: (i) Bristol Emotion Recognition Task (BERT), (ii) Face Affective Go/No-go (FAGN), and (iii) Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT). Individuals were classified as MDD-current (n = 43), MDD-remitted (n = 282), or controls (n = 784). Analyses included using affective bias summary measures (primary analyses), followed by detailed emotion/condition analyses of BERT and FAGN (secondary analyses). Results. For summary measures, the only significant finding was an association between greater symptoms and lower risk adjustment for CGT across the sample (individuals with greater symptoms were less likely to bet more, despite increasingly favourable conditions). This was no longer significant when controlling for non-affective cognition. No differences were found for remitted-MDD v. controls. Detailed analysis of BERT and FAGN indicated subtle negative biases across multiple measures of affective cognition with increasing symptom severity, that were independent of non-effective cognition [e.g. greater tendency to rate faces as angry (BERT), and lower accuracy for happy/neutral conditions (FAGN)]. Results for remitted-MDD were inconsistent. Conclusions. This suggests the presence of subtle negative affective biases at the level of emotion/condition in association with depressive symptoms across the sample, over and above those accounted for by non-affective cognition, with no evidence for affective biases in remitted individuals. © The Author(s), 2022.

It is unclear whether the same association holds globally. This study examined the association between urban residence and rates of psychotic disorder in catchment areas in India (Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu), Nigeria (Ibadan, Oyo), and Northern Trinidad. Methods Comprehensive case detection systems were developed based on extensive pilot work to identify individuals aged 18-64 with previously untreated psychotic disorders residing in each catchment area (May 2018-April/May/July 2020). Area of residence and basic demographic details were collected for eligible cases. We compared rates of psychotic disorder in the more v. less urban administrative areas within each catchment area, based on all cases detected, and repeated these analyses while restricting to recent onset cases (<2 years/<5 years). Results We found evidence of higher overall rates of psychosis in more urban areas within the Trinidadian catchment area (IRR: 3.24, 95% CI 2.68-3.91), an inverse association in the Nigerian catchment area (IRR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.51-0.91) and no association in the Indian catchment area (IRR: 1.18, 95% CI 0.93-1.52). When restricting to recent onset cases, we found a modest positive association in the Indian catchment area. Conclusions This study suggests that urbanicity is associated with higher rates of psychotic disorder in some but not all contexts outside of Northern Europe. Future studies should test candidate mechanisms that may underlie the associations observed, such as exposure to violence. © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Abnormal brain dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) has been associated with the disorder. The full spectrum of ADHD-related variation of brain dynamics and its association with behavioral and cognitive features remain to be established. Methods We sought to identify patterns of brain dynamics linked to specific behavioral and cognitive dimensions using sparse canonical correlation analysis across a cohort of children with and without ADHD (122 children in total, 63 with ADHD). Then, using mediation analysis, we tested the hypothesis that cognitive deficits mediate the relationship between brain dynamics and ADHD-associated behaviors. Results We identified four distinct patterns of dFC, each corresponding to a specific dimension of behavioral or cognitive function (r = 0.811-0.879). Specifically, the inattention/hyperactivity dimension was positively associated with dFC within the default mode network (DMN) and negatively associated with dFC between DMN and the sensorimotor network (SMN); the somatization dimension was positively associated with dFC within DMN and SMN; the inhibition and flexibility dimension and fluency and memory dimensions were both positively associated with dFC within DMN and between DMN and SMN, and negatively associated with dFC between DMN and the fronto-parietal network. Furthermore, we observed that cognitive functions of inhibition and flexibility mediated the relationship between brain dynamics and behavioral manifestations of inattention and hyperactivity. Conclusions These findings document the importance of distinct patterns of dynamic functional brain activity for different cardinal behavioral and cognitive features related to ADHD.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Sexual minority men (SMM) experience higher suicidal ideation and suicide attempts than the general population. We examined the associations of adverse childhood experiences (ACES) and protective and compensatory childhood experiences (PACES) with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in adulthood via thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness among SMM. Methods. Data are from the UNITE study, a national longitudinal cohort study of HIV-negative SMM from the 50 U.S. states and Puerto Rico. Between 2017 and 2019, participants (N = 6303) completed web-based assessments at baseline and 12-month follow-up. ACES and PACES occurring before the age of 18, and current symptoms of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness were assessed at baseline. Past-week suicidal ideation and past-year suicide attempt were assessed at follow-up. Results. 424 (6.7%) participants reported past-week suicidal ideation and 123 (2.0%) reported a past-year suicide attempt. The results of our multivariate model suggest that each additional adverse childhood experience was prospectively associated with 14% higher odds of past-week suicidal ideation (AOR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.09–1.19) and 19% higher odds of past-year suicide attempt (AOR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.11–1.29). Each additional protective childhood experience was prospectively associated with 15% lower odds of past-week suicidal ideation (AOR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.81–0.90) and 11% lower odds of past-year suicide attempt (AOR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.82–0.98). Perceived burdensomeness partially mediated these prospective associations. Conclusion. To reduce suicide, screening and treating perceived burdensomeness among SMM with high ACES may be warranted. PACES may decrease perceived burdensomeness and associated suicide risk. © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

The current study challenged this view by exploring the hypothesis that negative symptoms are driven by a specific type of emotional experience abnormality, a reduction in the positivity offset (i.e. the tendency to experience greater levels of positive relative to negative emotion in low-arousal contexts), which limits the production of approach behaviors in neutral environments. Methods Participants included outpatients with SZ (n = 44) and healthy controls (CN: n = 48) who completed one week of active (ecological momentary assessment surveys of emotional experience and symptoms) and passive (geolocation, accelerometry) digital phenotyping. Mathematical modeling approaches from Cacioppo's Evaluative Space Model were used to quantify the positivity offset in daily life. Negative symptoms were assessed via standard clinical ratings, as well as active (EMA surveys) and passive (geolocation, accelerometry) digital phenotyping measures. Results Results indicated that the positivity offset was reduced in SZ and associated with more severe anhedonia and avolition measured via clinical interviews and active and passive digital phenotyping. Conclusions These findings suggest that current conceptual models of negative symptoms, which assume hedonic normality, may need to be revised to account for reductions in the positivity offset and its connection to diminished motivated behavior. Findings identify key real-world contexts where negative symptoms could be targeted using psychosocial treatments. © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Depression affects approximately 27% of adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney failure (ESKF). Depression in this population is associated with impaired quality of life and increased mortality. The extent of inflammation and the impact on depression in CKD/ESKF is yet to be established. Through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis, we aim to understand the relationship between depression and inflammation in CKD/ESKF patients. Methods. We searched nine electronic databases for published studies until January 2022. Titles and abstracts were screened against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction and study quality assessment was carried out independently by two reviewers. A meta-analysis was carried out where appropriate; otherwise a narrative review of studies was completed. Results. Sixty studies met our inclusion criteria and entered the review (9481 patients included in meta-analysis). Meta-analysis of cross-sectional associations revealed significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers; C-reactive protein; Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha in patients with depressive symptoms (DS) compared to patients without DS. Significantly lower levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were found in patients with DS compared to patients without DS. Considerable heterogeneity was detected in the analysis for most inflammatory markers. Conclusion. We found evidence for an association of higher levels of pro-inflammatory and lower anti-inflammatory cytokines and DS in patients with CKD/ESKF. Clinical trials are needed to investigate whether anti-inflammatory therapies will be effective in the prevention and treatment of DS in these patients with multiple comorbidities. © The Author(s), 2022.

We sought to quantify possible causal effects of recreational cannabis legalization on substance use, substance use disorder, and psychosocial functioning, and whether vulnerable individuals are more susceptible to the effects of cannabis legalization than others. Methods We used a longitudinal, co-twin control design in 4043 twins (N = 240 pairs discordant on residence), first assessed in adolescence and now age 24-49, currently residing in states with different cannabis policies (40% resided in a recreationally legal state). We tested the effect of legalization on outcomes of interest and whether legalization interacts with established vulnerability factors (age, sex, or externalizing psychopathology). Results In the co-twin control design accounting for earlier cannabis frequency and alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms respectively, the twin living in a recreational state used cannabis on average more often (βw = 0.11, p = 1.3 × 10-3), and had fewer AUD symptoms (βw = -0.11, p = 6.7 × 10-3) than their co-twin living in an non-recreational state. Cannabis legalization was associated with no other adverse outcome in the co-twin design, including cannabis use disorder. No risk factor significantly interacted with legalization status to predict any outcome. Conclusions Recreational legalization was associated with increased cannabis use and decreased AUD symptoms but was not associated with other maladaptations. These effects were maintained within twin pairs discordant for residence. Moreover, vulnerabilities to cannabis use were not exacerbated by the legal cannabis environment. Future research may investigate causal links between cannabis consumption and outcomes. © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Primary health care (PHC) professionals may play a crucial role in improving early diagnosis of depressive disorders. However, only 50% of cases are detected in PHC. The most widely used screening instrument for major depression is the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), including the two-, eight- and nine-item versions. Surprisingly, there is neither enough evidence about the validity of PHQ in PHC patients in Spain nor indications about how to interpret the total scores. This study aimed to gather validity evidence to support the use of the three PHQ versions to screen for major depression in PHC in Spain. Additionally, the present study provided information for helping professionals to choose the best PHQ version according to the context. Methods. The sample was composed of 2579 participants from 22 Spanish PHC centers participating in the EIRA-3 study. The reliability and validity of the three PHQ versions for Spanish PHC patients were assessed based on responses to the questionnaire. Results. The PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 showed high internal consistency. The results obtained confirm the theoretically expected relationship between PHQ results and anxiety, social support and health-related QoL. A single-factor solution was confirmed. Regarding to the level of agreement with the CIDI interview (used as the criterion), our results indicate that the PHQ has a good discrimination power. The optimal cut-off values were: ≽2 for PHQ-2, ≽7 for PHQ-8 and ≽8 for PHQ-9. Conclusions. PHQ is a good and valuable tool for detecting major depression in PHC patients in Spain. © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Insomnia symptoms are common during the postpartum period, yet interventions remain scarce. This trial aimed to simultaneously examine the efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and light dark therapy (LDT), targeting different mechanisms, against treatment-as-usual (TAU), in reducing maternal postpartum insomnia symptoms. Methods. This three-arm randomised controlled trial recruited from the general community in Australia. Nulliparous females 4–12 months postpartum with self-reported insomnia symptoms [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores >7] were included; severe medical/psychiatric conditions were excluded. Participants were randomised 1:1:1 to CBT, LDT, or TAU stratified by ISI (< or ≥14) and infant age (< or ≥8 months). Participants and principal investigators were unblinded. Six-week interventions were delivered via digital materials and telephone. The primary outcome was insomnia symptoms (ISI), assessed pre-, midpoint-, post- (primary endpoint), and one-month post-intervention. Analyses were intention-to-treat using latent growth models. Results. 114 participants (CBT = 39, LDT = 36, TAU = 39; Mage = 32.20 ± 4.62 years) were randomised. There were significantly greater reductions in ISI scores in CBT and LDT (effect sizes −2.01 and −1.52 respectively, p < 0.001) from baseline to post-intervention compared to TAU; improvements were maintained at follow-up. Similar effects were observed for self-reported sleep disturbance. There were greater reductions in fatigue in CBT (effect size = 0.85, p < 0.001) but not LDT (p = 0.11) compared to TAU. Changes in sleepiness, depression, and anxiety were non-significant compared to TAU (all p > 0.08). Four participants (11%) in the LDT group reported headaches, dizziness, or nausea; no others reported adverse events. Conclusions. Therapist-assisted CBT and LDT were feasible during the first postpartum year; data at post-intervention and 1-month follow-up support their safety and efficacy in reducing postpartum insomnia symptoms. © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods Randomized controlled trials of outcomes of TBIs v. face-to-face interventions in psychosis were identified in a systematic search conducted in PubMed/Ovid MEDLINE. Data were extracted independently by two researchers, and standardized mean changes were pooled using a three-level model and network meta-analysis. Results Fifty-eight studies were included. TBIs complementing treatment as usual (TAU) were generally superior to face-to-face interventions (g = 0.16, p ≤ 0.0001) and to specific outcomes, namely, neurocognition (g = 0.13, p ≤ 0.0001), functioning (g = 0.25, p = 0.006), and social cognition (g = 0.32, p ≤ 0.05). Based on the network meta-analysis, the effect of two TBIs differed significantly from zero; these were the TBIs cognitive training for the neurocognitive outcome [g = 0.16; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.23] and cognitive behavioral therapy for quality of life (g = 1.27; 95% CI 0.46-2.08). The variables educational level, type of medication, frequency of the intervention, and contact during the intervention moderated the effectiveness of TBIs over face-to-face interventions in neurocognition and symptomatology. Conclusions TBIs are effective for the management of neurocognition, symptomatology, functioning, social cognition, and quality of life outcomes in patients with psychosis. The results of the network meta-analysis showed the efficacy of some TBIs for neurocognition, symptomatology, and quality of life. Therefore, TBIs should be considered a complement to TAU in patients with psychosis. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Depression remission is often associated with weight gain, a major risk factor for metabolic syndrome (MetS). The primary objective of our study was to assess prospectively the impact of response to antidepressant treatment on developing MetS in a sample of MDD patients with a current major depressive episode (MDE) and who are newly initiating their treatment. Methods In the 6-month prospective METADAP cohort, non-overweight patients, body mass index <25 kg/m2, with MDD and a current MDE were assessed for treatment response after 3 months of treatment, and incidence of MetS after 3 and 6 months of treatment. Outcome variables were MetS, number of MetS criteria, and each MetS criterion (high waist circumference, high blood pressure, high triglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterolemia, and high fasting plasma glucose). Results In total, 98/169 patients (58%) responded to treatment after 3 months. A total of 2.7% (1/38) developed MetS out of which 12.7% (10/79) (p value < 0.001) had responded to treatment after 3 months. The fixed-effect regression models showed that those who responded to treatment after 3 months of follow-up had an 8.6 times higher odds of developing MetS (odds ratio = 8.58, 95% confidence interval 3.89-18.93, p value < 0.001). Conclusion Compared to non-responders, non-overweight patients who responded to treatment after 3 months of antidepressant treatment had a significantly higher risk of developing MetS during the 6 months of treatment. Psychiatrists and nurses should closely monitor the metabolic profile of their patients, especially those who respond to treatment.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

In people with autism, these differences are thought to affect brain structure and function, although the structural and functional bases of these defects are yet to be fully characterized. Methods We applied a comprehensive meta-analysis to resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging datasets from 370 people with autism and 498 non-autistic controls using seven datasets of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange Project. We studied the meta-effect sizes based on standardized mean differences and standard deviations (s.d.) for lateralization of gray matter volume (GMV), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo). We examined the functional correlates of atypical laterality through an indirect annotation approach followed by a direct correlation analysis with symptom scores. Results In people with autism, 85, 51, and 51% of brain regions showed a significant diagnostic effect for lateralization in GMV, fALFF, and ReHo, respectively. Among these regions, 35.7% showed overlapping differences in lateralization in GMV, fALFF, and ReHo, particularly in regions with functional annotations for language, motor, and perceptual functions. These differences were associated with clinical measures of reciprocal social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. A meta-analysis based on s.d. showed that people with autism had lower variability in structural lateralization but higher variability in functional lateralization. Conclusion These findings highlight that atypical hemispheric lateralization is a consistent feature in autism across different sites and may be used as a neurobiological marker for autism.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

This information is essential so that clinical services can provide adequate resources to supporting cognitive functioning. Thus, we investigated this prevalence in individuals in the early course of psychosis or depression. METHODS: A comprehensive cognitive test battery comprising 12 tests was completed by 1286 individuals aged 15-41 (mean age 25.07, s.d. 5.88) from the PRONIA study at baseline: HC (N = 454), clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR; N = 270), recent-onset depression (ROD; N = 267), and recent-onset psychosis (ROP; N = 295). Z-scores were calculated to estimate the prevalence of moderate or severe deficits or strengths (>2 s.d. or 1-2 s.d. below or above HC, respectively) for each cognitive test. RESULTS: Impairment in at least two cognitive tests was as follows: ROP (88.3% moderately, 45.1% severely impaired), CHR (71.2% moderately, 22.4% severely impaired), ROD (61.6% moderately, 16.2% severely impaired). Across clinical groups, impairments were most prevalent in tests of working memory, processing speed, and verbal learning. Above average performance (>1 s.d.) in at least two tests was present for 40.5% ROD, 36.1% CHR, 16.1% ROP, and was >2 SDs in 1.8% ROD, 1.4% CHR, and 0% ROP. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that interventions should be tailored to the individual, with working memory, processing speed, and verbal learning likely to be important transdiagnostic targets.","Article","Scopus"

Recent computational work on decision-making highlights an important role for prospective representations of the imagined outcomes of different choices. This study tested whether internalizing symptoms and trauma exposure among youth impact the generation of prospective reward representations during decision-making and potentially mediate altered behavioral strategies during reward learning. Methods Sixty-one adolescent females with varying exposure to interpersonal violence exposure (n = 31 with histories of physical or sexual assault) and severity of internalizing symptoms completed a social reward learning task during fMRI. Multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) were used to decode neural reward representations at the time of choice. Results MVPA demonstrated that rewarding outcomes could accurately be decoded within several large-scale distributed networks (e.g. frontoparietal and striatum networks), that these reward representations were reactivated prospectively at the time of choice in proportion to the expected probability of receiving reward, and that youth with behavioral strategies that favored exploiting high reward options demonstrated greater prospective generation of reward representations. Youth internalizing symptoms, but not trauma exposure characteristics, were negatively associated with both the behavioral strategy of exploiting high reward options as well as the prospective generation of reward representations in the striatum. Conclusions These data suggest diminished prospective mental simulation of reward as a mechanism of altered reward learning strategies among youth with internalizing symptoms.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

First-episode psychosis (FEP) comprises a group of disorders that show great clinical and long-term outcome heterogeneity, and the extent to which genetic, familial and environmental factors account for predicting the long-term outcome in FEP patients remains scarcely known. Methods The SEGPEPs is an inception cohort study of 243 first-admission patients with FEP who were followed-up for a mean of 20.9 years. FEP patients were thoroughly evaluated by standardized instruments, with 164 patients providing DNA. Aggregate scores estimated in large populations for polygenic risk score (PRS-Sz), exposome risk score (ERS-Sz) and familial load score for schizophrenia (FLS-Sz) were ascertained. Long-term functioning was assessed by means of the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) was used as a standard method to estimate the effect of interaction of risk factors. Results Our results showed that a high FLS-Sz gave greater explanatory capacity for long-term outcome, followed by the ERS-Sz and then the PRS-Sz. The PRS-Sz did not discriminate significantly between recovered and non-recovered FEP patients in the long term. No significant interaction between the PRS-Sz, ERS-Sz or FLS-Sz regarding the long-term functioning of FEP patients was found. Conclusions Our results support an additive model of familial antecedents of schizophrenia, environmental risk factors and polygenic risk factors as contributors to a poor long-term functional outcome for FEP patients.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude is reduced in psychotic disorders and associated with symptoms and functioning. Due to these robust associations, it is often considered a biomarker for psychotic illness. The relationship between MMN and clinical outcomes has been examined well in early onset psychotic illness; however, its stability and predictive utility in chronic samples are not clear. Method. We examined the five-year stability of MMN amplitude over two timepoints in individuals with established psychotic disorders (cases; N = 132) and never-psychotic participants (NP; N = 170), as well as longitudinal associations with clinical symptoms and functioning. Results. MMN amplitude exhibited good temporal stability (cases, r = 0.53; never-psychotic, r = 0.52). In cases, structural equation models revealed MMN amplitude to be a significant predictor of worsening auditory hallucinations (β = 0.19), everyday functioning (β = −0.13), and illness severity (β = −0.12) at follow-up. Meanwhile, initial IQ (β = −0.24), negative symptoms (β = 0.23), and illness severity (β = −0.16) were significant predictors of worsening MMN amplitude five years later. Conclusions. These results imply that MMN measures a neural deficit that is reasonably stable up to five years. Results support disordered cognition and negative symptoms as preceding reduced MMN, which then may operate as a mechanism driving reductions in everyday functioning and the worsening of auditory hallucinations in chronic psychotic disorders. This pattern may inform models of illness course, clarifying the relationships amongst biological mechanisms of predictive processing and clinical deficits in chronic psychosis and allowing us to better understand the mechanisms driving such impairments over time. © The Author(s), 2022.

Little is known about the persistence of self-reported and performance-based cognition with depression and functional outcomes. Methods This is a secondary analysis of a prospective naturalistic observational clinical cohort study of individuals with recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD; N = 623). Participants completed app-based self-reported and performance-based cognitive function assessments alongside validated measures of depression, functional disability, and self-esteem every 3 months. Participants were followed-up for a maximum of 2-years. Multilevel hierarchically nested modelling was employed to explore between- and within-participant variation over time to identify whether persistent cognitive difficulties are related to levels of depression and functional impairment during follow-up. Results 508 individuals (81.5%) provided data (mean age: 46.6, s.d.: 15.6; 76.2% female). Increasing persistence of self-reported cognitive difficulty was associated with higher levels of depression and functional impairment throughout the follow-up. In comparison to low persistence of objective cognitive difficulty (<25% of timepoints), those with high persistence (>75% of timepoints) reported significantly higher levels of depression (B = 5.17, s.e. = 2.21, p = 0.019) and functional impairment (B = 4.82, s.e. = 1.79, p = 0.002) over time. Examination of the individual cognitive modules shows that persistently impaired executive function is associated with worse functioning, and poor processing speed is particularly important for worsened depressive symptoms. Conclusions We replicated previous findings of greater persistence of cognitive difficulty with increasing severity of depression and further demonstrate that these cognitive difficulties are associated with pervasive functional disability. Difficulties with cognition may be an indicator and target for further treatment input. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Irremediability is a key requirement for euthanasia and assisted suicide for psychiatric disorders (psychiatric EAS). Countries like the Netherlands and Belgium ask clinicians to assess irremediability in light of the patient’s diagnosis and prognosis and ‘according to current medical understanding’. Clarifying the relevance of a default objective standard for irremediability when applied to psychiatric EAS is crucial for solid policymaking. Yet so far, a thorough examination of this standard is lacking. Methods. Using treatment-resistant depression (TRD) as a test case, through a scoping review in PubMed, we analyzed the state-of-the-art evidence for whether clinicians can accurately predict individual long-term outcome and single out irremediable cases, by examining the following questions: (1) What is the definition of TRD; (2) What are group-level long-term outcomes of TRD; and (3) Can clinicians make accurate individual outcome predictions in TRD? Results. A uniform definition of TRD is lacking, with over 150 existing definitions, mostly focused on psychopharmacological research. Available yet limited studies about long-term outcomes indicate that a majority of patients with long-term TRD show significant improvement over time. Finally, evidence about individual predictions in TRD using precision medicine is growing, but methodological shortcomings and varying predictive accuracies pose important challenges for its implementation in clinical practice. Conclusion. Our findings support the claim that, as per available evidence, clinicians cannot accurately predict long-term chances of recovery in a particular patient with TRD. This means that the objective standard for irremediability cannot be met, with implications for policy and practice of psychiatric EAS. © The Author(s), 2022.

Emotion processing deficits have been identified as a critical transdiagnostic factor that facilitates distress after trauma exposure. Limited skills in identifying and labelling emotional states (i.e. alexithymia) may present on the more automated (less conscious) end of the spectrum of emotional awareness and clarity. Individuals with alexithymia tend to exhibit a disconcordance between subjective experience and autonomic activity (e.g. where high levels of subjective emotional intensity are associated with low physiological arousal), which may exacerbate distress. Although there is a robust link between alexithymia and trauma exposure, no work to date has explored whether alexithymia is associated with emotional response disconcordance among trauma-exposed adults. Method. Using a validated trauma script paradigm, the present study explored the impact of alexithymia on emotion response concordance [skin conductance (Galvanic Skin Response, GSR) and Total Mood Disturbance (TMD)] among 74 trauma-exposed adults recruited via a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment clinic and student research programme. Results. Unlike posttraumatic symptom severity, age, sex, participant type and mood (which showed no effect on emotion response concordance), alexithymia was associated with heightened emotion response disconcordance between GSR and TMD [F(1, 37) = 8.93, p = 0.006], with low GSR being associated with high TMD. Observed effects of the trauma script were entirely accounted for by the interaction with alexithymia, such that those with alexithymia showed a negligible association between subjective and physiological states. Conclusion. This finding is paramount as it shows that a large proportion of trauma-exposed adults have a divergent emotion engagement profile. © The Author(s), 2022.

Here, we evaluate (1) the extent of variation in SR in patients using a single antipsychotic; (2) the association between subjective and symptomatic response; and (3) predictors of SR. Methods Open-label, single treatment condition with amisulpride in 339 patients with a first episode of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, at most minimally treated before inclusion. Patients were evaluated at baseline, before start with amisulpride and after four weeks of treatment with the Subjective Wellbeing under Neuroleptic scale, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia. Results (1) 26.8% of the patients had a substantial favorable SR, and 12.4% of the patients experienced a substantial dysphoric SR during treatment with amisulpride. (2) Modest positive associations were found between SR and 4 weeks change on symptom subscales (r = 0.268-0.390, p values < 0.001). (3) Baseline affective symptoms contributed to the prediction of subjective remission, demographic characteristics did not. Lower start dosage of amisulpride was associated with a more favorable SR (r = -0.215, p < 0.001). Conclusions We conclude that variation in individual proneness for an unfavorable SR is substantial and only modestly associated with symptomatic response. We need earlier identification of those most at risk for unfavorable SR and research into interventions to improve SR to antipsychotic medication in those at risk. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Adolescence is a key developmental period for the emergence of psychiatric disorders. However, there is still no consensus on the core mechanisms of dysfunction in youth. Neurobiological sensitivity to unpredictable threat has been associated with several psychiatric disorders in adults. The present study examined adolescent defensive motivation (startle reflex) and attention (event-related potentials) in anticipation of unpredictable threat in relation to both adolescent and maternal (i.e. familial risk) internalizing and externalizing spectra. Methods. The sample included 395 15-year-old adolescents and their biological mothers. Adolescent startle potentiation and probe P300 suppression (indicating increased attention to threat) were measured in anticipation of predictable and unpredictable threat. Adolescent and maternal lifetime history of psychiatric disorders were assessed via semi-structured diagnostic interviews, and confirmatory factor analysis was used to model internalizing and externalizing spectra. Results. The adolescent internalizing spectrum was positively associated with adolescent startle potentiation and probe P300 suppression to unpredictable threat. Conversely, the adolescent externalizing spectrum was negatively associated with adolescent P300 suppression to unpredictable threat. The maternal internalizing spectrum was positively associated with adolescent startle potentiation to unpredictable threat and P300 suppression to both predictable and unpredictable threat. The maternal externalizing spectrum was negatively associated with adolescent startle potentiation to unpredictable threat and P300 suppression to both predictable and unpredictable threat. Adolescent and maternal internalizing and externalizing spectra were independently related to adolescent startle potentiation and P300 suppression. Conclusions. Adolescent neurobiological sensitivity to unpredictable threat is associated with both personal history and familial risk for the internalizing and externalizing spectra. © The Author(s), 2022.

Empirical evidence suggests that people use cannabis to ameliorate anxiety and depressive symptoms, yet cannabis also acutely worsens psychosis and affective symptoms. However, the temporal relationship between cannabis use, anxiety and depressive symptoms and psychotic experiences (PE) in longitudinal studies is unclear. This may be informed by examination of mutually mediating roles of cannabis, anxiety and depressive symptoms in the emergence of PE. Methods. Data were derived from the second longitudinal Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study. Mediation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between cannabis use, anxiety/depressive symptoms and PE, using KHB logit in STATA while adjusting for age, sex and education status. Results. Cannabis use was found to mediate the relationship between preceding anxiety, depressive symptoms and later PE incidence, but the indirect contribution of cannabis use was small (for anxiety: % of total effect attributable to cannabis use = 1.00%; for depression: % of total effect attributable to cannabis use = 1.4%). Interestingly, anxiety and depressive symptoms were found to mediate the relationship between preceding cannabis use and later PE incidence to a greater degree (% of total effect attributable to anxiety = 17%; % of total effect attributable to depression = 37%). Conclusion. This first longitudinal cohort study examining the mediational relationship between cannabis use, anxiety/depressive symptoms and PE, shows that there is a bidirectional relationship between cannabis use, anxiety/depressive symptoms and PE. However, the contribution of anxiety/depressive symptoms as a mediator was greater than that of cannabis. © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Little is known about how conspiracy beliefs and health responses are interrelated over time during the course of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. This longitudinal study tested two contrasting, but not mutually exclusive, hypotheses through cross-lagged modeling. First, based on the consequential nature of conspiracy beliefs, we hypothesize that conspiracy beliefs predict an increase in detrimental health responses over time. Second, as people may rationalize their behavior through conspiracy beliefs, we hypothesize that detrimental health responses predict increased conspiracy beliefs over time. Methods. We measured conspiracy beliefs and several health-related responses (i.e. physical distancing, support for lockdown policy, and the perception of the coronavirus as dangerous) at three phases of the pandemic in the Netherlands (N = 4913): During the first lockdown (Wave 1: April 2020), after the first lockdown (Wave 2: June 2020), and during the second lockdown (Wave 3: December 2020). Results. For physical distancing and perceived danger, the overall cross-lagged effects supported both hypotheses, although the standardized effects were larger for the effects of conspiracy beliefs on these health responses than vice versa. The within-person change results only supported an effect of conspiracy beliefs on these health responses, depending on the phase of the pandemic. Furthermore, an overall cross-lagged effect of conspiracy beliefs on reduced support for lockdown policy emerged from Wave 2 to 3. Conclusions. The results provide stronger support for the hypothesis that conspiracy beliefs predict health responses over time than for the hypothesis that health responses predict conspiracy beliefs over time. © The Author(s), 2022.

It is unclear whether the enhancing contact model (ECM) intervention is effective in reducing family caregiving burden and improving hope and quality of life (QOL) among family caregivers of persons with schizophrenia (FCPWS). Methods. We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in FCPWS in eight rural townships in Xinjin, Chengdu, China. In total, 253 FCPWS were randomly allocated to the ECM, psychoeducational family intervention (PFI), or treatment as usual (TAU) group. FCPWS in three groups were assessed caregiving burden, QOL and state of hope at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), 3-month (T2), and 9-month (T3) follow-up, respectively. Results. Compared with participants in the TAU group, participants in the ECM group had statistically significantly lower caregiving burden scores both at T1 and T2 (p = 0.0059 and 0.0257, respectively). Compared with participants in the TAU group, participants in the PFI group had statistically significantly higher QOL scores in T1 (p = 0.0406), while participants in the ECM group had statistically significantly higher QOL scores in T3 (p = 0.0240). Participants in both ECM and PFI groups had statistically significantly higher hope scores than those in the TAU group at T1 (p = 0.0160 and 0.0486, respectively). Conclusions. This is the first study to explore the effectiveness of ECM on reducing family caregiving burden and improving hope and QOL in rural China. The results indicate the ECM intervention, a comprehensive and multifaceted intervention, is more effective than the PFI in various aspects of mental wellbeing among FCPWS.

We explored generational, sex, and socioeconomic inequalities during the first year of the pandemic using nationally representative cohorts from the UK. Methods We analysed data from 26772 participants from five longitudinal cohorts representing generations born between 1946 and 2000, collected in May 2020, September-October 2020, and February-March 2021 across all five cohorts. We used a multilevel growth curve modelling approach to investigate generational, sex, and socioeconomic differences in levels of anxiety and depressive symptomatology, loneliness, and life satisfaction (LS) over time. Results Younger generations had worse levels of mental and social wellbeing throughout the first year of the pandemic. Whereas these generational inequalities narrowed between the first and last observation periods for LS [-0.33 (95% CI -0.51 to -0.15)], they became larger for anxiety [0.22 (0.10, 0.33)]. Generational inequalities in depression and loneliness did not change between the first and last observation periods, but initial depression levels of the youngest cohort were worse than expected if the generational inequalities had not accelerated. Women and those experiencing financial difficulties had worse initial mental and social wellbeing levels than men and those financially living comfortably, respectively, and these gaps did not substantially differ between the first and last observation periods. Conclusions By March 2021, mental and social wellbeing inequalities persisted in the UK adult population. Pre-existing generational inequalities may have been exacerbated with the pandemic onset.

People with severe mental illness (SMI) have more physical health conditions than the general population, resulting in higher rates of hospitalisations and mortality. In this study, we aimed to determine the rate of emergency and planned physical health hospitalisations in those with SMI, compared to matched comparators, and to investigate how these rates differ by SMI diagnosis. Methods. We used Clinical Practice Research DataLink Gold and Aurum databases to identify 20,668 patients in England diagnosed with SMI between January 2000 and March 2016, with linked hospital records in Hospital Episode Statistics. Patients were matched with up to four patients without SMI. Primary outcomes were emergency and planned physical health admissions. Avoidable (ambulatory care sensitive) admissions and emergency admissions for accidents, injuries and substance misuse were secondary outcomes. We performed negative binomial regression, adjusted for clinical and demographic variables, stratified by SMI diagnosis. Results. Emergency physical health (aIRR:2.33; 95% CI 2.22–2.46) and avoidable (aIRR:2.88; 95% CI 2.60–3.19) admissions were higher in patients with SMI than comparators. Emergency admission rates did not differ by SMI diagnosis. Planned physical health admissions were lower in schizophrenia (aIRR:0.80; 95% CI 0.72–0.90) and higher in bipolar disorder (aIRR:1.33; 95% CI 1.24–1.43). Accident, injury and substance misuse emergency admissions were particularly high in the year after SMI diagnosis (aIRR: 6.18; 95% CI 5.46–6.98). Conclusion. We found twice the incidence of emergency physical health admissions in patients with SMI compared to those without SMI. Avoidable admissions were particularly elevated, suggesting interventions in community settings could reduce hospitalisations. Importantly, we found underutilisation of planned inpatient care in patients with schizophrenia. Interventions are required to ensure appropriate healthcare use, and optimal diagnosis and treatment of physical health conditions in people with SMI, to reduce the mortality gap due to physical illness. © The Author(s), 2022.

Prediction of treatment outcomes is a key step in improving the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). The Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND) aims to predict antidepressant treatment outcomes through analyses of clinical assessment, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers. Methods. In the CAN-BIND-1 dataset of 192 adults with MDD and outcomes of treatment with escitalopram, we applied machine learning models in a nested cross-validation framework. Across 210 analyses, we examined combinations of predictive variables from three modalities, measured at baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment, and five machine learning methods with and without feature selection. To optimize the predictors-to-observations ratio, we followed a tiered approach with 134 and 1152 variables in tier 1 and tier 2 respectively. Results. A combination of baseline tier 1 clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular variables predicted response with a mean balanced accuracy of 0.57 (best model mean 0.62) compared to 0.54 (best model mean 0.61) in single modality models. Adding week 2 predictors improved the prediction of response to a mean balanced accuracy of 0.59 (best model mean 0.66). Adding tier 2 features did not improve prediction. Conclusions. A combination of clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular data improves the prediction of treatment outcomes over single modality measurement. The addition of measurements from the early stages of treatment adds precision. Present results are limited by lack of external validation. To achieve clinically meaningful prediction, the multimodal measurement should be scaled up to larger samples and the robustness of prediction tested in an external validation dataset. © The Author(s), 2022.

While studies from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic have described initial negative effects on mental health and exacerbating mental health inequalities, longer-term studies are only now emerging. Method. In total, 34 465 individuals in the UK completed online questionnaires and were recontacted over the first 12 months of the pandemic. We used growth mixture modelling to identify trajectories of depression, anxiety and anhedonia symptoms using the 12-month data. We identified sociodemographic predictors of trajectory class membership using multinomial regression models. Results. Most participants had consistently low symptoms of depression or anxiety over the year of assessments (60%, 69% respectively), and a minority had consistently high symptoms (10%, 15%). We also identified participants who appeared to show improvements in symptoms as the pandemic progressed, and others who showed the opposite pattern, marked symptom worsening, until the second national lockdown. Unexpectedly, most participants showed stable low positive affect, indicating anhedonia, throughout the 12-month period. From regression analyses, younger age, reporting a previous mental health diagnosis, non-binary, or self-defined gender, and an unemployed or a student status were significantly associated with membership of the stable high symptom groups for depression and anxiety. Conclusions. While most participants showed little change in their depression and anxiety symptoms across the first year of the pandemic, we highlight the divergent responses of subgroups of participants, who fared both better and worse around national lockdowns. We confirm that previously identified predictors of negative outcomes in the first months of the pandemic also predict negative outcomes over a 12-month period. © The Author(s), 2022.

However, little is known about their interrelation. The present study follows a network approach to evaluate alterations in cognition-related brain structural networks. Methods Cognitive performance of n = 805 healthy and n = 679 acutely depressed or remitted individuals was assessed using 14 cognitive tests aggregated into cognitive factors. The structural connectome was reconstructed from structural and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Associations between global connectivity strength and cognitive factors were established using linear regressions. Network-based statistics were applied to identify subnetworks of connections underlying these global-level associations. In exploratory analyses, effects of depression were assessed by evaluating remission status-related group differences in subnetwork-specific connectivity. Partial correlations were employed to directly test the complete triad of cognitive factors, depressive symptom severity, and subnetwork-specific connectivity strength. Results All cognitive factors were associated with global connectivity strength. For each cognitive factor, network-based statistics identified a subnetwork of connections, revealing, for example, a subnetwork positively associated with processing speed. Within that subnetwork, acutely depressed patients showed significantly reduced connectivity strength compared to healthy controls. Moreover, connectivity strength in that subnetwork was associated to current depressive symptom severity independent of the previous disease course. Conclusions Our study is the first to identify cognition-related structural brain networks in MDD patients, thereby revealing associations between cognitive deficits, depressive symptoms, and reduced structural connectivity. This supports the hypothesis that structural connectome alterations may mediate the association of cognitive deficits and depression severity.  © The Author(s), 2023.","Article","Scopus"

This study investigates the 6-months follow-up effect of ABM on depressive symptoms in participant with major depressive disorder with and without comorbid disorders. Methods We conducted a double-blind randomized sham-controlled trial in 101 participants between 19 November 2019, and 17 August 2021. Follow-up ended 3 April 2022. Participants were allocated to ABM or sham condition twice daily for 14 consecutive days. Primary outcomes were the total score on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at 6 months, mean Brief State Rumination Inventory (BSRI) score post-treatment and reduction in BSRI post-treatment. Secondary outcome was change in attentional bias (AB). The trial was preregistered in ClinicalTrials.gov (#NCT 04137367). Results A total of 118 patients aged 18-65 years were assessed for eligibility, and 101 were randomized and subjected to intention-to-treat analyses. At 6 months, ABM had no effect on depression and anxiety compared to a sham condition. While rumination decreased during the intervention, there was no effect of condition on rumination and AB. Predictor analysis did not reveal differences between participants with ongoing major depressive episode or comorbid anxiety. Conclusion Compared to sham training, there was no effect of ABM on depressive symptoms at 6-months follow-up. Since the intervention failed at modifying AB, it is unclear whether changes in AB are related to long-term outcomes. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

This randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of a novel transdiagnostic internet-delivered psychological intervention for adults with neurological disorders. Methods 221 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, or an acquired brain injury were allocated to either an immediate treatment group (n = 115) or treatment-as-usual waitlist control (n = 106). The intervention, the Wellbeing Neuro Course, was delivered online via the eCentreClinic website. The Course includes six lessons, based on cognitive behavioural therapy, delivered over 10 weeks with support from a psychologist via email and telephone. Primary outcomes were symptoms of depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7) and disability (WHODAS 2.0). Results 215 participants commenced the trial (treatment n = 111; control n = 104) and were included in intention-to-treat analysis. At post-treatment, we observed significant between-group differences in depression (PHQ-9; difference = 3.07 [95% CI 2.04-4.11], g = 0.62), anxiety (GAD-7; difference = 1.87 [0.92-2.81], g = 0.41) and disability (WHODAS 2.0 difference = 3.08 [1.09-5.06], g = 0.31), that favoured treatment (all ps < 0.001). Treatment-related effects were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Findings were achieved with minimal clinician time (average of 95.7 min [s.d. = 59.3] per participant), highlighting the public health potential of this approach to care. No adverse treatment events were reported.

ERRB patterns may identify individuals at increased risk of future SAs. Methods A representative sample of US Army soldiers entering basic combat training (n = 21 772) was surveyed and followed via administrative records for their first 48 months of service. Latent profile analysis of baseline survey items assessing ERRB dimensions, including emotion reactivity, impulsivity, and risk-taking behaviors, identified distinct response patterns (classes). SAs were identified using administrative medical records. A discrete-time survival framework was used to examine associations of ERRB classes with subsequent SA during the first 48 months of service, adjusting for time in service, socio-demographic and service-related variables, and mental health diagnosis (MH-Dx). We examined whether associations of ERRB classes with SA differed by year of service and for soldiers with and without a MH-Dx. Results Of 21 772 respondents (86.2% male, 61.8% White non-Hispanic), 253 made a SA. Four ERRB classes were identified: 'Indirect Harming' (8.9% of soldiers), 'Impulsive' (19.3%), 'Risk-Taking' (16.3%), and 'Low ERRB' (55.6%). Compared to Low ERRB, Impulsive [OR 1.8 (95% CI 1.3-2.4)] and Risk-Taking [OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.1-2.2)] had higher odds of SA after adjusting for covariates. The ERRB class and MH-Dx interaction was non-significant. Within each class, SA risk varied across service time. Conclusions SA risk within the four identified ERRB classes varied across service time. Impulsive and Risk-Taking soldiers had increased risk of future SA. MH-Dx did not modify these associations, which may therefore help identify risk in those not yet receiving mental healthcare. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This study examined whether clinical improvement to antidepressant medications is associated with pre-randomization functional connectivity in intrinsic brain networks. Methods Participants were 95 elders aged 60 years or older with major depressive disorder. After clinical assessments and baseline MRI, participants were randomized to escitalopram or placebo with a two-to-one allocation for 8 weeks. Non-remitting participants subsequently entered an 8-week trial of open-label bupropion. The main clinical outcome was depression severity measured by MADRS. Resting state functional connectivity was measured between a priori key seeds in the default mode (DMN), cognitive control, and limbic networks. Results In primary analyses of blinded data, lower post-treatment MADRS score was associated with higher resting connectivity between: (a) posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and left medial prefrontal cortex; (b) PCC and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); (c) right medial PFC and subgenual ACC; (d) right orbitofrontal cortex and left hippocampus. Lower post-treatment MADRS was further associated with lower connectivity between: (e) the right orbitofrontal cortex and left amygdala; and (f) left dorsolateral PFC and left dorsal ACC. Secondary analyses associated mood improvement on escitalopram with anterior DMN hub connectivity. Exploratory analyses of the bupropion open-label trial associated improvement with subgenual ACC, frontal, and amygdala connectivity. Conclusions Response to antidepressants in LLD is related to connectivity in the DMN, cognitive control and limbic networks. Future work should focus on clinical markers of network connectivity informing prognosis. Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02332291. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

We estimated the total effect (TE) of unemployment on MH and the controlled direct effect (CDE) not acting via income. Methods We included adults 25-64 years from nine waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (n = 45 497/obs = 202 297). Unemployment was defined as not being in paid employment; common mental disorder (CMD) was defined as General Health Questionnaire-12 score ≥4. We conducted causal mediation analysis using double-robust marginal structural modelling, estimating odds ratios (OR) and absolute differences for effects of unemployment on CMD in the same year, before (TE) and after (CDE) blocking the income pathway. We calculated percentage mediation by income, with bootstrapped standard errors. Results The TE of unemployment on CMD risk was OR 1.66 (95% CI 1.57-1.76), with 7.09% (6.21-7.97) absolute difference in prevalence; equivalent CDEs were OR 1.55 (1.46-1.66) and 6.08% (5.13-7.03). Income mediated 14.22% (8.04-20.40) of the TE. Percentage mediation was higher for job losses [15.10% (6.81-23.39)] than gains [8.77% (0.36-17.19)]; it was lowest for those 25-40 years [7.99% (-2.57 to 18.51)] and in poverty [2.63% (-2.22 to 7.49)]. Conclusions A high proportion of the short-term effect of unemployment on MH is not explained by income, particularly for younger people and those in poverty. Population attributable fractions suggested 16.49% of CMD burden was due to unemployment, with 13.90% directly attributable to job loss rather than resultant income changes. Similar analytical approaches could explore how this differs across contexts, by other factors, and consider longer-term effects. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

However, studies comparing post-awakening cortisol between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls have produced conflicting findings. The aim of this study was to investigate whether this inconsistency could be due to the effects of childhood trauma. Methods A total of N = 112 patients with MDD and healthy controls were divided into four groups according to the presence of childhood trauma. Saliva samples were collected at awakening and 15, 30, 45, and 60 min later. The total cortisol output and the cortisol awakening response (CAR) were calculated. Results The total post-awakening cortisol output was significantly higher in patients with MDD as compared to healthy controls, but only in those individuals reporting childhood trauma. The four groups did not differ regarding the CAR. Conclusions Elevated post-awakening cortisol in MDD may be confined to those with a history of early life stress. Tailoring and/or augmenting of currently available treatments may be required to meet the specific needs of this population. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

The aims of this study were to investigate whether combat injury was associated with deployment-related PTG in a cohort of UK military personnel who were deployed to Afghanistan, and whether post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and pain mediate this relationship. Methods 521 physically injured (n = 138 amputation; n = 383 non-amputation injury) and 514 frequency-matched uninjured personnel completed questionnaires including the deployment-related Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (DPTGI). DPTGI scores were categorised into tertiles of: no/low (score 0-20), moderate (score 21-34) or a large (35-63) degree of deployment-related PTG. Analysis was completed using generalised structural equation modelling. Results A large degree of PTG was reported by 28.0% (n = 140) of the uninjured group, 36.9% (n = 196) of the overall injured group, 45.4% (n = 62) of amputee and 34.1% (n = 134) of the non-amputee injured subgroups. Combat injury had a direct effect on reporting a large degree of PTG [Relative risk ratio (RRR) 1.59 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-2.17)] compared to sustaining no injury. Amputation injuries also had a significant direct effect [RRR 2.18 (95% CI 1.24-3.75)], but non-amputation injuries did not [RRR 1.35 (95% CI 0.92-1.93)]. PTSD, depression and pain partially mediate this relationship, though mediation differed depending on the injury subtype. PTSD had a curvilinear relationship with PTG, whilst depression had a negative association and pain had a positive association. Conclusions Combat injury, in particular injury resulting in traumatic amputation, is associated with reporting a large degree of PTG. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a high-prevalence personality disorder characterized by subtle but stable interpersonal dysfunction. There have been only limited studies addressing the behavioral patterns and cognitive features of OCPD in interpersonal contexts. The purpose of this study was to investigate how behaviors differ between OCPD individuals and healthy controls (HCs) in the context of guilt-related interpersonal responses. Method. A total of 113 participants were recruited, including 46 who were identified as having OCPD and 67 HCs. Guilt-related interpersonal responses were manipulated and measured with two social interactive tasks: the Guilt Aversion Task, to assess how anticipatory guilt motivates cooperation; and the Guilt Compensation Task, to assess how experienced guilt induces compensation behaviors. The guilt aversion model and Fehr–Schmidt inequity aversion model were adopted to analyze decision-making in the Guilt Aversion Task and the Guilt Compensation Task, respectively. Results. Computational model-based results demonstrated that, compared with HCs, the OCPD group exhibited less guilt aversion when making cooperative decisions as well as less guilt-induced compensation after harming others. Conclusion. Our findings indicate that individuals with OCPD tend to be less affected by guilt than HCs. These impairments in guilt-related responses may prevent adjustments in behaviors toward compliance with social norms and thus result in interpersonal dysfunctions. © The Author(s), 2022.

As policymakers invest in efforts to reduce the digital divide, it is important to have robust evidence on whether encouraging Internet use among older adults is beneficial, or potentially detrimental, to their wellbeing. Methods We observe depressive symptoms and loneliness of adults aged 50 + in the nationally representative English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, from before (2018/19) to during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (June/July and November/December 2020). Our quasi-experimental difference-in-differences strategy compares within-individual wellbeing changes between older adults who desired to use the Internet more but experienced barriers including lack of skills, access, and equipment, with regular Internet users who did not desire to use the Internet more. To reduce selection bias, we match both groups on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics that are predictive of Internet use. We assume that in the absence of COVID-19 - a period of increased reliance on the Internet - the wellbeing trajectories of both groups would have followed a common trend. Results Compared with matched controls (N = 2983), participants reporting barriers to Internet use (N = 802) experienced a greater increase in the likelihood of depressive symptoms from before to during the pandemic, but not worse loneliness levels. This effect was stronger for women, those aged above 65 years, and those from lower-income households. Conclusions Besides enabling access to digital services, efforts to ensure older adults continue to be engaged members of an increasingly digital society could deliver returns in terms of a buffer against psychological distress.

Methods The incident rate of antidepressant fills before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared using interrupted time-series analysis followed by comprehensive sensitivity analyses on data derived from electronic medical records from a large health management organization providing nationwide services to 14% of the Israeli population. The dataset covered the period from 1 January 2013 to 1 February 2021, with 1 March 2020 onwards defined as the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Forecasting analysis was implemented to test the effect of the vaccine roll-out and easing of social restrictions on antidepressant use. Results The sample consisted of 852 233 persons with a total antidepressant incident fill count of 139 535.4 (total cumulative rate per 100 000 = 16 372.91, 95% CI 16 287.19-16 459.01). We calculated the proportion of antidepressant prescription fills for the COVID-19 period, and the counterfactual proportion for the same period, assuming COVID-19 had not occurred. The difference in these proportions was significant [Cohen's h = 10-3 (0.16), 95% CI 10-3 (- 0.71 to 1.03)]. The pandemic was associated with a significant increase in the slope of the incident rate of antidepressant fills (slope change = 0.01, 95% CI 0.00-0.03; p = 0.04) and a monthly increase of 2% compared to the counterfactual (the estimated rate assuming no pandemic occurred). The increased rate was more pronounced in women, and was not modified by lockdown on/off periods, socioeconomic or SARS-CoV-2 status. The rate of observed antidepressant fills was similar to that forecasted under the assumption of ongoing COVID-19 distress. Conclusion These findings underscore the toll of the pandemic on mental health and inform mental health policy and service delivery during and after implementing COVID-19 attenuation strategies.

However, the temporal interdependencies between judgments of performance, confidence in accuracy, and feedback about performance are not well understood. Methods We evaluated two tasks: the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Penn Emotion recognition task (ER40). These tasks were modified to include item-by-item confidence and accuracy judgments, along with feedback on accuracy. We evaluated these tasks as time series and applied network modeling to understand the temporal relationships between momentary confidence, accuracy judgments, and feedback. The sample constituted participants with schizophrenia (SZ; N = 144), bipolar disorder (BD; N = 140), and healthy controls (HC; N = 39). Results Network models for both WCST and ER40 revealed denser and lagged connections between confidence and accuracy judgments in SZ and, to a lesser extent in BD, that were not evidenced in HC. However, associations between feedback regarding accuracy with subsequent accuracy judgments and confidence were weaker in SZ and BD. In each of these comparisons, the BD group was intermediate between HC and SZ. In analyses of the WCST, wherein incorporating feedback is crucial for success, higher confidence predicted worse subsequent performance in SZ but not in HC or BD. Conclusions While network models are exploratory, the results suggest some potential mechanisms by which challenges in self-assessment may impede performance, perhaps through hyperfocus on self-generated judgments at the expense of incorporation of feedback.

The transition from military service to civilian life is a high-risk period for suicide attempts (SAs). Although stressful life events (SLEs) faced by transitioning soldiers are thought to be implicated, systematic prospective evidence is lacking. Methods. Participants in the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (STARRS) completed baseline self-report surveys while on active duty in 2011-2014. Two self-report follow-up Longitudinal Surveys (LS1: 2016-2018; LS2: 2018-2019) were subsequently administered to probability subsamples of these baseline respondents. As detailed in a previous report, a SA risk index based on survey, administrative, and geospatial data collected before separation/deactivation identified 15% of the LS respondents who had separated/ deactivated as being high-risk for self-reported post-separation/deactivation SAs. The current report presents an investigation of the extent to which self-reported SLEs occurring in the 12 months before each LS survey might have mediated/modified the association between this SA risk index and post-separation/deactivation SAs. Results. The 15% of respondents identified as high-risk had a significantly elevated prevalence of some post-separation/deactivation SLEs. In addition, the associations of some SLEs with SAs were significantly stronger among predicted high-risk than lower-risk respondents. Demographic rate decomposition showed that 59.5% (S.E. = 10.2) of the overall association between the predicted high-risk index and subsequent SAs was linked to these SLEs. Conclusions. It might be possible to prevent a substantial proportion of post-separation/ deactivation SAs by providing high-risk soldiers with targeted preventive interventions for exposure/vulnerability to commonly occurring SLEs.

This study aimed to examine sociodemographic trends in the prevalence of DEB over 20 years in the Australian general population. Methods Data were derived from five sequential cross-sectional surveys (1998, 2008, 2009, 2016 and 2017) with population-representative samples of adults and adolescents residing in South Australia (N = 15 075). DEBs investigated were objective binge eating (OBE), strict dieting/fasting, and purging. Sociodemographic data included gender, age, educational level, work and marital status, and residence. Results OBE prevalence increased significantly. Strict dieting/fasting also increased from 1998 to 2008/9 but remained stable between 2008/9 and 2016/7. Purging prevalence did not change significantly over time. All survey years were associated with a significantly higher odds of OBE, and strict diet/fasting compared to 1998. Lower age, a higher Accessibility Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) score, higher body mass index (BMI), higher educational attainment, and not being in a married or de facto relationship were independently associated with greater adjusted odds for endorsing OBE. Younger age, female gender, and higher BMI were also independently associated with greater adjusted odds for endorsing strict dieting/fasting. Conclusions The increased prevalence of DEBs in various strata of Australian society has both public health and clinical implications. The results refute the stereotype that eating disorders (EDs) predominantly affect young women. They build impetus for future research on EDs among men and older individuals, with a view to developing tailored public health and clinical interventions for these populations.

This study aimed to examine the association between pharmacological treatment and the risk of ER admissions due to traumatic injuries. Methods Individuals with BPD who received mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotics were identified using a population-based electronic healthcare records database in Hong Kong (2001-2019). A self-controlled case series design was applied to control for time-invariant confounders. Results A total of 5040 out of 14 021 adults with BPD who received pharmacological treatment and had incident ER admissions due to traumatic injuries from 2001 to 2019 were included. An increased risk of traumatic injuries was found 30 days before treatment [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 4.44 (3.71-5.31), p < 0.0001]. After treatment initiation, the risk remained increased with a smaller magnitude, before returning to baseline [IRR 0.97 (0.88-1.06), p = 0.50] during maintenance treatment.

Conclusions This study supports the hypothesis that pharmacological treatment of BPD was associated with a lower risk of ER admissions due to traumatic injuries but an increased risk after treatment cessation. Close monitoring of symptoms relapse is recommended to clinicians and patients if treatment cessation is warranted.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Emerging evidence suggests that interventions designed to target and isolate one key change mechanism may also produce meaningful change in core symptoms. Although both 'broad' and 'focused' digital programs have demonstrated efficacy, no study has performed a direct, head-to-head comparison of the two approaches. We addressed this through a randomized non-inferiority trial. Method Participants with recurrent binge eating were randomly assigned to a broad (n = 199) or focused digital intervention (n = 199), or a waitlist (n = 202). The broad program targeted dietary restraint, mood intolerance, and body image disturbances, while the focused program exclusively targeted dietary restraint. Primary outcomes were eating disorder psychopathology and binge eating frequency. Results In intention-to-treat analyses, both intervention groups reported greater improvements in primary and secondary outcomes than the waitlist, which were sustained at an 8-week follow-up. The focused intervention was not inferior to the broad intervention on all but one outcome, but was associated with higher rates of attrition and non-compliance. Conclusion Focused digital interventions that are designed to target one key change mechanism may produce comparable symptom improvements to broader digital interventions, but appear to be associated with lower engagement.

This non-inferiority RCT evaluated the efficacy of 2-week massed prolonged exposure (MPE) therapy compared to standard 10-week prolonged exposure (SPE), the current gold standard treatment, in reducing PTSD severity in both active serving and veterans in a real-world health service system. Methods This single-blinded multi-site non-inferiority RCT took place in 12 health clinics across Australia. The primary outcome was PTSD symptom severity measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) at 12 weeks. 138 military personnel and veterans with PTSD were randomised. 71 participants were allocated to SPE, with 63 allocated to MPE. Results The intention-to-treat sample included 138 participants, data were analysed for 134 participants (88.1% male, M = 46 years). The difference between the mean MPE and SPE group PTSD scores from baseline to 12 weeks-post therapy was 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI) -4.19 to +6.07]. The upper endpoint of the 95% CI was below +7, indicating MPE was non-inferior to SPE. Significant rates of loss of PTSD diagnosis were found for both groups (MPE 53.8%, SPE 54.1%). Dropout rates were 4.8% (MPE) and 16.9% (SPE). Conclusions MPE was non-inferior to SPE in significantly reducing symptoms of PTSD. Significant reductions in symptom severity, low dropout rates, and loss of diagnosis indicate MPE is a feasible, accessible, and effective treatment. Findings demonstrate novel methods to deliver gold-standard treatments for PTSD should be routinely considered.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

However, few studies have examined stress longitudinally, limiting understanding of how within-person fluctuations in stress influence EE over time and whether stress is a risk factor or consequence of EE. Additionally, little is known regarding how the biological stress response relates to EE. Methods We used an intensive, longitudinal design to examine between-person and within-person effects of major life stress, daily stress, and cortisol on EE in a population-based sample of women (N = 477; ages 15-30; M = 21.8; s.d. = 3.0) from the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Participants reported past year major life stress, then provided daily ratings of EE and stress for 49 consecutive days. Hair cortisol concentration (HCC) was collected as a longitudinal biological stress measure. Results Women reported greater EE when they experienced greater mean stress across days (between-person effects) or greater stress relative to their own average on a given day (within-person effects). Daily stress was more strongly associated with EE than major life stress. However, the impact of daily stress on EE was amplified in women with greater past year major life stress. Finally, participants with lower HCC had increased EE. Conclusions Findings confirm longitudinal associations between stress and EE in women, and highlight the importance of within-person shifts in stress in EE risk. Results also highlight HCC as a novel biological stress measure that is significantly associated with EE and may overcome limitations of prior physiological stress response indicators.

Here we test whether such reward sensitivity deficits are dependent on the overall value of the decision problem. Methods We used a two-armed bandit task with two different contexts: one 'rich', one 'poor' where both options were associated with an overall positive, negative expected value, respectively. We tested patients (N = 30) undergoing a major depressive episode and age, gender and socio-economically matched controls (N = 26). Learning performance followed by a transfer phase, without feedback, were analyzed to distangle between a decision or a value-update process mechanism. Finally, we used computational model simulation and fitting to link behavioral patterns to learning biases. Results Control subjects showed similar learning performance in the 'rich' and the 'poor' contexts, while patients displayed reduced learning in the 'poor' context. Analysis of the transfer phase showed that the context-dependent impairment in patients generalized, suggesting that the effect of depression has to be traced to the outcome encoding. Computational model-based results showed that patients displayed a higher learning rate for negative compared to positive outcomes (the opposite was true in controls). Conclusions Our results illustrate that reinforcement learning performances in depression depend on the value of the context. We show that depressive patients have a specific trouble in contexts with an overall negative state value, which in our task is consistent with a negativity bias at the learning rates level.

We have previously shown that post-success and post-error cognitive controls are associated with distinct mechanisms particularly related to the prefrontal-cerebellar circuit, raising the possibility that altered dynamic interactions in this circuit may underlie mental illness. Methods This study included 136 patients with three diagnosed disorders [48 schizophrenia (SZ), 49 bipolar disorder (BD), 39 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)] and 89 healthy controls who completed a stop-signal task during fMRI scans. Brain activations for concurrent, post-success, and post-error cognitive controls were analyzed and compared between groups. Dynamic causal modeling was applied to investigate prefrontal-cerebellar effective connectivity patterns during post-success and post-error processing. Results No significant group differences were observed for brain activations and overall effective connectivity structures during post-success and post-error conditions. However, significant group differences were shown for the modulational effect on top-down connectivity from the prefrontal cortex to the cerebellum during post-error trials (pFWE = 0.02), which was driven by reduced modulations in both SZ and ADHD. During post-success trials, there were significantly decreased modulational effect on bottom-up connectivity from the cerebellum to the prefrontal cortex in ADHD (pFWE = 0.04) and decreased driving input to the cerebellum in SZ (pFWE = 0.04). Conclusions These findings suggest that patients with SZ and ADHD are associated with insufficient neural modulation on the prefrontal-cerebellar circuit during post-success and post-error cognitive processing, a phenomenon that may underlie cognitive deficits in these disorders.

The purposes of this prospective study were to predict incident chronic diseases based on baseline depressive symptoms and to test sex-dependent effects. Methods In a representative German community sample of over 12 000 participants, baseline depressive symptoms (assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) were tested as a predictor of new onset of cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes, cancer, and migraine at 5-year follow-up. To study disease incidence, we created subsamples for each chronic disease by excluding participants who already had the respective disease at baseline. Potential confounders were included in logistic regression models and sex-specific analyses were performed. Results Controlling for demographic characteristics and loneliness, in men and women, baseline depressive symptoms were predictive of CVD, chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes, and migraine, but not of cancer. When we additionally adjusted for metabolic and lifestyle risk factors, there was an 8% increase of chronic obstructive lung disease and migraine per point of depressive symptoms. There was a trend for CVD (4%; p = 0.053). Sex-sensitive analyses revealed trends for the relevance of depressive symptoms for CVD in men (p = 0.065), and for diabetes in women (p = 0.077). Conclusions These findings underscore the need to implement screening for depression in the treatment of major somatic illnesses. At the same time, depressed patients should be screened for metabolic and lifestyle risk factors and for somatic diseases and offered lifestyle interventions.

Influential theoretical models specify family stress and child characteristics as mediating this effect. These accounts, however, have often been based on cross-sectional data or longitudinal analyses that do not capture all potential pathways, and therefore may not provide good policy guidance. Methods In a UK representative sample of 2399 children aged 5-15, we tested mediation of the effect of household income on parent and teacher reports of conduct problems (CP) via unhealthy family functioning, poor parental mental health, stressful life events, child physical health and reading ability. We applied cross-lagged longitudinal mediation models which allowed for testing of reciprocal effects whereby the hypothesised mediators were modelled as outcomes as well as predictors of CP. Results We found the predicted significant longitudinal effect of income on CP, but no evidence that it was mediated by the child and family factors included in the study. Instead, we found significant indirect paths from income to parental mental health, child physical health and stressful life events that were transmitted via child CP. Conclusion The results confirm that income is associated with change in CP but do not support models that suggest this effect is transmitted via unhealthy family functioning, parental mental health, child physical health, stressful life events or reading difficulties. Instead, the results highlight that child CP may be a mediator of social inequalities in family psychosocial functioning.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

It remains unclear how SSRIs and other antidepressants are associated with the risk of repeated suicide attempts. We aimed to analyse the association between redeemed antidepressant prescriptions and the risk of repeated suicide attempts, hypothesising that antidepressant treatment is associated with increased risk of repeated suicide attempts. Methods. The study was based on Danish register data and a validated cohort of 1842 suicide attempts. We used three Cox regression models (crude, adjusted and propensity score matched) to analyse the data; these models included both static and dynamic time-dependent factors. Results. 1842 individuals attempted suicide in the study period, with a total of 210 repeated attempts. Individuals redeeming antidepressant prescriptions were more likely to repeat a suicide attempt. All crude models showed all antidepressants to be significant risk factors (HR around 1.39), whereas all adjusted models showed all antidepressants to be insignificant risk factors. Conclusion. We found no significant increased risk of repeated suicide attempts in individuals redeeming a prescription for any antidepressant (or only SSRIs) when considering the individuals’ baseline risk of repetition. This study is based on validated suicide attempts, register data, and strong epidemiology designs, but it still has some limitations, and the results should be replicated and confirmed in other studies. © The Author(s), 2022.

We conducted two exploratory studies to examine trauma types' associations with MIE and MID among civilian medical patients (Study 1) and explore how these facets may indirectly affect the relationship between trauma type and hfHRV among civilians seeking mental health services (Study 2). Methods Participants recruited from a public hospital and/or community advertisements (Study 1, n = 72, 87.5% Black, 83.3% women; Study 2, n = 46, 71.7% Black, 97.8% women) completed measures assessing trauma type, MIE, and MID. In Study 1, trauma types that emerged as significant correlates of MIE and MID were entered into separate linear regression analyses. Trauma types identified were included as predictors in indirect effects models with MIE or MID as the mediator and resting hfHRV (assayed via electrocardiography) as the outcome. Results Childhood sexual abuse emerged as the only significant predictor of MIE, b = 0.38, p < 0.001; childhood sexual abuse, b = 0.26, p < 0.05, and adulthood sexual assault, b = 0.23, p < 0.05 were significant predictors of MID. Participants with greater MIE and MID demonstrated lower hfHRV. Adulthood sexual assault showed an indirect effect on hfHRV through MID, B = -0.10, s.e. = 0.06, 95%CI (-0.232 to -0.005). Conclusions Moral injury was uniquely associated with sexual violence and lower hfHRV in civilians. Data highlight moral injury as a pathway through which autonomic dysregulation may emerge and its salience for trauma treatment selection.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

In late childhood and late adolescence children's internalizing disorders were diagnosed. At early adolescence maternal and child's hair cortisol concentrations (HCC), maternal sensitivity, and mothers' post-traumatic symptoms evaluated. Results War-exposed children exhibited more internalizing disorders of chronic trajectory and mothers were less sensitive and more symptomatic. Three pathways elucidated the continuity of psychopathology: (a) maternal sensitivity moderated the risk of chronic psychopathology, (b) maternal post-traumatic symptoms mediated continuity of risk, (c) trauma exposure moderated the association between child internalizing disorders at late childhood and maternal HCC, which linked with child HCC. Child HCC linked with maternal post-traumatic symptoms, which were associated with child disorders in late adolescence. Conclusion Results demonstrate the complex interplay of maternal and child's biosocial factors as mediators and moderators of risk chronicity across the adolescent transition following trauma. Findings are first to utilize maternal and child's HCC as biomarkers of chronic stress v. resilience during adolescence, a period of neural reorganization and personal growth that shapes the individual's lifetime adaptation.

While compensatory network reorganization is a unique developmental characteristic that may restore several brain disorders, its association with methamphetamine (MA) use-induced damage during adolescence is unclear. Methods Using independent component (IC) analysis on structural magnetic resonance imaging data, spatially ICs described as morphometric networks were extracted to examine the effects of MA use on gray matter (GM) volumes and network module connectivity in adolescents (51 MA users v. 60 controls) and adults (54 MA users v. 60 controls). Results MA use was related to significant GM volume reductions in the default mode, cognitive control, salience, limbic, sensory and visual network modules in adolescents. GM volumes were also reduced in the limbic and visual network modules of the adult MA group as compared to the adult control group. Differential patterns of structural connectivity between the basal ganglia (BG) and network modules were found between the adolescent and adult MA groups. Specifically, adult MA users exhibited significantly reduced connectivity of the BG with the default network modules compared to control adults, while adolescent MA users, despite the greater extent of network GM volume reductions, did not show alterations in network connectivity relative to control adolescents. Conclusions Our findings suggest the potential of compensatory network reorganization in adolescent brains in response to MA use. The developmental characteristic to compensate for MA-induced brain damage can be considered as an age-specific therapeutic target for adolescent MA users.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

However, it is not known whether effective treatment of depression through psychological therapies is associated with reduced dementia incidence. The aim of this study was to investigate associations between reduction in depressive symptoms following psychological therapy and the subsequent incidence of dementia. Methods National psychological therapy data were linked with hospital records of dementia diagnosis for 119808 people aged 65+. Participants received a course of psychological therapy treatment in Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services between 2012 and 2019. Cox proportional hazards models were run to test associations between improvement in depression following psychological therapy and incidence of dementia diagnosis up to eight years later. Results Improvements in depression following treatment were associated with reduced rates of dementia diagnosis up to 8 years later (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83-0.94), after adjustment for key covariates. Strongest effects were observed for vascular dementia (HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.97) compared with Alzheimer's disease (HR = 0.91, 95% CI 0.83-1.00). Conclusions Reliable improvement in depression across psychological therapy was associated with reduced incidence of future dementia. Results are consistent with at least two possibilities. Firstly, psychological interventions to improve symptoms of depression may have the potential to contribute to dementia risk reduction efforts. Secondly, psychological therapies may be less effective in people with underlying dementia pathology or they may be more likely to drop out of therapy (reverse causality). Tackling the under-representation of older people in psychological therapies and optimizing therapy outcomes is an important goal for future research. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This could have important public health implications. This study aimed to explore longitudinal patterns of 'home confinement' (defined as not leaving the house/garden) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated predictors and mental health outcomes. Methods Data were from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 25 390 adults in England who were followed up for 17 months (March 2020-July 2021). Data were analysed using growth mixture models. Results Our analyses identified three classes of growth trajectories, including one class showing a high level of persistent home confinement (the home-confined, 24.8%), one changing class with clear alignment with national containment measures (the adaptive, 32.0%), and one class with a persistently low level of confinement (the unconfined, 43.1%). A range of factors were associated with the class membership of home-confinement trajectories, such as age, gender, income, employment status, social relationships and health. The home-confined class had the highest number of depressive (diff = 1.34-1.68, p < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (diff = 0.84-1.05, p < 0.001) at the end of the follow-up than the other two classes. Conclusions There was substantial heterogeneity in longitudinal patterns of home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. People with a persistent high level of confinement had the worst mental health outcomes, calling for special attention in mental health action plans, in particular targeted interventions for at-risk groups.

Many are broadly described as childhood adversity; modelling the combined impact of these is complex. We aimed to develop and validate a scale on childhood adversity, independent of genetic and other environmental liabilities, for use in schizophrenia risk analysis models, using data from cross-linked electronic health and social services registers. Method A cohort of N = 428 970 Western Australian children born 1980-2001 was partitioned into three samples: scale development sample (N = 171 588), and two scale validation samples (each N = 128 691). Measures of adversity were defined before a child's 10th birthday from five domains: discontinuity in parenting, family functioning, family structure, area-level socioeconomic/demographic environment and family-level sociodemographic status. Using Cox proportional hazards modelling of follow-up time from 10th birthday to schizophrenia diagnosis or censorship, weighted combinations of measures were firstly developed into scales for each domain, then combined into a final global scale. Discrimination and calibration performance were validated using Harrell's C and graphical assessment respectively. Results A weighted combination of 42 measures of childhood adversity was derived from the development sample. Independent application to identical measures in validation samples produced Harrell's Concordance statistics of 0.656 and 0.624. Average predicted time to diagnosis curves corresponded with 95% CI limits of observed Kaplan-Meier curves in five prognostic categories. Conclusions Our Early Adversity Scale for Schizophrenia (EAS-Sz), the first using routinely collected register data, predicts schizophrenia diagnosis above chance, and has potential to help untangle contributions of genetic and environmental liability to schizophrenia risk.

Methods Fifty schizophrenia patients and 43 healthy controls completed behavioural assessments for sensory integration and underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for measuring the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) glutamate levels. The correlation between glutamate levels and behavioural sensory integration deficits was examined in each group. A subsample of 20 pairs of patients and controls further completed an audiovisual sensory integration functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task. Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activation and task-dependent functional connectivity (FC) were assessed based on fMRI data. Full factorial analyses were performed to examine the Group-by-Glutamate Level interaction effects on fMRI measurements (group differences in correlation between glutamate levels and fMRI measurements) and the correlation between glutamate levels and fMRI measurements within each group. Results We found that schizophrenia patients exhibited impaired sensory integration which was positively correlated with ACC glutamate levels. Multimodal analyses showed significantly Group-by-Glutamate Level interaction effects on BOLD activation as well as task-dependent FC in a 'cortico-subcortical-cortical' network (including medial frontal gyrus, precuneus, ACC, middle cingulate gyrus, thalamus and caudate) with positive correlations in patients and negative in controls. Conclusions Our findings indicate that ACC glutamate influences neural activities in a large-scale network during sensory integration, but the effects have opposite directionality between schizophrenia patients and healthy people. This implicates the crucial role of glutamatergic system in sensory integration processing in schizophrenia.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trends in suicide attempts and suicide deaths in New Taipei City, Taiwan. Methods The current study used the official daily data on suicide attempts and deaths in New Taipei City, Taiwan (4 million inhabitants) between 2015 and 2020 from the Taiwan National Suicide Prevention Reporting System. Interrupted time-series (ITS) analyses with parameters corrected by the estimated autocorrelations were applied on weekly aggregated data to examine whether the suicide trends during the early COVID-19 pandemic (late January to July 2020) deviated from previous trends (January 2015 to late January 2020). The impact due to the suicide prevention policy change was also examined (since August 2020). Results ITS analyses revealed no significant increases in both mean and trend on weekly suicide deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and after the policy change. In contrast, there was a significant increasing trend in weekly suicide attempts since the COVID-19 outbreak at the rate of 1.54 attempts per week (95% confidence interval 0.49-2.60; p = 0.004). Sex difference analysis revealed that, however, this increasing trend was observed only in females not in males. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has different impacts on suicides attempts and deaths during the early pandemic in New Taipei City, Taiwan. The COVID-19 outbreak drastically increased the trend of suicide attempts. In contrast, the number of suicide deaths had remained constant in the investigated periods.

BPD is likely underdiagnosed, in part, because patients with BPD usually present with chief complaints associated with mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. When patients with BPD do not exhibit self-harm behavior, we suspect that BPD is less likely to recognized. An important question is whether the absence of this criterion, which might attenuate the likelihood of recognizing and diagnosing the disorder, identifies a subgroup of patients with BPD who are 'less borderline' than patients with BPD who do not manifest this criterion. Methods Psychiatric outpatients were evaluated with a semi-structured diagnostic interview for DSM-IV BPD, 390 of whom were diagnosed with BPD. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with BPD who do and do not engage in repeated suicidal and self-harm behavior. Results Approximately half of the patients with BPD did not meet the suicidality/self-injury diagnostic criterion for the disorder. There were no differences between the patients who did and did not meet this criterion in occupational impairment, likelihood of receiving disability payments, impairment in social functioning, level of educational achievement, comorbid psychiatric disorders, history of childhood trauma, or severity of depression, anxiety, or anger upon presentation for treatment. Conclusions Repeated self-injurious and suicidal behavior is not synonymous with BPD. It is critical for clinicians to be aware that the absence of repeated self-injury and suicide threats/gestures or attempts does not rule out the diagnosis of BPD.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Co-occurring psychiatric disorders are common in autism, with previous studies suggesting 54–94% of autistic individuals develop a mental health condition in their lifetime. Most studies have looked at clinically-recruited cohorts, or paediatric cohorts followed into adulthood, with less known about the autistic community at a population level. We therefore studied the prevalence of co-occurring psychiatric and neurological conditions in autistic individuals in a national sample. Methods. This retrospective case-control study utilised the SAIL Databank to examine anonymised whole population electronic health record data from 2001 to 2016 in Wales, UK (N = 3.6 million). We investigated the prevalence of co-occurring psychiatric and selected neurological diagnoses in autistic adults’ records during the study period using International Classification of Diseases-10 and Read v2 clinical codes compared to general population controls matched for age, sex and deprivation Results. All psychiatric conditions examined were more common amongst adults with autism after adjusting for age, sex and deprivation. Prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (7.00%), bipolar disorder (2.50%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (3.02%), psychosis (18.30%) and schizophrenia (5.20%) were markedly elevated in those with autism, with corresponding odds ratios 8.24–10.74 times the general population. Depression (25.90%) and anxiety (22.40%) were also more prevalent, with epilepsy 9.21 times more common in autism. Conclusions. We found that a range of psychiatric conditions were more frequently recorded in autistic individuals. We add to understanding of under-reporting and diagnostic overshadowing in autism. With increasing awareness of autism, services should be cognisant of the psychiatric conditions that frequently co-occur in this population. © The Author(s), 2022.

We examined the relationship between maternal suicide attempt and risk of hospitalization for potentially preventable conditions in offspring. Methods We analyzed a longitudinal cohort of 1 032 210 children born in Quebec, Canada between 2006 and 2019. The main exposure measure was maternal suicide attempt before or during pregnancy. Outcomes included child hospitalizations for potentially preventable conditions, including infectious diseases, dental caries, atopy, and injury up to 14 years after birth. We used adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of maternal suicide attempt with risk of hospitalization for these outcomes. Results Compared with no suicide attempt, children whose mothers attempted suicide had an increased risk of hospitalization for infectious diseases (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.16), dental caries (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.15-1.48), and injury (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.03-1.31). Risk of hospitalization for any of these outcomes was greater if mothers attempted suicide by hanging (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.22-1.75), had their first attempt between the age of 25 and 34 years (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.42), and had 3 or more attempts (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.27-1.91). Maternal suicide attempts were more strongly associated with child hospitalization before 10 years of age.

The stress sensitization hypothesis posits experiences of adversity sensitize individuals to stress reactions which can lead to greater psychiatric problems. We extend this hypothesis by exploring how multiple adversities such as early childhood adversity, combat-related trauma, and military sexual trauma related to heterogeneity in stress over time and, subsequently, greater risk for PTSD. Methods 1230 veterans were recruited for an observational, longitudinal study. Veterans responded to questionnaires on PTSD, stress, and traumatic experiences five times over an 18-month study period. We used latent transition analysis to understand how heterogeneity in adverse experiences is related to transition into stress trajectory classes. We also explored how transition patterns related to PTSD symptomology. Results Across all models, we found support for stress sensitization. In general, combat trauma in combinations with other types of adverse experiences, namely early childhood adversity and military sexual trauma, imposed a greater probability of transitioning into higher risk stress profiles. We also showed differential effects of early childhood and military-specific adversity on PTSD symptomology. Conclusion The present study rigorously integrates both military-specific and early life adversity into analysis on stress sensitivity, and is the first to examine how sensitivity might affect trajectories of stress over time. Our study provides a nuanced, and specific, look at who is risk for sensitization to stress based on previous traumatic experiences as well as what transition patterns are associated with greater PTSD symptomology.

The current study examined whether performance on a Go/No-go (GNG) task, and computational modeling to extract latent cognitive variables, could enhance prediction of suicide attempts within next 90 days, among individuals at high-risk for suicide. Method 136 Veterans at high-risk for suicide previously completed a computer-based GNG task requiring rapid responding (Go) to target stimuli, while withholding responses (No-go) to infrequent foil stimuli; behavioral variables included false alarms to foils (failure to inhibit) and missed responses to targets. We conducted a secondary analysis of these data, with outcomes defined as actual suicide attempt (ASA), other suicide-related event (OtherSE) such as interrupted/aborted attempt or preparatory behavior, or neither (noSE), within 90-days after GNG testing, to examine whether GNG variables could improve ASA prediction over standard clinical variables. A computational model (linear ballistic accumulator, LBA) was also applied, to elucidate cognitive mechanisms underlying group differences. Results On GNG, increased miss rate selectively predicted ASA, while increased false alarm rate predicted OtherSE (without ASA) within the 90-day follow-up window. In LBA modeling, ASA (but not OtherSE) was associated with decreases in decisional efficiency to targets, suggesting differences in the evidence accumulation process were specifically associated with upcoming ASA. Conclusions These findings suggest that GNG may improve prediction of near-term suicide risk, with distinct behavioral patterns in those who will attempt suicide within the next 90 days. Computational modeling suggests qualitative differences in cognition in individuals at near-term risk of suicide attempt.  © US Dept of Veteran Affairs, 2022.","Article","Scopus"

Here, we asked whether a technology-enhanced approach to relapse prevention could reduce days spent in a hospital after discharge. Methods The Improving Care and Reducing Cost (ICRC) study was a quasi-experimental clinical trial in outpatients with schizophrenia conducted between 26 February 2013 and 17 April 2015 at 10 different sites in the USA in an outpatient setting. Patients were between 18 and 60 years old with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. Patients received usual care or a technology-enhanced relapse prevention program during a 6-month period after discharge. The health technology program included in-person, individualized relapse prevention planning with treatments delivered via smartphones and computers, as well as a web-based prescriber decision support program. The main outcome measure was days spent in a psychiatric hospital during 6 months after discharge. Results The study included 462 patients, of which 438 had complete baseline data and were thus used for propensity matching and analysis. Control participants (N = 89; 37 females) were enrolled first and received usual care for relapse prevention followed by 349 participants (128 females) who received technology-enhanced relapse prevention. During 6-month follow-up, 43% of control and 24% of intervention participants were hospitalized (χ2 = 11.76, p<0.001). Days of hospitalization were reduced by 5 days (mean days: b = -4.58, 95% CI -9.03 to -0.13, p = 0.044) in the intervention condition compared to control. Conclusions These results suggest that technology-enhanced relapse prevention is an effective and feasible way to reduce rehospitalization days among patients with schizophrenia.

Given the symptom cyclicity of PMDD, ambulatory assessment is ideally suited to capture psychological and physiological processes across the menstrual cycle. Our study examines habitual ER-strategies in women with PMDD and their predictive value for the course of mood and basal cortisol across the cycle in affected women. Methods Women with and without PMDD (n = 61 each) were compared regarding habitual mindfulness, reappraisal, and repetitive negative thinking (RNT). Momentary affect and cortisol output were assessed over two consecutive days per cycle phase (menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, late luteal). Results Women with PMDD reported lower mindfulness, less use of reappraisal and stronger RNT than controls (ps < 0.035). In women with PMDD, higher mindfulness and reappraisal and lower RNT predicted decreased negative and increased positive affect across the menstrual cycle (ps < 0.027). However, women using more favorable ER-strategies displayed stronger mood cyclicity, resulting in stronger mood deterioration in the late luteal phase, thereby resembling women with more unfavorable ER-strategies toward the end of the cycle. Lower mindfulness predicted lower cortisol in the menstrual phase. Conclusions Protective ER-strategies seem to be generally linked to better momentary mood in women with PMDD, but do not appear to protect affected women from premenstrual mood deterioration. Habitual mindfulness, in turn, seems to buffer blunted cortisol activity in women with PMDD, especially in the menstrual phase. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Childhood adversity is a well-established risk factor for PEs. The aim of this study was to investigate (1) the relationship between childhood adversity and recurring PEs in adolescence and (2) candidate mediators of that relationship. Methods We used data from Cohort '98 of the Growing Up in Ireland study (n = 6039) at three time points (ages 9, 13 and 17) to investigate the relationship between childhood adversity (parent-reported at age 9), recurring PEs (measured using a subset of the Adolescent Psychotic-like Symptoms Screener at ages 13 and 17). The mediating roles of parent-child relationship, internalising and externalising difficulties, self-concept, physical activity, dietary quality, perceived neighbourhood safety and friendship quantity were investigated using the KHB path decomposition method. Results Childhood adversity was associated with an increased risk of recurring PEs with a population attributable fraction of 23%. Internalising difficulties and self-concept explained 13% of the relationship between childhood adversity and PEs suggesting a partial mediation. A significant direct effect remained between childhood adversity and recurring PEs. Conclusions The established relationship between childhood adversity and PEs may be mainly driven by the relationship between childhood adversity and recurring PEs. Internalising difficulties and self-concept together mediate part of the relationship between childhood adversity and recurring PEs.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Finally, participants were split into two groups (below and above clinical threshold ASTs Groups) and multi-group invariance testing was conducted on the data to identify the moderating effect of ASTs on the relationship between hyperactive/inattentive traits and outcomes (i.e. conduct and emotional problems). Results Hyperactive/inattentive traits were associated with higher rates of conduct and emotional problems for both boys and girls. The presence of ASTs moderated these relationships for boys, but not for girls, by increasing the risk of boys with hyperactive/inattentive traits developing greater conduct and emotional problems.

Effective interventions to prevent the emergence of mental health problems are needed. In the current study we assessed the efficacy of the cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-informed Climate Schools universal eHealth preventive mental health programme, relative to a control. We also explored whether the intervention had differential effects on students with varying degrees of social connectedness. Method We evaluated the efficacy of the Climate Schools mental health programme (19 participating schools; average age at baseline was 13.6) v. a control group (18 participating schools; average age at baseline was 13.5) which formed part of a large cluster randomised controlled trial in Australian schools. Measures of internalising problems, depression and anxiety were collected at baseline, immediately following the intervention and at 6-, 12- and 18-months post intervention. Immediately following the intervention, 2539 students provided data on at least one outcome of interest (2065 students at 18 months post intervention). Results Compared to controls, we found evidence that the standalone mental health intervention improved knowledge of mental health, however there was no evidence that the intervention improved other mental health outcomes, relative to a control. Student's social connectedness did not influence intervention outcomes. Conclusion These results are consistent with recent findings that universal school-based, CBT-informed, preventive interventions for mental health have limited efficacy in improving symptoms of anxiety and depression when delivered alone.

Enriched family environments and corresponding brain development may reduce the risk of their onset, but research investigating white matter neurodevelopmental pathways explaining associations between the family environment and behavior remains limited. We hypothesized that more positive prenatal and mid-childhood family functioning - a measure of a family's problem solving and supportive capacity - would be associated with two markers of preadolescent white matter neurodevelopment related to reduced behavior problems: higher global fractional anisotropy (FA) and lower global mean diffusivity (MD). Methods Data are from 2727 families in the Generation R Study, the Netherlands. Mothers reported family functioning (McMaster Family Assessment Device, range 1-4, higher scores indicate healthier functioning) prenatally and in mid-childhood (mean age 6.1 years). In preadolescence (mean age 10.1), the study collected diffusion-weighted scans. We computed standardized global MD and FA values by averaging metrics from 27 white matter tracts, and we fit linear models adjusting for possible confounders to examine global and tract-specific outcomes. Results Prenatal and mid-childhood family functioning scores were moderately correlated, r = 0.38. However, only prenatal family functioning - and not mid-childhood functioning - was associated with higher global FA and lower global MD in preadolescence in fully adjusted models: βglobal FA = 0.11 (95% CI 0.00, 0.21) and βglobal MD = -0.15 (95% CI -0.28, -0.03) per one-unit increase in functioning score. Sensitivity and tract-specific analyses supported these global findings.

Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an opportunity to examine APP using real-world data. In this study, we use EHR data to identify periods when patients were prescribed 2 + antipsychotics and compare these with periods of antipsychotic monotherapy. To determine the relationship between APP and subsequent instances of ADRs: QT interval prolongation, hyperprolactinaemia, and increased body weight [body mass index (BMI) >25]. Methods We extracted anonymised EHR data. Patients aged 16 + receiving antipsychotic medication at Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2018 were included. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to elucidate the relationship between APP and the subsequent presence of QT interval prolongation, hyperprolactinaemia, and/or increased BMI following a period of APP within 7, 30, or 180 days respectively. Results We identified 35 409 observations of antipsychotic prescribing among 13 391 patients. Compared with antipsychotic monotherapy, APP was associated with a subsequent increased risk of hyperprolactinaemia (adjusted odds ratio 2.46; 95% CI 1.87-3.24) and of registering a BMI > 25 (adjusted odds ratio 1.75; 95% CI 1.33-2.31) in the period following the APP prescribing. Conclusions Our observations suggest that APP should be carefully managed with attention to hyperprolactinaemia and obesity.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Take up in routine services is limited by the need for up to 14 ninety-min face-to-face sessions, some of which are out of the office. An internet-based version of the treatment (iCT-SAD) with remote therapist support may achieve similar outcomes with less therapist time. Methods 102 patients with social anxiety disorder were randomised to iCT-SAD, CT-SAD, or waitlist (WAIT) control, each for 14 weeks. WAIT patients were randomised to the treatments after wait. Assessments were at pre-treatment/wait, midtreatment/wait, posttreatment/wait, and follow-ups 3 & 12 months after treatment. The pre-registered (ISRCTN 95 458 747) primary outcome was the social anxiety disorder composite, which combines 6 independent assessor and patient self-report scales of social anxiety. Secondary outcomes included disability, general anxiety, depression and a behaviour test. Results CT-SAD and iCT-SAD were both superior to WAIT on all measures. iCT-SAD did not differ from CT-SAD on the primary outcome at post-treatment or follow-up. Total therapist time in iCT-SAD was 6.45 h. CT-SAD required 15.8 h for the same reduction in social anxiety. Mediation analysis indicated that change in process variables specified in cognitive models accounted for 60% of the improvements associated with either treatment. Unlike the primary outcome, there was a significant but small difference in favour of CT-SAD on the behaviour test. Conclusions When compared to conventional face-to-face therapy, iCT-SAD can more than double the amount of symptom change associated with each therapist hour.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

However, little is known about multiple LTCs (MLTCs) clustering in this population. Methods People from South London with SMI and two or more existing LTCs aged 18+ at diagnosis were included using linked primary and mental healthcare records, 2012-2020. Latent class analysis (LCA) determined MLTC classes and multinominal logistic regression examined associations between demographic/clinical characteristics and latent class membership. Results The sample included 1924 patients (mean (s.d.) age 48.2 (17.3) years). Five latent classes were identified: 'substance related' (24.9%), 'atopic' (24.2%), 'pure affective' (30.4%), 'cardiovascular' (14.1%), and 'complex multimorbidity' (6.4%). Patients had on average 7-9 LTCs in each cluster. Males were at increased odds of MLTCs in all four clusters, compared to the 'pure affective'. Compared to the largest cluster ('pure affective'), the 'substance related' and the 'atopic' clusters were younger [odds ratios (OR) per year increase 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00) and 0.96 (0.95-0.97) respectively], and the 'cardiovascular' and 'complex multimorbidity' clusters were older (ORs 1.09 (1.07-1.10) and 1.16 (1.14-1.18) respectively). The 'substance related' cluster was more likely to be White, the 'cardiovascular' cluster more likely to be Black (compared to White; OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10-2.79), and both more likely to have schizophrenia, compared to other clusters. Conclusion The current study identified five latent class MLTC clusters among patients with SMI. An integrated care model for treating MLTCs in this population is recommended to improve multimorbidity care.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

It may hence be a common underlying feature associated with symptom severity of mental disorders. Methods We constructed a cross-sectional graphical Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) network and a relative importance network to estimate the relationships between anhedonia severity and the severity of symptom clusters of major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety sensitivity (AS), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a sample of Dutch adult psychiatric patients (N = 557). Results Both these networks revealed anhedonia severity and depression symptom severity as central to the network. Results suggest that anhedonia severity may be predictive of the severity of symptom clusters of MDD, AS, ADHD, and ASD. MDD symptom severity may be predictive of AS and ADHD symptom severity. Conclusions The results suggest that anhedonia may serve as a common underlying transdiagnostic psychopathology feature, predictive of the severity of symptom clusters of depression, AS, ADHD, and ASD. Thus, anhedonia may be associated with the high comorbidity between these symptom clusters and disorders. If our results will be replicated in future studies, it is recommended for clinicians to be more vigilant about screening for anhedonia and/or depression severity in individuals diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, ADHD and/or ASD.

This study examined relevant clinical features and psychosocial characteristics in UM compared with depressive-manic (D-M) subgroups. Moreover, comorbidity patterns of physical conditions and psychiatric disorders were evaluated between the UM and D-M groups. Methods This clinical retrospective study (N = 1015) analyzed cases with an average of 10 years of illness duration and a nationwide population-based cohort (N = 8343) followed up for 10 years in the Taiwanese population. UM was defined as patients who did not experience depressive episodes and were not prescribed adequate antidepressant treatment during the disease course of BD. Logistic regression models adjusted for relevant covariates were used to evaluate the characteristics and lifetime comorbidities in the two groups. Results The proportion of UM ranged from 12.91% to 14.87% in the two datasets. Compared with the D-M group, the UM group had more psychotic symptoms, fewer suicidal behaviors, a higher proportion of morningness chronotype, better sleep quality, higher extraversion, lower neuroticism, and less harm avoidance personality traits. Substantially different lifetime comorbidity patterns were observed between the two groups. Conclusions Patients with UM exhibited distinct clinical and psychosocial features compared with patients with the D-M subtype. In particular, a higher risk of comorbid cardiovascular diseases and anxiety disorders is apparent in patients with D-M. Further studies are warranted to investigate the underlying mechanisms for diverse presentations in subgroups of BDs.

Methods A 3-year UK-wide consecutive case series of all young people aged 10-19 who died by suicide, based on national mortality data. We extracted information on the antecedents of suicide of 544 of these 595 deaths (91%) from official investigations, mainly inquests. Results Suicide-related online experience was reported in 24% (n = 128/544) of suicide deaths in young people between 2014 and 2016, equivalent to 43 deaths per year, and was more common in girls than boys (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.23-2.85, p = 0.003) and those identifying as LGBT (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.10-5.05, p = 0.028). Searching for information about method was most common (n = 68, 13%), followed by posting suicidal ideas online (n = 57, 10%). Self-harm, bereavement (especially by suicide), social isolation, and mental and physical ill-health were more likely in those known to have suicide-related online experience compared to those who did not. 29 (5%) were bullied online, more often girls (OR 2.84, 1.34-6.04, p = 0.007). Online bullying often accompanied face-to-face bullying (n = 16/29, 67%). Conclusions Suicide-related online experience is a common, but likely underestimated, antecedent to suicide in young people. Although its causal role is unclear, it may influence suicidality in this population. Mental health professionals should be aware that suicide-related online experience - not limited to social media - is a potential risk for young patients, and may be linked to experiences offline.

Repetitive negative thinking (RNT), a cognitive process that encompasses past (rumination) and future (worry) directed thoughts focusing on negative experiences and the self, is a transdiagnostic construct that is especially relevant for major depressive disorder (MDD). Severe RNT often occurs in individuals with severe levels of MDD, which makes it challenging to disambiguate the neural circuitry underlying RNT from depression severity. Methods. We used a propensity score, i.e., a conditional probability of having high RNT given observed covariates to match high and low RNT individuals who are similar in the severity of depression, anxiety, and demographic characteristics. Of 148 MDD individuals, we matched high and low RNT groups (n = 50/group) and used a data-driven whole-brain voxel-to-voxel connectivity pattern analysis to investigate the resting-state functional connectivity differences between the groups. Results. There was an association between RNT and connectivity in the bilateral superior temporal sulcus (STS), an important region for speech processing including inner speech. High relative to low RNT individuals showed greater connectivity between right STS and bilateral anterior insular cortex (AI), and between bilateral STS and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Greater connectivity in those regions was specifically related to RNT but not to depression severity. Conclusions. RNT intensity is directly related to connectivity between STS and AI/DLPFC. This might be a mechanism underlying the role of RNT in perceptive, cognitive, speech, and emotional processing. Future investigations will need to determine whether modifying these connectivities could be a treatment target to reduce RNT. © The Author(s), 2022.

Altered resting-state connectivity in the fronto-limbic system has been reported in maltreated individuals. However, previous results in smaller samples differ largely regarding localization and direction of effects. Methods We included healthy and depressed samples [n = 624 participants with MDD; n = 701 healthy control (HC) participants] that underwent resting-state functional MRI measurements and provided retrospective self-reports of maltreatment using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. A-priori defined regions of interest [ROI; amygdala, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] were used to calculate seed-to-voxel connectivities. Results No significant associations between maltreatment and resting-state connectivity of any ROI were found across MDD and HC participants and no interaction effect with diagnosis became significant. Investigating MDD patients only yielded maltreatment-associated increased connectivity between the amygdala and dorsolateral frontal areas [pFDR < 0.001; η2partial = 0.050; 95%-CI (0.023-0.085)]. This effect was robust across various sensitivity analyses and was associated with concurrent and previous symptom severity. Particularly strong amygdala-frontal associations with maltreatment were observed in acutely depressed individuals [n = 264; pFDR < 0.001; η2partial = 0.091; 95%-CI (0.038-0.166)). Weaker evidence - not surviving correction for multiple ROI analyses - was found for altered supracallosal ACC connectivity in HC individuals associated with maltreatment. Conclusions The majority of previous resting-state connectivity correlates of CM could not be replicated in this large-scale study.

Future studies should explore the relevance of this pathway for a maltreated subgroup of MDD patients.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

However, a virtual reality paradigm simulating travel on the London Underground has been found to evoke referential ideation in both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, making brain activations in response to such experiences potentially identifiable. Method Ninety patients with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder and 28 healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while they viewed virtual reality versions of full and empty Barcelona Metro carriages. Results Compared to the empty condition, viewing the full carriage was associated with activations in the visual cortex, the cuneus and precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, the inferior parietal cortex, the angular gyrus and parts of the middle and superior temporal cortex including the temporoparietal junction bilaterally. There were no significant differences in activation between groups. Nor were there activations associated with referentiality or presence of delusions generally in the patient group. However, patients with persecutory delusions showed a cluster of reduced activation compared to those without delusions in a region in the right temporal/occipital cortex. Conclusions Performance of the metro task is associated with a widespread pattern of activations, which does not distinguish schizophrenic patients and controls, or show an association with referentiality or delusions in general. However, the finding of a cluster of reduced activation close to the right temporoparietal junction in patients with persecutory delusions specifically is of potential interest, as this region is believed to play a role in social cognition.

The association between autism and MRBs is little understood. Methods Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, an UK-based longitudinal, birth cohort study. Exposures were diagnosed autism and four autistic traits: social communication difficulties, pragmatic language, repetitive behaviours and reduced sociability. Outcomes were participation in up to 14 risk behaviours, including alcohol consumption, smoking, risky sexual behaviours and physical inactivity. Outcome data were collected at ages approximately 12, 14, 16 and 18. Results Up to 4300 participants were included in latent basis growth curve analyses with adjustment for confounders. Social communication difficulties were associated with an above average level of MRBs engagement at ~12 years (mean difference β 0.26; 95% CI 0.13-0.40), and above average rate of engagement from ages ~12-18 (β 0.08; 95% CI 0.02-0.13). Repetitive behaviours were associated with above average levels of engagement in MRBs at ~12 years (β 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.38). Contrastingly, reduced sociability was associated with a reduced rate of engagement in MRBs from ages ~12-18 (β -0.06; 95% CI -0.11 to -0.02). In sex-specific analyses, persisting differences in MRB engagement patterns from ages ~12-18 were observed in males with social communication difficulties and females with reduced sociability temperament. Conclusions Having elevated levels of some autistic traits appear to have differentiated effects on MRB engagement patterns. These findings could reflect difficulties fitting in and/or coping mechanisms relating to difficulties with fitting in.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Therefore, the aims were to dissect the heterogeneous neurodevelopmental deviations of the affective brain circuitry and provide an integration of these differences across modalities. Methods We combined two novel approaches. First, normative modeling to map deviations from the typical age-related pattern at the level of the individual of (i) activity during emotion matching and (ii) of anatomical images derived from DBD cases (n = 77) and controls (n = 52) aged 8-18 years from the EU-funded Aggressotype and MATRICS consortia. Second, linked independent component analysis to integrate subject-specific deviations from both modalities. Results While cases exhibited on average a higher activity than would be expected for their age during face processing in regions such as the amygdala when compared to controls these positive deviations were widespread at the individual level. A multimodal integration of all functional and anatomical deviations explained 23% of the variance in the clinical DBD phenotype. Most notably, the top marker, encompassing the default mode network (DMN) and subcortical regions such as the amygdala and the striatum, was related to aggression across the whole sample. Conclusions Overall increased age-related deviations in the amygdala in DBD suggest a maturational delay, which has to be further validated in future studies. Further, the integration of individual deviation patterns from multiple imaging modalities allowed to dissect some of the heterogeneity of DBD and identified the DMN, the striatum and the amygdala as neural signatures that were associated with aggression.

Little is known however about how current pharmacotherapies act to modulate the neural mechanisms underlying these key processes. The current study therefore investigated the neural effects of fluoxetine on emotional reactivity and cognitive reappraisal in adolescent depression. Methods Thirty-one adolescents with MDD were randomised to acute fluoxetine (10 mg) or placebo. Seventeen healthy adolescents were also recruited but did not receive any treatment for ethical reasons. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants viewed aversive images and were asked to either experience naturally the emotional state elicited ('Maintain') or to reinterpret the content of the pictures to reduce negative affect ('Reappraise'). Significant activations were identified using whole-brain analysis. Results No significant group differences were seen when comparing Reappraise and Maintain conditions. However, when compared to healthy controls, depressed adolescents on placebo showed reduced visual activation to aversive pictures irrespective of the condition. The depressed adolescent group on fluoxetine showed the opposite pattern, i.e. increased visuo-cerebellar activity in response to aversive pictures, when compared to depressed adolescents on placebo. Conclusions These data suggest that depression in adolescence may be associated with reduced visual processing of aversive imagery and that fluoxetine may act to reduce avoidance of such cues. This could reflect a key mechanism whereby depressed adolescents engage with negative cues previously avoided. Future research combining fMRI with eye-tracking is nonetheless needed to further clarify these effects.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

The mechanisms underlying this association are not clear and have been suggested to be caused by residual confounding. The main objective of this study was to separate the familial and individual risk for CVD mortality and all-cause mortality related to alcohol consumption. This will be done by estimating the risk for CVD mortality and all-cause mortality in twin pairs discordant for alcohol consumption. Methods Alcohol consumption was assessed at two time points using self-report questionnaires in the Norwegian Twin Registry. Data on CVD mortality was obtained from the Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Exposure-outcome associations for all-cause mortality and mortality due to other causes than CVD were estimated for comparison. Results Coming from a family with moderate to high alcohol consumption was protective against cardiovascular death (HR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.65-0.83). Moderate and high alcohol consumption levels were associated with a slightly increased risk of CVD mortality at the individual level (HR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.02-1.73). There was no association between alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality both at the familial nor at the individual level. Conclusions The protective association of moderate to high alcohol consumption with a lower risk of CVD mortality was accounted for by familial factors in this study of twins. Early life genetic and environmental familial factors may mask an absence of health effect of moderate to high alcohol consumption on cardiovascular mortality.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This study compared bereavement outcomes for partners of same-gender and different-gender decedents. Methods In this population-based, cross-sectional survey of people bereaved of a civil partner or spouse 6-10 months previously, we used adjusted logistic and linear regression to investigate outcomes of interest: (1) positive screen on Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG), (2) positive screen on General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), (3) grief intensity (ICG) and (4) psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12). Results Among 233 same-gender partners and 329 of different-gender partners, 66.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 60.0-72.2] and 59.2% [95% CI (53.9-64.6)] respectively screened positive for complicated grief on the ICG, whilst 76.0% [95% CI (70.5-81.5)] and 69.3% [95% CI (64.3-74.3)] respectively screened positive on the GHQ-12. Same-gender bereaved partners were not significantly more likely to screen positive for complicated grief than different-gender partners [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.56, 95% CI (0.98-2.47)], p = 0.059, but same-gender bereaved partners were significantly more likely to screen for psychiatric caseness [aOR 1.67 (1.02, 2.71) p = 0.043]. We similarly found no significant association of partner gender with grief intensity [B = 1.86, 95% CI (-0.91to 4.63), p = 0.188], but significantly greater psychological distress for same-gender partners [B = 1.54, 95% CI (-0.69-2.40), p < 0.001]. Conclusions Same-gender bereaved partners report significantly more psychological distress. In view of their poorer sub-clinical mental health, clinical and bereavement services should refine screening processes to identify those at risk of poor mental health outcomes.

Methods Participants were formerly depressed patients (N = 41) in remission who (gradually) discontinued antidepressants. Participants completed five smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) a day, for a period of 4 months, yielding a total of 21 180 observations. Statistical Process Control by means of Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) control charts was used to detect rises in the EMA item 'I feel restless', for each individual separately. Results An increase in restlessness was detected in 68.3% of the participants with recurring depressive symptoms, and in 26.3% of those who stayed in remission (Fisher's exact test p = 0.01, sensitivity was 68.3%, specificity was 73.7%). In the participants with a recurrence and an increase in restlessness, this increase could be detected in the prodromal phase of depression in 93.3% of the cases and at least a month before the onset of the core symptoms of depression in 66.7% of the cases. Conclusions Restlessness is a common prodromal symptom of depression. The sensitivity and specificity of the EWMA charts was at least as good as prognostic models based on cross-sectional patient characteristics. An advantage of the current idiographic method is that the EWMA charts provide real-time personalized insight in a within-person increase in early signs of depression, which is key to alert the right patient at the right time.

Individuals with substantial PTSS (≥33, Impact of Events Scale - Revised) 6 months after MVC were identified via follow-up questionnaire. Sociodemographic, pain, general health, event, and psychological/cognitive characteristics were collected in the ED and used in prediction modeling. Ensemble learning methods and Monte Carlo cross-validation were used for feature selection and to determine prediction accuracy. External validation was performed on a hold-out sample (30% of total sample). Results Twenty-five percent (n = 394) of individuals reported PTSS 6 months following MVC. Regularized linear regression was the top performing learning method. The top 30 factors together showed good reliability in predicting PTSS in the external sample (Area under the curve = 0.79 ± 0.002). Top predictors included acute pain severity, recovery expectations, socioeconomic status, self-reported race, and psychological symptoms. Conclusions These analyses add to a growing literature indicating that influential predictors of PTSS can be identified and risk for future PTSS estimated from characteristics easily available/assessable at the time of ED presentation following TSE.

Methods In a Swedish cohort (N = 744 628), associations between spousal DAD and BPN and proband AUD were estimated with Cox proportional hazards; associations between parental AUD, proband premarital AUD, and spousal lifetime DAD and BPN were estimated with logistic regression; and whether spousal DAD or BPN causally increased risk for AUD was evaluated with frailty models. Results Spousal premarital DAD, spousal marital-onset DAD, and spousal BPN (premarital or marital-onset) were associated with proband AUD during marriage [hazard ratios (HR) range 1.44-3.72]. Those with a parental or premarital history of AUD (v. without) were more likely to marry a spouse with DAD or BPN (odds ratios 1.22-2.77). Moving from an unaffected first spouse to a DAD-affected second spouse increased AUD risk in males (HR 2.90). Moving from an unaffected first spouse to a BPN-affected second spouse increased AUD risk (HRmales 3.96; HRfemales 5.64). Moving to an unaffected second spouse from a DAD-affected first spouse decreased AUD risk, with stronger evidence in females compared to males (HRmales 0.59; HRfemales 0.28). Conclusions Associations between spousal DAD or BPN and proband AUD reflect both selection and causal effects. Marriage to a BPN-affected spouse has a particularly strong effect on AUD risk, with more modest effects for spousal DAD.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Studies using arterial spin labelling (ASL) have shown reduction of cortical CBF and increased subcortical CBF in SCZ. Previous studies have investigated CBF using ASL in FEP, reporting increased CBF in striatum and reduced CBF in frontal cortex. However, as these people were taking antipsychotics, it is unclear whether these changes are related to the disorder or antipsychotic treatment and how they relate to treatment response. Methods We examined CBF in FEP free from antipsychotic medication (N = 21), compared to healthy controls (N = 22). Both absolute and relative-to-global CBF were assessed. We also investigated the association between baseline CBF and treatment response in a partially nested follow-up study (N = 14). Results There was significantly lower absolute CBF in frontal cortex (Cohen's d = 0.84, p = 0.009) and no differences in striatum or hippocampus. Whole brain voxel-wise analysis revealed widespread cortical reductions in absolute CBF in large cortical clusters that encompassed occipital, parietal and frontal cortices (Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE)-corrected <0.05). No differences were found in relative-to-global CBF in the selected region of interests and in voxel-wise analysis. Relative-to-global frontal CBF was correlated with percentage change in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale after antipsychotic treatment (r = 0.67, p = 0.008). Conclusions These results show lower cortical absolute perfusion in FEP prior to starting antipsychotic treatment and suggest relative-to-global frontal CBF as assessed with magnetic resonance imaging could potentially serve as a biomarker for antipsychotic response.

However, there have been few attempts to incorporate data on subjective experiences under different AD. Method We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the posts from the website www.askapatient.com from different AD. We reviewed a random sample of 1000 posts. Result After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we included a final sample of 450 posts, 50 on each of the most used AD: sertraline, citalopram, paroxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, mirtazapine, and bupropion. Bupropion, citalopram, and venlafaxine had the higher overall satisfaction ratings. Sertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine had high reports of emotional blunting, while bupropion very few. Overall satisfaction with AD treatment was inversely associated with the presence of the following side-effects: suicidality, irritability, emotional blunting, cognitive disturbances, and withdrawal symptoms. After adjusting for confounders, only emotional blunting was shown to be more frequently reported by users of serotonergic agents, as compared to non-serotoninergic agents. Conclusion This research points out that the subjective experience of patients under treatment should be taken into consideration when selecting an AD as differences between agents were evident. In contrast to the more frequent treatment decisions, users might prefer receiving a non-serotoninergic agent over a serotonergic one due to their lower propensity to produce emotional blunting.

However, evidence for the safety of concomitantly using a methylphenidate (MPH) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) among adolescent ADHD patients is limited, a literature gap aimed to address through this investigation. Methods We conducted a new-user cohort study using a nationwide claims database in South Korea. We identified a study population as adolescents who were diagnosed both ADHD and depressive disorder. MPH-only users were compared with patients who prescribed both a SSRI and a MPH. Fluoxetine and escitalopram users were also compared to find a preferable treatment option. Thirteen outcomes including neuropsychiatric, gastrointestinal, and other events were assessed, taking respiratory tract infection as a negative control outcome. We matched the study groups using a propensity score and used the Cox proportional hazard model to calculate the hazard ratio. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted in various epidemiologic settings. Results The risks of all the outcomes between the MPH-only and SSRI groups were not significantly different. Regarding SSRI ingredients, the risk of tic disorder was significantly lower in the fluoxetine group than the escitalopram group [HR 0.43 (0.25-0.71)]. However, there was no significant difference in other outcomes between the fluoxetine and escitalopram groups. Conclusion The concomitant use of MPHs and SSRIs showed generally safe profiles in adolescent ADHD patients with depression. Most of the differences between fluoxetine and escitalopram, except those concerning tic disorder, were not significant.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

This dissociation has also been observed in memory, with verbal learning skills described as a relative strength. Yet the development of these skills is still to be investigated. We thus aimed to explore verbal learning longitudinally. Furthermore, we explored verbal learning and its respective associations with hippocampal alterations and psychosis, which remain largely unknown despite their high prevalence in 22q11.2DS. Methods In total, 332 individuals (173 with 22q11.2DS) aged 5-30 years completed a verbal-paired associates task. Mixed-models regression analyses were conducted to explore developmental trajectories with threefold objectives. First, verbal learning and retention trajectories were compared between 22q11.2DS vs. HC. Second, we examined hippocampal volume development in 22q11.2DS participants with lower vs. higher verbal learning performance. Third, we explored verbal learning trajectories in 22q11.2DS participants with vs. without positive psychotic symptoms and with vs. without a psychotic spectrum disorder (PSD). Results Our findings first reveal lower verbal learning performance in 22q11.2DS, with a developmental plateau emerging from adolescence. Second, participants with lower verbal learning scores displayed a reduced left hippocampal tail volume. Third, participants with PSD showed a deterioration of verbal learning performance, independently of verbal reasoning skills. Conclusion Our study challenges the current view of preserved verbal learning skills in 22q11.2DS and highlights associations with specific hippocampal alterations. We further identify verbal learning as a novel cognitive marker for psychosis in 22q11.2DS.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Method Using linked multi-agency administrative data for 71 932 children from the New South Wales Child Developmental Study, using logistic regression, we examined associations between 16 environmental risk factors in early life (prenatal period to <6 years of age) and later diagnoses of mental disorder recorded in health service data (from age 6 to 13 years), both individually and summed as an environmental risk score (ERS). Results The ERS was associated with all types of mental disorder diagnoses in a dose-response fashion, such that 2.8% of children with no exposure to any of the environmental factors (ERS = 0), compared to 18.3% of children with an ERS of 8 or more indicating exposure to 8 or more environmental factors (ERS 8), had been diagnosed with any type of mental disorder up to age 13-14 years. Thirteen of the 16 environmental factors measured (including prenatal factors, neighbourhood characteristics and more proximal experiences of trauma or neglect) were positively associated with at least one category of mental disorder. Conclusion Exposure to cumulative environmental risk factors in early life is associated with an increased likelihood of presenting to health services in childhood for any kind of mental disorder. In many instances, these factors are preventable or capable of mitigation by appropriate public policy settings.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) is a primary care therapy service commissioned by England’s National Health Service (NHS) for people with unipolar depression and anxiety-related disorders. Its scope does not extend to ‘severe mental illness’, including bipolar disorders (BD), but evidence suggests there is a high BD prevalence in ostensibly unipolar major depressive disorder (uMDD) samples. This study aimed to indicate the prevalence and characteristics of people with BD in a naturalistic cohort of IAPT patients. Methods. 371 participants were assessed before initiating therapy. Participants were categorised by indicated diagnoses: BD type-I (BD-I) or type-II (BD-II) as defined using a DSM diagnostic interview, bipolar spectrum (BSp, not meeting diagnostic criteria but exceeding BD screening thresholds), lifetime uMDD or other. Information about psychiatric history and co-morbidities was examined, along with symptoms before and after therapy. Results. 368 patients provided sufficient data to enable classification. 10% of participants were grouped as having BD-I, 20% BD-II, 40% BSp, 25% uMDD and 5% other. BD and uMDD participants had similar demographic characteristics, but patients meeting criteria for BD-I/ BD-II had more complex psychiatric presentations. All three ‘bipolar’ groups had particularly high rates of anxiety disorders. IAPT therapy receipt was comparable between groups, as was therapy response (F9704 = 1.113, p = 0.351). Conclusions. Notwithstanding the possibility that bipolar diathesis was overestimated, findings illustrate a high prevalence of BD in groups of people notionally with uMDD or anxiety. As well as improving the detection of BD, further substantive investigation is required to establish whether individuals affected by BD should be eligible for primary care psychological intervention. © The Author(s), 2022.

Accumulating evidence suggests that persons with lifetime histories of comorbid AUD and non-alcohol substance use disorder (DRUG) constitute an important subgroup of AUD. This study evaluated the distinctiveness of the comorbid AUD/DRUG behavioral phenotype in a community sample with respect to risk factors, AUD course features, and outcome variables assessed at age 30. Contrast groups included persons with histories of AUD only, DRUG only, and neither AUD nor DRUG. Methods This research utilized a prospective study design with an age-based cohort (n = 732). Participants completed four comprehensive diagnostic evaluations during the high-risk periods of adolescence, emerging adulthood, and young adulthood. Results The comorbid AUD/DRUG group was distinguished from the AUD only group by risk factors, AUD course features, and outcomes. Group differences in outcomes were also explained by overall substance use disorder (SUD) severity. Persons with AUD/DRUG comorbidity were indistinguishable from those with DRUG only histories with respect to risk factors and outcomes but demonstrated greater overall SUD severity. Persons with AUD only were indistinguishable from those with neither AUD nor DRUG histories in risk factor endorsements and were mostly similar in outcomes. Conclusions Findings collectively suggest that young adults with histories of AUD only and those with comorbid AUD/DRUG are drawn from dissimilar populations. Similarities between the AUD only group with those absent AUD or DRUG histories are likely related to the former group's developmentally limited AUD course accompanied by relatively few or short-lived alcohol-related problems.

The current study aims to fill this gap by examining how changes in NSSI frequency over time related to concurrent changes in suicide thoughts and behaviors. Methods Data came from a sample of 403 self-injuring young adults who completed assessments of NSSI and suicide thoughts and behaviors at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Bivariate latent growth modeling, adjusting for covariates of lifetime NSSI frequency and treatment status, was used to examine the extent to which changes in NSSI frequency related to suicide ideation and suicide planning. Results The frequency of NSSI declined across the study period. The slopes of NSSI and suicide ideation were significantly correlated, suggesting individuals with sharper declines in NSSI across time also showed sharper declines in suicide ideation. The intercepts between NSSI and suicide planning were significantly correlated, suggesting those with high NSSI frequency at baseline tended to report higher suicide planning across time. After covariate adjustment, the intercept of suicide planning marginally (p = 0.08) correlated with the slope of NSSI, tentatively suggesting that those who had less reductions in NSSI tended to have higher frequencies of suicide planning. Conclusion These results provide new evidence that changes in NSSI are related to subsequent changes in suicide thoughts and behaviors. Monitoring suicide risk among those with NSSI is important and treatment aiming to reduce NSSI may also reduce suicide risk.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

The neuropathology of depression is related to abnormal inter-regional structural covariance indicating a brain maturational disruption. However, most studies focus on group-level structural covariance aberrance and ignore the interindividual heterogeneity. For that reason, we aimed to identify individualized structural covariance aberrance with the help of individualized differential structural covariance network (IDSCN) analysis. Methods T1-weighted anatomical images of 195 first-episode untreated patients with depression and matched healthy controls (n = 78) were acquired. We obtained IDSCN for each patient and identified subtypes of depression based on shared differential edges. Results As a result, patients with depression demonstrated tremendous heterogeneity in the distribution of differential structural covariance edges. Despite this heterogeneity, altered edges within subcortical-cerebellum network were often shared by most of the patients. Two robust neuroanatomical subtypes were identified. Specifically, patients in subtype 1 often shared decreased motor network-related edges. Patients in subtype 2 often shared decreased subcortical-cerebellum network-related edges. Functional annotation further revealed that differential edges in subtype 2 were mainly implicated in reward/motivation-related functional terms. Conclusions In conclusion, we investigated individualized differential structural covariance and identified that decreased edges within subcortical-cerebellum network are often shared by patients with depression. The identified two subtypes provide new insights into taxonomy and facilitate potential clues to precision diagnosis and treatment of depression. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This study investigated the use and discontinuation of antipsychotics in individuals with first-episode schizophrenia in relation to cohabitation, living with children, employment, hospital admission and death. Methods Danish registers were used to establish a nationwide cohort of individuals ≥18 years with schizophrenia included at the time of diagnosis in1995-2013. Exposure was antipsychotic medication calculated using defined daily dose and redeemed prescriptions year 2-5. Outcomes year 5-6 were analysed using binary logistic, negative binomial and Cox proportional hazard regression. Results Among 21 351, 9.3% took antipsychotics continuously year 2-5, 38.6% took no antipsychotics, 3.4% sustained discontinuation and 48.7% discontinued and resumed treatment. At follow-up year 6, living with children or employment was significantly higher in individuals with sustained discontinuation (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.53-2.56 and OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.91-3.54), non-sustained discontinuation (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.48 and 2.04, 95% CI 1.64-2.53) and no antipsychotics (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.69-2.38 and 5.64, 95% CI 4.56-6.97) compared to continuous users. Individuals with non-sustained discontinuation had more psychiatric hospital admissions (IRR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10-1.47) and longer admissions (IRR 1.68, 95% CI 1.30-2.16) year 5-6 compared to continuous users. Mortality during year 5-6 did not differ between groups. Conclusion Most individuals with first-episode schizophrenia discontinued or took no antipsychotics the first years after diagnosis and had better functional outcomes. Non-sustained discontinuers had more, and longer admissions compared to continuous users. However, associations found could be either cause or effect.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Scar models posit the reverse association. However, most studies that tested relationships between non-specific immune/endocrine markers and depression did not separate temporal inferences between people and within-person and how different immunometabolism markers related to unique depression symptoms. We thus used cross-lagged prospective network analyses (CLPN) to investigate this topic. Methods Community midlife women (n = 2224) completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale and provided biomarker samples across five time-points spanning 9 years. CLPN identified significant relations (edges) among components (nodes) of depression (depressed mood, somatic symptoms, interpersonal issues), lipid markers [insulin, fasting glucose, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL)], and proinflammatory proteins [C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen], within and across time-points. All models adjusted for age, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, and menopausal status. Results In within-person temporal networks, higher CRP and HDL predicted all three depression components (d = 0.131-2.112). Increased LDL preceded higher depressed mood and interpersonal issues (v. somatic symptoms) (d = 0.251-0.327). Elevated triglycerides predicted more somatic symptoms (v. depressed mood and interpersonal problems) (d = 0.131). More interpersonal problems forecasted elevated fibrinogen and LDL levels (d = 0.129-0.331), and stronger somatic symptoms preceded higher fibrinogen levels (d = 0.188). Conclusions Results supported both vulnerability and scar models. Long-term dysregulated immunometabolism systems, social disengagement, and related patterns are possible mechanistic accounts. Cognitive-behavioral therapies that optimize nutrition and physical activity may effectively target depression. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Approximately 84% of American adolescents own a smartphone, which can continuously and unobtrusively track variables potentially predictive of heightened negative emotions (e.g. activity levels, location, pattern of phone usage). The extent to which built-in smartphone sensors can reliably predict states of elevated negative affect in adolescents is an open question. Methods Adolescent participants (n = 22; ages 13-18) with low to high levels of depressive symptoms were followed for 15 weeks using a combination of ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and continuously collected passive smartphone sensor data. EMAs probed negative emotional states (i.e. anger, sadness and anxiety) 2-3 times per day every other week throughout the study (total: 1145 EMA measurements). Smartphone accelerometer, location and device state data were collected to derive 14 discrete estimates of behavior, including activity level, percentage of time spent at home, sleep onset and duration, and phone usage. Results A personalized ensemble machine learning model derived from smartphone sensor data outperformed other statistical approaches (e.g. linear mixed model) and predicted states of elevated anger and anxiety with acceptable discrimination ability (area under the curve (AUC) = 74% and 71%, respectively), but demonstrated more modest discrimination ability for predicting states of high sadness (AUC = 66%). Conclusions To the extent that smartphone data could provide reasonably accurate real-time predictions of states of high negative affect in teens, brief 'just-in-time' interventions could be immediately deployed via smartphone notifications or mental health apps to alleviate these states.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective for refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Post-operative cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may augment the effects of DBS, but previous results are conflicting. Here, we investigated whether CBT augments the effect of DBS for OCD. Method. Patients with and without CBT following DBS of the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule were included. First, we analyzed Yale–Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores before, during and after CBT in all patients with CBT. Second, we matched patients with and without CBT based on clinical baseline variables and initial response to DBS and compared the course of Y-BOCS and HAM-D scores over the same timeframe. Results. In total, 36 patients with and 16 patients without CBT were included. Average duration of CBT was 10.4 months (S.D. 6.4). In the 36 patients with CBT, Y-BOCS scores decreased on average by 3.8 points (14.8%) from start until end of CBT (p = 0.043). HAM-D scores did not decrease following CBT. Second, 10 patients with CBT were matched to 10 patients without CBT. In both groups, Y-BOCS scores decreased equally from start until end of CBT or over a similar timeframe (10% in CBT group v. 13.1% in no-CBT group, p = 0.741). Conclusions. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms decreased over time in patients with and without post-operative CBT. Therefore, further improvement may be attributed to late effects of DBS itself. The present study emphasizes the need for prospective randomized controlled studies, examining the effects of CBT. © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Psychotic experiences and negative symptoms (PENS) are common in nonclinical populations. PENS are associated with adverse outcomes, particularly when they persist. Little is known about the trajectories of PENS dimensions in young people, nor about the precursory factors associated with these trajectories. Methods. We conducted growth mixture modelling of paranoia, hallucinations, and negative symptoms across ages 16, 17, and 22 in a community sample (N = 12 049–12 652). We then described the emergent trajectory classes through their associations with genome-wide polygenic scores (GPS) for psychiatric and educational phenotypes, and earlier childhood characteristics. Results. Three trajectory classes emerged for paranoia, two for hallucinations, and two for negative symptoms. Across PENS, GPS for clinical help-seeking, major depressive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were associated with increased odds of being in the most elevated trajectory class (OR 1.07–1.23). Lower education GPS was associated with the most elevated trajectory class for hallucinations and negative symptoms (OR 0.77–0.91). Conversely for paranoia, higher education GPS was associated with the most elevated trajectory class (OR 1.25). Trajectory class associations were not significant for schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, or anorexia GPS. Emotional/behaviour problems and life events in childhood were associated with increased odds of being in the most elevated trajectory class across PENS. Conclusions. Our results suggest latent heterogeneity in the development of paranoia, hallucinations, and negative symptoms in young people that is associated with specific polygenic scores and childhood characteristics. © The Author(s), 2022.

However, little research has examined whether online religious participation improves these outcomes, especially when in-person attendance is suspended. Methods Using longitudinal data of 8951 UK adults, this study prospectively examined the association between frequency of online religious participation during the stringent lockdown in the UK (23 March -13 May 2020) and 21 indicators of psychological well-being, social well-being, pro-social/altruistic behaviors, psychological distress, and health behaviors. All analyses adjusted for baseline socio-demographic characteristics, pre-pandemic in-person religious service attendance, and prior values of the outcome variables whenever data were available. Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing. Results Individuals with online religious participation of ≥1/week (v. those with no participation at all) during the lockdown had a lower prevalence of thoughts of self-harm in week 20 (odds ratio 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.62). Online religious participation of <1/week (v. no participation) was associated with higher life satisfaction (standardized β = 0.25; 0.11-0.39) and happiness (standardized β = 0.25; 0.08-0.42). However, there was little evidence for the associations between online religious participation and all other outcomes (e.g. depressive symptoms and anxiety). Conclusions There was evidence that online religious participation during the lockdown was associated with some subsequent health and well-being outcomes. Future studies should examine mechanisms underlying the inconsistent results for online v. in-person religious service attendance and also use data from non-pandemic situations.

Results The overall prevalence rate of pandemic paranoia was 19%, and was highest in Australia and lowest in Germany. On the subscales of the PPS, prevalence was 11% for persecutory threat, 29% for paranoid conspiracy and 37% for interpersonal mistrust.

We investigated whether genetic vulnerability to PTSD as measured by polygenic score (PGS) increases the risk of PPD and whether a predisposition to PTSD in PPD cases exceeds that of major depressive disorder (MDD) outside the postpartum period. Methods This case-control study included participants from the iPSYCH2015, a case-cohort of all singletons born in Denmark between 1981 and 2008. Restricting to women born between 1981 and 1997 and excluding women with a first diagnosis other than depression (N = 22 613), 333 were identified with PPD. For each PPD case, 999 representing the background population and 993 with MDD outside the postpartum were matched by calendar year at birth, cohort selection, and age. PTSD PGS was calculated from summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium with LDpred2-auto. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression adjusted for parental psychiatric history and country of origin, PGS for MDD and age at first birth, and the first 10 principal components. Results The PTSD PGS was significantly associated with PPD (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.20-1.68 per standard deviation increase in PTSD PGS) compared to healthy female controls. Genetic PTSD vulnerability in PPD cases did not exceed that of matched female depression cases outside the postpartum period (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.94-1.30 per standard deviation increase).

Methods In the current study, segmentation of amygdala and hippocampal sub-regions was used to investigate the longitudinal changes of volume, the relationship between volume and antidepressant effects, and prediction performances for ECT in MDD patients before and after ECT using two independent datasets. Results As a result, MDD patients showed selectively and consistently increased volume in the left lateral nucleus, right accessory basal nucleus, bilateral basal nucleus, bilateral corticoamygdaloid transition (CAT), bilateral paralaminar nucleus of the amygdala, and bilateral hippocampus-amygdala transition area (HATA) after ECT in both datasets, whereas marginally significant increase of volume in bilateral granule cell molecular layer of the head of dentate gyrus, the bilateral head of cornu ammonis (CA) 4, and left head of CA 3. Correlation analyses revealed that increased volume of left HATA was significantly associated with antidepressant effects after ECT. Moreover, volumes of HATA in the MDD patients before ECT could be served as potential biomarkers to predict ECT remission with the highest accuracy of 86.95% and 82.92% in two datasets (The predictive models were trained on Dataset 2 and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of Dataset 2 were obtained from leave-one-out-cross-validation. Thus, they were not independent and very likely to be inflated). Conclusions These results not only suggested that ECT could selectively induce structural plasticity of the amygdala and hippocampal sub-regions associated with antidepressant effects of ECT in MDD patients, but also provided potential biomarkers (especially HATA) for effectively and timely interventions for ECT in clinical applications.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of PSIs for individuals with mental illness for clinical, personal, and functional recovery outcomes. Methods Searches were conducted in PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO (December 18, 2020). Included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing peer-delivered PSIs to control conditions. The quality of records was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool. Data were pooled for each outcome, using random-effects models. Results After screening 3455 records, 30 RCTs were included in the systematic review and 28 were meta-analyzed (4152 individuals). Compared to control conditions, peer support was associated with small but significant post-test effect sizes for clinical recovery, g = 0.19, 95% CI (0.11-0.27), I2 = 10%, 95% CI (0-44), and personal recovery, g = 0.15, 95% CI (0.04-0.27), I2 = 43%, 95% CI (1-67), but not for functional recovery, g = 0.08, 95% CI (-0.02 to 0.18), I2 = 36%, 95% CI (0-61). Our findings should be considered with caution due to the modest quality of the included studies. Conclusions PSIs may be effective for the clinical and personal recovery of mental illness. Effects are modest, though consistent, suggesting potential efficacy for PSI across a wide range of mental disorders and intervention types. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

There is considerable cognitive heterogeneity that exists within both disorders. Studies that cluster schizophrenia and bipolar patients into subgroups based on their cognitive profile increasingly demonstrate that, relative to healthy controls, there is a severely compromised subgroup and a relatively intact subgroup. There is emerging evidence that telomere shortening, a marker of cellular senescence, may be associated with cognitive impairments. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between cognitive subgroups in bipolar-schizophrenia spectrum disorders and telomere length against a healthy control sample. Methods Participants included a transdiagnostic group diagnosed with bipolar, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (n = 73) and healthy controls (n = 113). Cognitive clusters within the transdiagnostic patient group, were determined using K-means cluster analysis based on current cognitive functioning (MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery scores). Telomere length was determined using quantitative PCRs genomic DNA extracted from whole blood. Emergent clusters were then compared to the healthy control group on telomere length. Results Two clusters emerged within the patient group that were deemed to reflect a relatively intact cognitive group and a cognitively impaired subgroup. Telomere length was significantly shorter in the severely impaired cognitive subgroup compared to the healthy control group. Conclusions This study replicates previous findings of transdiagnostic cognitive subgroups and associates shorter telomere length with the severely impaired cognitive subgroup. These findings support emerging literature associating cognitive impairments in psychiatric disorders to accelerated cellular aging as indexed by telomere length.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Few studies, however, have examined whether social threat affects fronto-cingulate-limbic systems implicated in adolescent depression. Methods We assessed lifetime stressor severity across several domains using the Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN) in 57 depressed adolescents (16.15 ± 1.32 years, 34 females), and examined whether the severity of social threat and non-social threat stressors was associated with gray matter volumes (GMVs) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), amygdala, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). We also examined how lifetime social threat severity and GMVs in these regions related to depressive symptoms at baseline and over 9 months. Results General stressor severity was related to greater depression severity at baseline and over 9 months. Moreover, greater severity of social threat (but not non-social threat) stressors was associated with smaller bilateral amygdala and NAcc GMVs, and smaller bilateral surface areas of caudal and rostral ACC (all pFDR 0.048). However, neither social threat nor non-social threat stressor severity was related to hippocampal GMVs (all pFDR ≥ 0.318). All fronto-cingulate-limbic structures that were associated with the severity of social threat were negatively associated with greater depression severity over 9 months (all pFDR 0.014). Post-hoc analyses suggested that gray matter morphometry of bilateral amygdala, NAcc, and rostral and caudal ACC mediated the association between social threat and depression severity in adolescents over 9 months (all pFDR < 0.048). Conclusions Social threat specifically affects fronto-cingulate-limbic pathways that contribute to the maintenance of depression in adolescents.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This study aimed to identify pre-COVID brain functional connectome that predicts pandemic-related distress symptoms among young adults. Methods Baseline neuroimaging studies and assessment of general distress using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale were performed with 100 healthy individuals prior to wide recognition of the health risks associated with the emergence of COVID-19. They were recontacted for the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist in the period of community-level outbreaks, and for follow-up distress evaluation again 1 year later. We employed the network-based statistic approach to identify connectome that predicted the increase of distress based on 136-region-parcellation with assigned network membership. Predictive performance of connectome features and causal relations were examined by cross-validation and mediation analyses. Results The connectome features that predicted emergence of distress after COVID contained 70 neural connections. Most within-network connections were located in the default mode network (DMN), and affective network-DMN and dorsal attention network-DMN links largely constituted between-network pairs. The hippocampus emerged as the most critical hub region. Predictive models of the connectome remained robust in cross-validation. Mediation analyses demonstrated that COVID-related posttraumatic stress partially explained the correlation of connectome to the development of general distress. Conclusions Brain functional connectome may fingerprint individuals with vulnerability to psychological distress associated with the COVID pandemic. Individuals with brain neuromarkers may benefit from the corresponding interventions to reduce the risk or severity of distress related to fear of COVID-related challenges.

We assessed the experience with one such therapy of patients diagnosed with psychosis, including satisfaction, side effects, and positive experiences of access to the technology. We tested whether side effects affected therapy. Methods In a clinical trial 122 patients diagnosed with psychosis completed baseline measures of psychiatric symptoms, received gameChange VR therapy, and then completed a satisfaction questionnaire, the Oxford-VR Side Effects Checklist, and outcome measures. Results 79 (65.8%) patients were very satisfied with VR therapy, 37 (30.8%) were mostly satisfied, 3 (2.5%) were indifferent/mildly dissatisfied, and 1 (0.8%) person was quite dissatisfied. The most common side effects were: difficulties concentrating because of thinking about what might be happening in the room (n = 17, 14.2%); lasting headache (n = 10, 8.3%); and the headset causing feelings of panic (n = 9, 7.4%). Side effects formed three factors: difficulties concentrating when wearing a headset, feelings of panic using VR, and worries following VR. The occurrence of side effects was not associated with number of VR sessions, therapy outcomes, or psychiatric symptoms. Difficulties concentrating in VR were associated with slightly lower satisfaction. VR therapy provision and engagement made patients feel: proud (n = 99, 81.8%); valued (n = 97, 80.2%); and optimistic (n = 96, 79.3%). Conclusions Patients with psychosis were generally very positive towards the VR therapy, valued having the opportunity to try the technology, and experienced few adverse effects. Side effects did not significantly impact VR therapy. Patient experience of VR is likely to facilitate widespread adoption.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Less is known about factors that explain these differences. We examined whether pre-, peri-, and post-trauma risk factors explained racial/ethnic differences in acute and longer-term posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety symptoms in patients hospitalized following traumatic injury or illness. Methods PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms were assessed during hospitalization and 2 and 6 months later among 1310 adult patients (6.95% Asian, 14.96% Latinx, 23.66% Black, 4.58% multiracial, and 49.85% White). Individual growth curve models examined racial/ethnic differences in PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms at each time point and in their rate of change over time, and whether pre-, peri-, and post-trauma risk factors explained these differences. Results Latinx, Black, and multiracial patients had higher acute PTSD symptoms than White patients, which remained higher 2 and 6 months post-hospitalization for Black and multiracial patients. PTSD symptoms were also found to improve faster among Latinx than White patients. Risk factors accounted for most racial/ethnic differences, although Latinx patients showed lower 6-month PTSD symptoms and Black patients lower acute and 2-month depression and anxiety symptoms after accounting for risk factors. Everyday discrimination, financial stress, past mental health problems, and social constraints were related to these differences. Conclusion Racial/ethnic differences in risk factors explained most differences in acute and longer-term PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Understanding how these risk factors relate to posttraumatic symptoms could help reduce disparities by facilitating early identification of patients at risk for mental health problems.

Methods We searched MEDLINE, PsychINFO and EMBASE between 01/01/1980 and 13/05/2021 for studies comparing regional brain glucose metabolism using 18FDG-PET, in schizophrenia/first-episode psychosis v. controls. Effect sizes (Hedges g) were pooled using a random-effects model. Primary measures were regional absolute and relative CMRGlu in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital lobes, basal ganglia and thalamus. Results Thirty-six studies (1335 subjects) were included. Frontal absolute glucose metabolism (Hedge's g = -0.74 ± 0.54, p = 0.01; I2 = 67%) and metabolism relative to whole brain (g = -0.44 ± 0.34, p = 0.01; I2 = 55%) were lower in schizophrenia v. controls with moderate heterogeneity. Absolute frontal metabolism was lower in chronic (g = -1.18 ± 0.73) v. first-episode patients (g = -0.09 ± 0.88) and controls. Medicated patients showed frontal hypometabolism relative to controls (-1.04 ± 0.26) while metabolism in drug-free patients did not differ significantly from controls. There were no differences in parietal, temporal or occipital lobe or thalamic metabolism in schizophrenia v. controls. Excluding outliers, absolute basal ganglia metabolism was lower in schizophrenia v. controls (-0.25 ± 0.24, p = 0.049; I2 = 5%). Studies identified reporting voxel-based morphometry measures of absolute 18FDG uptake (eight studies) were also analysed using signed differential mapping analysis, finding lower 18FDG uptake in the left anterior cingulate gyrus (Z = -4.143; p = 0.007) and the left inferior orbital frontal gyrus (Z = -4.239; p = 0.02) in schizophrenia. Conclusions We report evidence for hypometabolism with large effect sizes in the frontal cortex in schizophrenia without consistent evidence for alterations in other brain regions.

Discrete-time survival analysis has several benefits and multilevel survival analysis can incorporate frailty terms (random effects) to estimate the components of the biometric model. In the current study, we investigated associations between SLEs and depression risk in a population-based twin sample (N = 2299). Methods A co-twin control design was used to investigate the influence of the occurrence of SLEs on depression risk. The co-twin control design involves comparing patterns of associations in the full sample and within dizygotic (DZ) and monozygotic twins (MZ). Associations were modelled using discrete-time survival analysis with biometric frailty terms. Data from two time points were used in the analyses. Mean age at Wave 1 was 28 years and mean age at Wave 2 was 38 years. Results SLE occurrence was associated with increased depression risk. Co-twin control analyses indicated that this association was at least in part due to the causal influence of SLE exposure on depression risk for event occurrence across all SLEs and for violent SLEs. A minor proportion of the total genetic risk of depression reflected genetic effects related to SLEs. Conclusions The results support previous research in implicating SLEs as important risk factors with probable causal influence on depression risk.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

However, diffusion tensor imaging studies in biological relatives have presented contradicting results on WM alterations and their potential as biomarkers for vulnerability or resilience. To shed more light on associations between WM microstructure and resilience to familial risk, analyses including both healthy and depressed relatives of MDD patients are needed. Methods In a 2 (MDD v. healthy controls, HC) × 2 (familial risk yes v. no) design, we investigated fractional anisotropy (FA) via tract-based spatial statistics in a large well-characterised adult sample (N = 528), with additional controls for childhood maltreatment, a potentially confounding proxy for environmental risk. Results Analyses revealed a significant main effect of diagnosis on FA in the forceps minor and the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (ptfce-FWE = 0.009). Furthermore, a significant interaction of diagnosis with familial risk emerged (ptfce-FWE = 0.036) Post-hoc pairwise comparisons showed significantly higher FA, mainly in the forceps minor and right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, in HC with as compared to HC without familial risk (ptfce-FWE < 0.001), whereas familial risk played no role in MDD patients (ptfce-FWE = 0.797). Adding childhood maltreatment as a covariate, the interaction effect remained stable. Conclusions We found widespread increased FA in HC with familial risk for MDD as compared to a HC low-risk sample. The significant effect of risk on FA was present only in HC, but not in the MDD sample. These alterations might reflect compensatory neural mechanisms in healthy adults at risk for MDD potentially associated with resilience.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This review aimed to determine whether there are identifiable risk-thresholds between the frequency of cannabis use and psychosis development. Methods Systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science for relevant studies (1 January 2010-26 April 2021). Case-control or cohort studies that investigated the relationship between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis development that reported effect estimates [odds ratios (OR), hazard ratios (HR), risk ratios (RR)] or the raw data to calculate them, with information on the frequency of cannabis consumption were included. Effect estimates were extracted from individual studies and converted to RR. Two-stage dose-response multivariable meta-analytic models were utilized and sensitivity analyses conducted. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. Results Ten original (three cohorts, seven case-control) studies were included, including 7390 participants with an age range of 12-65 years. Random-effect model meta-analyses showed a significant log-linear dose-response association between cannabis use frequency and psychosis development. A restricted cubic-splines model provided the best fit for the data, with the risk of psychosis significantly increasing for weekly or more frequent cannabis use [RR = 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.11 yearly; RR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.97-1.25 monthly; RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.19-1.52 weekly; RR = 1.76, 95% CI 1.47-2.12 daily] Conclusion Individuals using cannabis frequently are at increased risk of psychosis, with no significant risk associated with less frequent use. Public health prevention messages should convey these risk-thresholds, which should be refined through further work.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods This study evaluated whether the psychometric properties of a short-form version, DISC-Ultra Short (DISCUS) (11-item), could be replicated in a sample of people with a wide range of mental disorders from 21 sites in 15 countries/territories, across six global regions. The frequency of experienced discrimination was reported. Scaling assumptions (confirmatory factor analysis, inter-item and item-total correlations), reliability (internal consistency) and validity (convergent validity, known groups method) were investigated in each region, and by diagnosis group. Results 1195 people participated. The most frequently reported experiences of discrimination were being shunned or avoided at work (48.7%) and discrimination in making or keeping friends (47.2%). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a unidimensional model across all six regions and five diagnosis groups. Convergent validity was confirmed in the total sample and within all regions [ Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI-10): 0.28-0.67, stopping self: 0.54-0.72, stigma consciousness: -0.32-0.57], as was internal consistency reliability (α = 0.74-0.84). Known groups validity was established in the global sample with levels of experienced discrimination significantly higher for those experiencing higher depression [Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2: p < 0.001], lower mental wellbeing [Warwick-Edinburgh Well-being Scale (WEMWBS): p < 0.001], higher suicidal ideation [Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)-4: p < 0.001] and higher risk of suicidal behaviour [Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS): p < 0.001]. Conclusions The DISCUS is a reliable and valid unidimensional measure of experienced discrimination for use in global settings with similar properties to the longer DISC. It offers a brief assessment of experienced discrimination for use in clinical and research settings.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Only few studies embrace an extensive examination of tobacco influence on clinical, cognitive and therapeutic characteristics in stabilized SZ outpatients. The objective of the present study was to assess the association between cognitive performances and smoking status in SZ subjects. Methods In total, 1233 SZ participants (73.9% men, mean age 31.5) were included and tested with a comprehensive battery. Tobacco status was self-declared (never-, ex-, or current smokers). Multivariable analyses including principal component analyses (PCA) were used. Results In total, 53.7% were smokers with 33.7% of them nicotine-dependent. Multiple factor analysis revealed that current tobacco smoking was associated with impaired general intellectual ability and abstract reasoning (aOR 0.60, 95% IC 0.41-0.88, p = 0.01) and with a lifetime alcohol use disorder (p = 0.026) and a lifetime cannabis use disorder (p < 0.001). Ex- and never-smokers differed for age, mean outcome, cannabis history and medication [ex-smokers being older (p = 0.047), likely to have higher income (p = 0.026), a lifetime cannabis use disorder (p < 0.001) and higher CPZeq doses (p = 0.005)]. Premorbid IQ in the three groups significantly differed with, from higher to lower: ex-smokers, never-smoker, current smokers (all p < 0.001). Conclusions This study is the largest to date providing strong evidence that chronic smoking is associated with cognitive impairment in SZ, arguing against the self-medication hypothesis as a contributor to the high prevalence of smoking in SZ. Ex-smokers may also represent a specific subgroup. Longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the developmental impact of tobacco on neurocognition. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, this scenario may have been aggravated. Thus, the objective of the current study was to evaluate changes in the suicide risk rate from the period before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the factors associated with this outcome among Brazilian undergraduate students. Methods This was a nationwide survey carried out in Brazil with a cross-sectional design, including two data collection periods: a single-center in-person collection in 2019 and another multicenter online collection in 2020/2021. Data were collected using self-administered instruments. The outcome was a high risk of suicide, measured through the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Analyses were carried out on data from two periods, i.e. before and during the pandemic (bivariate analysis and interaction tests), and a model of associated factors (multivariate analysis using Poisson regression) was developed including all participating universities distributed in the five regions of Brazil. Results In total, 6716 Brazilian undergraduate students participated (996 in 2019 and 5720 in 2020/2021). The prevalence of a high suicide risk rose from 11.3% to 17.0%, especially among women and poorer individuals. The prevalence of a high risk of suicide among Brazilian undergraduates was 19.6% and was associated with several socioeconomic, academic, pandemic, and mental health factors. Conclusions The prevalence of a high suicide risk increased from prepandemic to during the pandemic, appearing to be largely influenced by social determinants, in conjunction with the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Coordination between the thalamus and cortex is necessary for efficient processing of sensory information and appears disrupted in schizophrenia. The significance of this disrupted coordination (i.e. thalamocortical dysconnectivity) to the symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia is unclear. It is also unknown whether similar dysconnectivity is observed in other forms of psychotic psychopathology and associated with familial risk for psychosis. Here we examine the relevance of thalamocortical connectivity to the clinical symptoms and cognition of patients with psychotic psychopathology, their first-degree biological relatives, and a group of healthy controls. Method. Patients with a schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis (N = 100) or bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis (N = 33), their first-degree relatives (N = 73), and a group of healthy controls (N = 43) underwent resting functional MRI in addition to clinical and cognitive assessments as part of the Psychosis Human Connectome Project. A bilateral mediodorsal thalamus seed-based analysis was used to measure thalamocortical connectivity and test for group differences, as well as associations with symptomatology and cognition. Results. Reduced connectivity from mediodorsal thalamus to insular, orbitofrontal, and cerebellar regions was seen in schizophrenia. Across groups, greater symptomatology was related to less thalamocortical connectivity to the left middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, right insula, and cerebellum. Poorer cognition was related to less thalamocortical connectivity to bilateral insula. Analyses revealed similar patterns of dysconnectivity across patient groups and their relatives. Conclusions. Reduced thalamo-prefrontal-cerebellar and thalamo-insular connectivity may contribute to clinical symptomatology and cognitive deficits in patients with psychosis as well as individuals with familial risk for psychotic psychopathology. © The Author(s), 2022.

However, it is unclear whether this increased risk propensity in real-life contexts translates into a generally increased attitude towards risk. We aimed to assess decision-making under risk and ambiguity based on prospect theory by considering the effects of comorbidities and medication. Methods Fifty-four individuals with TS and 32 healthy controls performed risk and ambiguity decision-making tasks under both gains and losses conditions. Behavioural and computational parameters were evaluated using (i) univariate analysis to determine parameters difference taking independently; (ii) supervised multivariate analysis to evaluate whether our parameters could jointly account for between-group differences (iii) unsupervised multivariate analysis to explore the potential presence of sub-groups. Results Except for general 'noisier' (less consistent) decisions in TS, we showed no specific risk-taking behaviour in TS or any relation with tics severity or antipsychotic medication. However, the presence of comorbidities was associated with distortion of decision-making. Specifically, TS with obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbidity was associated with a higher risk-taking profile to increase gain and a higher risk-averse profile to decrease loss. TS with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder comorbidity was associated with risk-seeking in the ambiguity context to reduce a potential loss. Conclusions Impaired valuation of risk and ambiguity was not related to TS per se. Our findings are important for clinical practice: the involvement of individuals with TS in real-life risky situations may actually rather result from other factors such as psychiatric comorbidities.

Studying how fear conditioning and extinction constructs relate to anxiety symptoms and reactivity to stressful and benign moments in everyday life provides a powerful addition to experimental paradigms. Method Fifty-one young adults completed laboratory-based differential conditioning and extinction tasks with (CS +) and without (CS-) an aversive unconditional stimulus (US). Electrodermal skin conductance responses were measured during each phase, followed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) tapping anxiety and stressors six times daily for seven days (2, 142 moments). Results Conditioned electrodermal reactivity to the CS + and overgeneralisation to the CS- were associated with greater change in anxiety (measured via EMA), across non-stressful situations, remaining the same across stressful situations. Likewise, during extinction when the CS + is now safe, more electrodermal reactivity to the CS + was associated with more anxiety change across non-stressful situations and remained the same across stressful situations. Also, during extinction when threat is absent, more electrodermal reactivity at the late stage of the CS- was associated with less momentary anxiety change in response to stressful situations; more electrodermal activity at the late stage of the CS + was associated with more anxiety change across non-stressful situations and remained the same across stressful situations. Conclusions Sampling 'in vivo' emotion and stress experiences, study findings revealed links between conditioned electrodermal reactivity and overgeneralisation to safe stimuli and heightened anxious reactivity during non-stressful (i.e. safe) moments in daily life, coupled with less change in response to actual stressors.

Based on the influential 'triple-network model' of ADHD, this prospective longitudinal investigation aimed to (i) assess the effect of childhood TBI on brain morphometry of higher-order cognitive networks proposed to play a key role in ADHD pathophysiology, including the default-mode network (DMN), salience network (SN) and central executive network (CEN); and (ii) assess the independent prognostic value of DMN, SN and CEN morphometry in predicting s-ADHD symptom severity after childhood TBI. Methods The study sample comprised 155 participants, including 112 children with medically confirmed mild-severe TBI ascertained from consecutive hospital admissions, and 43 typically developing (TD) children matched for age, sex and socio-economic status. High-resolution structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences were acquired sub-acutely in a subset of 103 children with TBI and 34 TD children. Parents completed well-validated measures of ADHD symptom severity at 12-months post injury. Results Relative to TD children and those with milder levels of TBI severity (mild, complicated mild, moderate), children with severe TBI showed altered brain morphometry within large-scale, higher-order cognitive networks, including significantly diminished grey matter volumes within the DMN, SN and CEN. When compared with the TD group, the TBI group showed significantly higher ADHD symptomatology and higher rates of clinically elevated symptoms. In multivariable models adjusted for other well-established risk factors, altered DMN morphometry independently predicted higher s-ADHD symptomatology at 12-months post-injury, whilst SN and CEN morphometry were not significant independent predictors. Conclusions Our prospective study findings suggest that neurostructural alterations within higher-order cognitive circuitry may represent a prospective risk factor for s-ADHD symptomatology at 12-months post-injury in children with TBI. High-resolution structural brain MRI has potential to provide early prognostic biomarkers that may help early identification of high-risk children with TBI who are likely to benefit from early surveillance and preventive measures to optimise long-term neuropsychiatric outcomes.

However, examining trust behavior in an experimental setting is challenging. Investigators have used the trust game, a neuro-economic game to assess trust behavior in psychosis. However, the findings are inconsistent. Hence, we systematically reviewed the existing literature and conducted a meta-analysis to examine trust behavior in patients with psychosis, their relatives, and those at high risk for psychosis. Methods We searched electronic databases for studies that have examined trust game in patients with psychosis, published up to November 2021. The primary outcome measure was the baseline trust in a trust game by patients and controls. The meta-analysis was performed if at least three data sets of control and patient groups were available for that measure/design. We conducted meta-analyses with a random-effects model. The results were described narratively wherever meta-analysis was not possible due to paucity of studies. Results The searches across the databases including cross-references yielded 465 publications of which 10 studies were included in the final analysis. Baseline trust in the trust game was significantly lower in patients with psychosis compared to controls (SMD 0.39, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.64, p -0.002). However, a similar decrease in baseline trust was not present in relatives of patients (SMD 0.08, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.36, p -0.58). Conclusions The current meta-analysis suggests significant trust deficits in patients with psychosis. Future studies with a bigger sample size are required to understand the nature of trust deficits and factors affecting this impairment. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Studying these characteristics together and prospectively within a population confronted with high stressor exposure (e.g. U.S. Army soldiers) has not been done, yet could uncover unique and interactive predictive effects that may inform prevention and early intervention efforts. Methods Five broad personality traits and social network size were assessed via self-administered questionnaires among experienced soldiers preparing for deployment (N = 4645) and new soldiers reporting for basic training (N = 6216). Predictive models examined associations of baseline personality and social network variables with recent distress disorders or suicidal behaviors assessed 3- and 9-months post-deployment and approximately 5 years following enlistment. Results Among the personality traits, elevated neuroticism was consistently associated with increased mental health risk following deployment. Small social networks were also associated with increased mental health risk following deployment, beyond the variance accounted for by personality. Limited support was found for social network size moderating the association between personality and mental health outcomes. Small social networks also predicted distress disorders and suicidal behavior 5 years following enlistment, whereas unique effects of personality traits on these more distal outcomes were rare. Conclusions Heightened neuroticism and small social networks predict a greater risk for negative mental health sequelae, especially following deployment. Social ties may mitigate adverse impacts of personality traits on psychopathology in some contexts. Early identification and targeted intervention for these distinct, modifiable factors may decrease the risk of distress disorders and suicidal behavior.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Attempts to clarify their origin have been hampered by a lack of rigorous research designs. We sought to clarify the etiology of the FSD by examining the genetic risk patterns for FSD and other related disorders. Methods This study was performed in 5 829 186 individuals from Swedish national registers. We quantified familial genetic risk for FSD, internalizing disorders, and somatic disorders in cases of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia (FM), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), using a novel method based on aggregate risk in first to fifth degree relatives, adjusting for cohabitation. We compared these profiles with those of a prototypic internalizing psychiatric - major depression (MD) - and a somatic/autoimmune disorder: rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Results Patients with FM carry substantial genetic risks not only for FM, but also for pain syndromes and internalizing, autoimmune and sleep disorders. The genetic risk profiles for IBS and CFS are also widely distributed although with lower average risks. By contrast, genetic risk profiles of MD and RA are much more restricted to related conditions. Conclusion Patients with FM have a relatively unique family genetic risk score profile with elevated genetic risk across a range of disorders that differs markedly from the profiles of a classic autoimmune disorder (RA) and internalizing disorder (MD). A similar less marked pattern of genetic risks was seen for IBS and CFS. FSD arise from a distinctive pattern of genetic liability for a diversity of psychiatric, autoimmune, pain, sleep, and functional somatic disorders.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

To this end, this study investigated the association between accelerated or delayed age-related brain structural changes and cognition in early-stage BDI. Methods First episode patients with BDI (n = 80) underwent cognitive assessment to yield demographically normed composite global and domain-specific scores in verbal memory, non-verbal memory, working memory, processing speed, attention, and executive functioning. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data were also collected from all participants and subjected to machine learning to compute the brain-predicted age difference (brainPAD), calculated by subtracting chronological age from age predicted by neuroimaging data (positive brainPAD values indicating age-related acceleration in brain structural changes and negative values indicating delay). Patients were divided into tertiles based on brainPAD values, and cognitive performance compared amongst tertiles with ANCOVA. Results Patients in the lowest (delayed) tertile of brainPAD values (brainPAD range -17.9 to -6.5 years) had significantly lower global cognitive scores (p = 0.025) compared to patients in the age-congruent tertile (brainPAD range -5.3 to 2.4 yrs), and significantly lower verbal memory scores (p = 0.001) compared to the age-congruent and accelerated (brainPAD range 2.8 to 16.1 yrs) tertiles. Conclusion These results provide evidence linking cognitive dysfunction in the early stage of BDI to apparent delay in typical age-related brain changes. Further studies are required to assess how age-related brain changes and cognitive functioning evolve over time.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in particular has been hampered by a high relapse rate. Because relapse can be due to conditions associated with tobacco consumption (such as drinking in bars with friends), virtual reality cue exposure therapy (VRCE) can be a potential tool to generate 3D interactive environments that simulate risk situations for relapse prevention procedures. Methods To assess the effectiveness of VRCE with CBT, a comparative trial involving 100 smoking abstinent participants was designed with all required virtual environments (VE) created with an inexpensive graphic engine/game level editor. Results Outcome measures confirmed the immersive and craving eliciting effect of these VEs. Results demonstrated that more participants in the VRCE group did not experience smoking relapse and that VRCE is at least as efficacious as traditional CBT in terms of craving reduction and decrease in nicotine dependence. Dropout and relapse rate in the VRCE group was noticeably lower than the CBT group. Aside from mood scores, no significant differences were found regarding the other scales. Conclusion The present clinical trial provides evidence that VRCE was effective in preventing smoking relapse.

We know too little about SIP incidence over time and across countries, including substance-specific SIPs. We estimated annual incidence rate of SIP in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden according to substance, age, gender, and socioeconomic background. Methods Data were drawn from registries covering the whole adult population in the countries. Annual incidence rate per 100 000 persons of SIPs was estimated for Denmark and Sweden from 2000 to 2016 and for Norway from 2010 to 2015. Results The annual incidence rate of any SIP fluctuated between 9.3 and 14.1. The most commonly occurring SIPs were those induced by alcohol, cannabis, amphetamines, and multiple substances. There was a steady decrease in the incidence rate of alcohol-induced psychosis from the first to the last year of the observation period in Denmark (from 4.9 to 1.5) and Sweden (from 4.5 to 2.2). The incidence rate of cannabis-induced psychosis increased in all countries, from 2.6 to 5.6 in Denmark, from 0.8 to 2.7 in Sweden, and from 1.8 to 3.0 in Norway. Median age of any SIP decreased in Denmark (from 36 to 29 years) and Sweden (from 41 to 31 years). Incidence rates were higher in men and in individuals on disability pension, and increased more among those with high parental education. Conclusions We found similar and stable incidence rates of any SIP in all Scandinavian countries through the observation period. The incidence of alcohol-induced psychosis decreased.

Methods Offspring (born 1960-1995) and their biological parents from three family types [not-lived-with (NLW) biological father, mother and adoptive] and their AUD and DUD diagnoses were ascertained from Swedish national registers. Parent-offspring resemblance was calculated by tetrachoric correlation. Results In Swedes born from 1960 to 1995, prevalence rates of AUD were stable while DUD rates increased substantially. Best-estimate tetrachoric correlations (±95% confidence intervals) between AUD in biological parents and AUD and DUD in their offspring were, respectively, +0.19 (0.18-0.20) and +0.18 (0.17-0.20). Parallel results from DUD in parents to AUD and DUD in children were +0.12 (0.10-0.13) and +0.27 (0.26-0.28). When divided into older and younger cohorts, the specificity of DUD transmission increased substantially over time, while the genetic correlation between AUD and DUD significantly decreased. Conclusions Raised when alcohol was the preferred substance of abuse and illicit drugs highly stigmatized, AUD in parents reflected a general liability to substance use disorders, as they transmitted similar genetic risk for AUD and DUD to their children raised when both substances were widely available and relatively acceptable. DUD in parents, by contrast, reflected a more specific liability to DUD and, when transmitted to offspring, produced a considerably stronger risk for DUD than for AUD that increased over time.

We investigated the feasibility of creating a baseline model to determine which of these would be among patients beginning ADM treatment in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Methods A 2018-2020 national sample of n = 660 VHA patients receiving ADM treatment for MDD completed an extensive baseline self-report assessment near the beginning of treatment and a 3-month self-report follow-up assessment. Using baseline self-report data along with administrative and geospatial data, an ensemble machine learning method was used to develop a model for 3-month treatment response defined by the Quick Inventory of Depression Symptomatology Self-Report and a modified Sheehan Disability Scale. The model was developed in a 70% training sample and tested in the remaining 30% test sample. Results In total, 35.7% of patients responded to treatment. The prediction model had an area under the ROC curve (s.e.) of 0.66 (0.04) in the test sample. A strong gradient in probability (s.e.) of treatment response was found across three subsamples of the test sample using training sample thresholds for high [45.6% (5.5)], intermediate [34.5% (7.6)], and low [11.1% (4.9)] probabilities of response. Baseline symptom severity, comorbidity, treatment characteristics (expectations, history, and aspects of current treatment), and protective/resilience factors were the most important predictors. Conclusions Although these results are promising, parallel models to predict response to alternative treatments based on data collected before initiating treatment would be needed for such models to help guide treatment selection.

Besides chronic low-grade inflammation, CM might also affect the energy production of cells by altering the function and density of mitochondria, i.e. the body's main energy suppliers. Here, we compared mitochondrial respiration and density in intact peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), from women with and without CM between two time points, i.e. at the highly inflammatory phase within 1 week after parturition (t0) and again after 1 year (t2). Methods CM exposure was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Whole blood was collected from n = 52 healthy women within the study 'My Childhood - Your Childhood' at both time points to isolate and cryopreserve PBMC. Thawed PBMC were used to measure mitochondrial respiration and density by high-resolution respirometry followed by spectrophotometric analyses of citrate-synthase activity. Results Over time, quantitative respiratory parameters increased, while qualitative flux control ratios decreased, independently of CM. Women with CM showed higher mitochondrial respiration and density at t0, but not at t2. We found significant CM group × time interaction effects for ATP-turnover-related respiration and mitochondrial density. Conclusions This is the first study to longitudinally investigate mitochondrial bioenergetics in postpartum women with and without CM. Our results indicate that CM-related mitochondrial alterations reflect allostatic load, probably due to higher inflammatory states during parturition, which normalize later. However, later inflammatory states might moderate the vulnerability for a second-hit on the level of mitochondrial bioenergetics, at least in immune cells.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

One reason might be that prior tasks of cognitive effort-based decision-making are limited by potential confounds such as physical effort and temporal delay discounting. Methods To address these interpretive challenges, we developed a new task - the Cognitive Effort Motivation Task - to assess one's willingness to exert cognitive effort for rewards. Cognitive effort was manipulated by varying the number of items (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) kept in spatial working memory. Twenty-six depressed patients and 44 healthy controls went through an extensive learning session where they experienced each possible effort level 10 times. They were then asked to make a series of choices between performing a fixed low-effort-low-reward or variable higher-effort-higher-reward option during the task. Results Both groups found the task more cognitively (but not physically) effortful when effort level increased, but they still achieved ≥80% accuracy on each effort level during training and >95% overall accuracy during the actual task. Computational modelling revealed that a parabolic model best accounted for subjects' data, indicating that higher-effort levels had a greater impact on devaluing rewards than lower levels. These procedures also revealed that MDD patients discounted rewards more steeply by effort and were less willing to exert cognitive effort for rewards compared to healthy participants. Conclusions These findings provide empirical evidence to show, without confounds of other variables, that depressed patients have impaired cognitive effort motivation compared to the general population.

There are gender differences in depression and vitamin D level. However, the relationship between depression, gender, vitamin D, cognition, and brain function has yet to be determined. Methods One hundred and twenty-two patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 119 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional MRI and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) was calculated to assess brain function. Serum concentration of vitamin D (SCVD) and cognition (i.e. prospective memory and sustained attention) were also measured. Results We found a significant group-by-gender interaction effect on SCVD whereby MDD patients showed a reduction in SCVD relative to controls in females but not males. Concurrently, there was a female-specific association of SCVD with cognition and MDD-related fALFF alterations in widespread brain regions. Remarkably, MDD- and SCVD-related fALFF changes mediated the relation between SCVD and cognition in females. Conclusion Apart from providing insights into the neural mechanisms by which low vitamin D contributes to cognitive impairment in MDD in a gender-dependent manner, these findings might have clinical implications for assignment of female patients with MDD and cognitive dysfunction to adjuvant vitamin D supplementation therapy, which may ultimately advance a precision approach to personalized antidepressant choice.

Here, we explored whether these group differences relate to resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) patterns of brain areas previously linked to both attention processes and PTSD. These encompass the amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Methods Ten minutes magnetic resonance imaging rsFC scans were recorded in 17 PTSD patients, 21 TEHCs, and 16 HCs. Participants then completed a free-viewing eye-tracking task assessing attention allocation outside the scanner. Dwell time on negatively-valenced stimuli (DT%) were assessed relative to functional connectivity in the aforementioned seed regions of interest (amygdala, dACC, dlPFC, vlPFC, and NAcc) to whole-brain voxel-wise rsFC. Results As previously reported, group differences occurred in attention allocation to negative-valence stimuli, with longer dwell time on negatively valence stimuli in the PTSD and TEHC groups than the HC group. Higher DT% correlated with weaker NAcc-orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) connectivity in patients with PTSD. Conversely, a positive association emerged in the HC group between DT% and NAcc-OFC connectivity. Conclusions While exploratory in nature, present findings may suggest that reward-related brain areas are involved in disengaging attention from negative-valenced stimuli, and possibly in regulating ensuing negative emotions.

The relative excess of GM may indicate putative compensatory responses, though to date its relevance is unclear. Methods 343 first-episode treatment-naïve patients with schizophrenia (FES) and 342 HC were recruited. Multivariate source-based morphometry was performed to identify covarying 'networks' of grey matter concentration (GMC). Neurocognitive scores using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and symptom burden using the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS) were obtained. Bivariate linear relationships between GMC and cognition/symptoms were studied. Results Compared to healthy subjects, FES had prominently lower GMC in two components; the first consists of the anterior insula, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate and the second component with the superior temporal gyrus, precuneus, inferior/superior parietal lobule, cuneus, and lingual gyrus. Higher GMC was seen in adjacent areas of the middle and superior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, inferior parietal cortex and putamen. Greater GMC of this component was associated with lower duration of untreated psychosis, less severe positive symptoms and better performance on cognitive tests. Conclusions In untreated stages of schizophrenia, both a distributed lower and higher GMC is observable. While the higher GMC is relatively modest, it occurs across frontoparietal, temporal and subcortical regions in association with reduced illness burden suggesting a compensatory role for higher GMC in the early stages of schizophrenia.

This susceptibility is partly due to hundreds or thousands of common genetic variants, each conferring a fractional risk. The cumulative effects of the associated variants can be summarised as a polygenic risk score (PRS). Using data from the EUropean Network of national schizophrenia networks studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) first episode case-control study, we aimed to test whether PRSs for three major psychiatric disorders (SZ, BD, D) and for intelligent quotient (IQ) as a neurodevelopmental proxy, can discriminate affective psychosis (AP) from schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (SSD). Methods Participants (842 cases, 1284 controls) from 16 European EU-GEI sites were successfully genotyped following standard quality control procedures. The sample was stratified based on genomic ancestry and analyses were done only on the subsample representing the European population (573 cases, 1005 controls). Using PRS for SZ, BD, D, and IQ built from the latest available summary statistics, we performed simple or multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for 10 principal components for the different clinical comparisons. Results In case-control comparisons PRS-SZ, PRS-BD and PRS-D distributed differentially across psychotic subcategories. In case-case comparisons, both PRS-SZ [odds ratio (OR) = 0.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.92] and PRS-D (OR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.06-1.61) differentiated AP from SSD; and within AP categories, only PRS-SZ differentiated BD from psychotic depression (OR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.23-3.74). Conclusions Combining PRS for severe psychiatric disorders in prediction models for psychosis phenotypes can increase discriminative ability and improve our understanding of these phenotypes. Our results point towards the potential usefulness of PRSs in specific populations such as high-risk or early psychosis phases.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Attention bias modification (ABM), targeting perturbed threat-related attentional patterns, shows promise when delivered in-person. However, previous studies found ABM to be ineffective when delivered remotely. Randomized clinical trials usually applied two variations of ABM: ABM away from threat or attention control training (ACT) balancing attention between threat-related and neutral stimuli. We tested remotely-delivered ACT/ABM with tighter supervision and video-based interactions that resemble in-clinic protocols. We expected to replicate the results of in-clinic trials, in which ACT outperformed ABM for PTSD. Methods In this double-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial, 60 patients diagnosed with PTSD were randomized (ABM n = 30; ACT n = 30). Patients performed eight bi-weekly remotely-delivered supervised ABM/ACT sessions. Symptoms were assessed pre- and post-treatment with Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale 5 (CAPS-5) severity score and PTSD diagnosis as the primary outcomes. Current depressive episode, current anxiety-related comorbidity, and time elapsed since the trauma were examined as potential moderators of treatment outcome. Results Significant decrease in CAPS-5 severity scores and PTSD diagnosis was observed following both ACT and ABM with no between-group difference. Patients without depression or whose trauma occurred more recently had greater symptom reduction in the ACT than the ABM group. Conclusions Contrary to our expectation, symptoms decreased similarly following ACT and ABM. Moderator analyses suggest advantage for ACT in non-depressed patients and patients whose trauma occurred more recently. Further refinements in remotely-delivered ABM/ACT may be needed.

Methods An electronic literature search was conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, All EBM databases, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Meta-analyses of case-control studies investigating the polysomnographic changes in patients with neuropsychiatric diseases were included. For each meta-analysis, we estimated the summary effect size using random effects models, the 95% confidence interval, and the 95% prediction interval. We also estimated between-study heterogeneity, evidence of excess significance bias, and evidence of small-study effects. The levels of evidence of polysomnographic changes in neuropsychiatric diseases were ranked as follows: not significant, weak, suggestive, highly suggestive, or convincing. Results We identified 27 articles, including 465 case-control studies in 27 neuropsychiatric diseases. The levels of evidence of polysomnographic changes in neuropsychiatric diseases were highly suggestive for increased sleep latency and decreased sleep efficiency (SE) in major depressive disorder (MDD), increased N1 percentage, and decreased N2 percentage, SL and REML in narcolepsy, and decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep percentage in Parkinson's disease (PD). The suggestive evidence decreased REM latency in MDD, decreased total sleep time and SE in PD, and decreased SE in posttraumatic stress disorder and in narcolepsy. Conclusions The credibility of evidence for sleep characteristics in 27 neuropsychiatric diseases varied across polysomnographic variables and diseases. When considering the patterns of altered PSG variables, no two diseases had the same pattern of alterations, suggesting that specific sleep profiles might be important dimensions for defining distinct neuropsychiatric disorders.

This study examined the incidence of suicide attempt and violent crime following hospital contact for TBI in a nationwide cohort study. Methods We used nationwide register data covering all individuals aged 10+ living in Denmark during 1980-2016 (n = 7 783 951). Of these, 587 522 individuals had a hospital contact for TBI. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were calculated by Poisson regression analyses while adjusted for relevant covariates including other fractures and psychiatric diagnoses. Results Individuals with TBI had higher rates of suicide attempt (females IRR, 2.78; 95% CI 2.71-2.85; males IRR, 3.00; 95% CI 2.93-3.08) compared to individuals without TBI in adjusted analyses. Multiple TBI and temporal proximity to TBI were associated with higher rates of suicide attempt. Individuals with TBI had higher rates of violent crime (females IRR, 2.43; 95% CI 2.36-2.49; males IRR, 1.80, 95% CI 1.78-1.82) compared with individuals without TBI. Higher rates of violent crime were found after multiple TBI and temporal proximity to TBI. Conclusions This nationwide cohort study found higher rates of suicide attempt and violent crime among individuals with prior hospital diagnosed TBI, compared with individuals without TBI. This emphasises the need for preventive efforts immediately after TBI diagnosis, which might mitigate the risks of a trajectory toward suicidal or violent behaviours.

Here, we examined the contribution of fronto-limbic effective connectivity (EC) to the longitudinal stability of emotion-related impulsivity, a key feature of BPD, in symptomatic adolescents and young adults. Methods We compared resting-state EC in 82 adolescents and emerging adults with and without clinically significant borderline symptoms (n BPD = 40, ages 13-30). Group-specific directed networks were estimated amongst fronto-limbic nodes including PFC, ventral striatum (VS), central amygdala (CeN), and basolateral amygdala (BLA). We examined the association of directed centrality metrics with initial levels and rates of change in emotion-related impulsivity symptoms over a one-year follow-up using latent growth curve models (LGCMs). Results In controls, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsal ACC had a directed influence on CeN and VS, respectively. In the BPD group, bilateral BLA had a directed influence on CeN, whereas in the healthy group CeN influenced BLA. LGCMs indicated that emotion-related impulsivity was stable across a one-year follow-up in the BPD group. Further, higher EC of R CeN to other regions in controls was associated with stronger within-person decreases in emotion-related impulsivity. Conclusions Functional inputs from BLA and vmPFC appear to play competing roles in influencing CeN activity. In borderline adolescents and young adults, BLA may predominate over CeN activity, while in controls the ability of CeN to influence BLA activity predicted more rapid reductions in emotion-related impulsivity.

We aimed to determine the association of bullying victimisation with suicide mortality. Methods Participants were drawn from the 1958 British birth cohort, a prospective follow-up of all births in 1 week in Britain in 1958. We conducted logistic regressions on 14 946 participants whose mothers reported bullying victimisation at 7 and 11 years with linked information on suicide deaths through the National Health Service Central Register. Results Fifty-five participants (48 males) had died by suicide between the age 18 and 52 years. Bullying victimisation was associated with suicide mortality; a one standard deviation increases in bullying victimisation linked to an increased odds for suicide mortality [odds ratio (OR) 1.29; 1.02-1.64] during adulthood. The OR attenuated by 11% after adjustment for individual (e.g. behavioural and emotional problems) and familial characteristics (e.g. adverse childhood experiences, 1.18; 0.92-1.51). Analysis of bullying victimisation frequency categories yields similar results: compared with individuals who had not been bullied, those who had been frequently bullied had an increased odds for suicide mortality (OR 1.89; 0.99-3.62). Conclusion Our study suggests that individuals who have been frequently bullied have a small increased risk of dying by suicide, when no other risk factors is considered. Suicide prevention might start in childhood, with bullying included in a range of inter-correlated vulnerabilities encompassing behavioural and emotional difficulties and adverse experiences within the family.

The authors examined the associations between distress prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent risk of hospitalization. Methods Between April 2020 (baseline) and April 2021, we followed 54 781 participants from three ongoing cohorts: Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), Nurses' Health Study 3 (NHS3), and the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) who reported no current or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection at baseline. Chronic depression was assessed during 2010-2019. Depression, anxiety, worry about COVID-19, perceived stress, and loneliness were measured at baseline. SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization due to COVID-19 was self-reported. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by Poisson regression. Results 3663 participants reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test (mean age = 55.0 years, standard deviation = 13.8) during follow-up. Among these participants, chronic depression prior to the pandemic [RR = 1.72; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-2.46], and probable depression (RR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.08-3.03), being very worried about COVID-19 (RR = 1.79; 95% CI 1.12-2.86), and loneliness (RR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.02-3.20) reported at baseline were each associated with subsequent COVID-19 hospitalization, adjusting for demographic factors and healthcare worker status. Anxiety and perceived stress were not associated with hospitalization. Depression, worry about COVID-19, and loneliness were as strongly associated with hospitalization as were high cholesterol and hypertension, established risk factors for COVID-19 severity. Conclusions Psychological distress may be a risk factor for hospitalization in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assessment of psychological distress may identify patients at greater risk of hospitalization. Future work should examine whether addressing distress improves physical health outcomes.

Aerobic exercise is hypothesized to increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and thereby synaptic plasticity, leading to increased learning capacity. Systematic CT should take advantage of increased learning capacity and be more effective when combined with aerobic exercise. Methods We examined the impact of a 6-month program of cognitive training & exercise (CT&E) compared to cognitive training alone (CT) in 47 first-episode schizophrenia outpatients. All participants were provided the same Posit Science computerized CT, 4 h/week, using BrainHQ and SocialVille programs. The CT&E group also participated in total body circuit training exercises to enhance aerobic conditioning. Clinic and home-based exercise were combined for a target of 150 min per week. Results The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery Overall Composite improved significantly more with CT&E than with CT alone (p = 0.04), particularly in the first 3 months (6.5 v. 2.2 T-score points, p < 0.02). Work/school functioning improved substantially more with CT&E than with CT alone by 6 months (p < 0.001). BDNF gain tended to predict the amount of cognitive gain but did not reach significance. The cognitive gain by 3 months predicted the amount of work/school functioning improvement at 6 months. The amount of exercise completed was strongly associated with the degree of cognitive and work/school functioning improvement. Conclusions Aerobic exercise significantly enhances the impact of CT on cognition and functional outcome in first-episode schizophrenia, apparently driven by the amount of exercise completed.

We investigated whether sex had a similar effect on developmental domains amongst boys and girls with a familial risk of schizophrenia (FHR-SZ), bipolar disorder (FHR-BP), and controls. Methods Through Danish registries, we identified 522 7-year-old children (242 girls) with FHR-SZ, FHR-BP, and controls. We assessed their performance within the domains of neurocognition, motor function, language, social cognition, social behavior, psychopathology, and home environment. Results FHR-SZ boys compared with FHR-SZ girls had a higher proportion of disruptive behavior and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and exhibited lower performance in manual dexterity, balance, and emotion recognition. No sex differences were found between boys and girls within FHR-BP group. Compared with controls, both FHR-SZ boys and FHR-SZ girls showed impaired processing speed and working memory, had lower levels of global functioning, and were more likely to live in an inadequate home environment. Compared with control boys, FHR-SZ boys showed impaired manual dexterity, social behavior, and social responsiveness, and had a higher proportion of ADHD and disruptive behavior disorder diagnoses. Stress and adjustment disorders were more common in FHR-BP boys compared with control boys. We found no differences between FHR-BP girls and control girls. Conclusions Impairment within neurodevelopmental domains associated within FHR-SZ boys v. FHR-SZ girls was most evident among boys, whereas no sex differences were found within the FHR-BP group (FHR-BP boys v. FHR-BP girls). FHR-SZ boys exhibited the highest proportion of early developmental impairments.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Correlational evidence has connected sleep and insomnia to resilience; however, this relationship has not yet been experimentally tested. This study examined resilience as a mediator of treatment outcomes in a randomized clinical trial with insomnia patients. Methods Participants were randomized to either digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I; n = 358) or sleep education control (n = 300), and assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-year follow-up. A structural equation modeling framework was utilized to test resilience as a mediator of insomnia and depression. Risk for insomnia and depression was also tested in the model, operationalized as a latent factor with sleep reactivity, stress, and rumination as indicators (aligned with the 3-P model). Sensitivity analyses tested the impact of change in resilience on the insomnia relapse and incident depression at 1-year follow-up. Results dCBT-I resulted in greater improvements in resilience compared to the sleep education control. Furthermore, improved resilience following dCBT-I lowered latent risk, which was further associated with reduced insomnia and depression at 1-year follow-up. Sensitivity analyses indicated that each point improvement in resilience following treatment reduced the odds of insomnia relapse and incident depression 1 year later by 76% and 65%, respectively. Conclusions Improved resilience is likely a contributing mechanism to treatment gains following insomnia therapy, which may then reduce longer-term risk for insomnia relapse and depression.

However, much of this work has been cross-sectional, conducted in separate lines of inquiry, and focused on recent life stressor exposure, despite the fact that theories of depression posit that stressors can have cumulative effects over the lifespan. To address these limitations, we investigated whether acute and chronic stressors occurring over the lifespan interacted with blunted reward processing to predict increases in depression over time in healthy youth. Method Participants were 245 adolescent girls aged 8-14 years old (Mage = 12.4, s.d. = 1.8) who were evaluated at baseline and two years later. The reward positivity (RewP), an event-related potential measure of reward responsiveness, was assessed at baseline using the doors task. Cumulative lifetime exposure to acute and chronic stressors was assessed two years later using the Stress and Adversity Inventory for Adolescents (Adolescent STRAIN). Finally, depressive symptoms were assessed at both baseline and follow-up using the Children's Depression Inventory. Results As hypothesized, greater lifetime acute stressor exposure predicted increases in depressive symptoms over two years, but only for youth exhibiting a blunted RewP. This interaction, however, was not found for chronic stressors. Conclusions Lifetime acute stressor exposure may be particularly depressogenic for youth exhibiting a blunted RewP. Conversely, a robust RewP may be protective in the presence of greater acute lifetime stressor exposure.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We used data from its participants to analyze mortality, survival, and causes of death associated with mental disorders. Methods Our exposures were mental disorders identified using (1) symptom-based outcomes derived from an online Mental Health Questionnaire (n = 157 329), including lifetime/current depression, lifetime/current generalized anxiety disorder, lifetime/recent psychotic experience, lifetime bipolar disorder, current alcohol use disorder, and current posttraumatic stress disorder and (2) hospital data linkage of diagnoses within the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) (n = 502 422), including (A) selected diagnoses or groups of diagnoses corresponding to symptom-based outcomes and (B) all psychiatric diagnoses, grouped by ICD-10 section. For all exposures, we estimated age-adjusted mortality rates and hazard ratios, as well as proportions of deaths by cause. Results We found significantly increased mortality risk associated with all mental disorders identified by symptom-based outcomes, except for lifetime generalized anxiety disorder (with hazard ratios in the range of 1.08-3.0). We also found significantly increased mortality risk associated with all conditions identified by hospital data linkage, including selected ICD-10 diagnoses or groups of diagnoses (2.15-7.87) and ICD-10 diagnoses grouped by section (2.02-5.44). Causes of death associated with mental disorders were heterogeneous and mostly natural. Conclusions In a middle-aged cohort, we found a higher mortality risk associated with most mental disorders identified by symptom-based outcomes and with all disorders or groups of disorders identified by hospital data linkage of ICD-10 diagnoses.

Consequently, requests for medical treatments, such as puberty suppression, are growing. However, studies investigating the neurobiological substrate of gender incongruence (when birth-assigned sex and gender identity do not align) are scarce, and knowledge about the effects of puberty suppression on the developing brain of transgender youth is limited. Methods Here we cross-sectionally investigated sex and gender differences in regional fractional anisotropy (FA) as measured by diffusion MR imaging, and the impact of puberty on alterations in the white-matter organization of 35 treatment-naive prepubertal children and 41 adolescents with gender incongruence, receiving puberty suppression. The transgender groups were compared with 79 age-matched, treatment-naive cisgender (when sex and gender align) peers. Results We found that transgender adolescents had lower FA in the bilateral inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), forceps major and corpus callosum than cisgender peers. In addition, average FA values of the right IFOF correlated negatively with adolescents' cumulative dosage of puberty suppressants received. Of note, prepubertal children also showed significant FA group differences in, again, the right IFOF and left cortico-spinal tract, but with the reverse pattern (transgender > cisgender) than was seen in adolescents. Conclusions Importantly, our results of lower FA (indexing less longitudinal organization, fiber coherence, and myelination) in the IFOF of gender-incongruent adolescents replicate prior findings in transgender adults, suggesting a salient neural correlate of gender incongruence. Findings highlight the complexity with which (pubertal) sex hormones impact white-matter development and add important insight into the neurobiological substrate associated with gender incongruence.

Although negative emotions and emotion dysregulation are hypothesized to precede and predict LOC eating, they are rarely examined outside the self-report domain. Autonomic indices, including heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV), may provide information about stress and capacity for emotion regulation in response to stress. Methods We studied whether autonomic indices predict LOC eating in real-time in adolescents with LOC eating and body mass index (BMI) 70th percentile. Twenty-four adolescents aged 12-18 (67% female; BMI percentile mean ± standard deviation = 92.6 ± 9.4) who reported at least twice-monthly LOC episodes wore biosensors to monitor HR, HRV, and physical activity for 1 week. They reported their degree of LOC after all eating episodes on a visual analog scale (0-100) using a smartphone. Results Adjusting for physical activity and time of day, higher HR and lower HRV predicted higher self-reported LOC after eating. Parsing between- and within-subjects effects, there was a significant, positive, within-subjects association between pre-meal HR and post-meal LOC rating. However, there was no significant within-subjects effect for HRV, nor were there between-subjects effects for either electrophysiologic variable. Conclusions Findings suggest that autonomic indices may either be a marker of risk for subsequent LOC eating or contribute to LOC eating. Linking physiological markers with behavior in the natural environment can improve knowledge of illness mechanisms and provide new avenues for intervention.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

However, it remains unclear whether cognitive performances differ between individuals at high and low genetic risks for SCZ or BD. Methods Using the latest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) data, we calculated PGC3 SCZ-, PGC3 BD-, and SCZ v. BD polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in 173 SCZ patients, 70 unaffected first-degree relatives (FRs) and 196 healthy controls (HCs). Based on combinations of three PRS deciles, individuals in the genetic SCZ, genetic BD and low genetic risk groups were extracted. Cognitive performance was assessed by the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia. Results SCZ-, BD-, SCZ v. BD-PRSs were associated with case-control status (R2 = 0.020-0.061), and SCZ-PRS was associated with relative-control status (R2 = 0.023). Furthermore, individuals in the highest decile for SCZ PRSs had elevated BD-PRSs [odds ratio (OR) = 6.33] and SCZ v. BD-PRSs (OR = 1.86) compared with those in the lowest decile. Of the three genetic risk groups, the low genetic risk group contained more HCs, whereas the genetic BD and SCZ groups contained more SCZ patients (p < 0.05). SCZ patients had widespread cognitive impairments, and FRs had cognitive impairments that were between those of SCZ patients and HCs (p < 0.05). Cognitive differences between HCs in the low genetic risk group and SCZ patients in the genetic BD or genetic SCZ groups were more prominent (Cohen's d > -0.20) than those between HCs and SCZ patients in the no genetic risk group. Furthermore, SCZ patients in the genetic SCZ group displayed lower scores in verbal fluency and attention than those in the genetic BD group (d > -0.20). Conclusions Our findings suggest that cognitive impairments in SCZ are partially mediated through genetic loadings for SCZ but not BD.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Prospective studies on PEs are scarce, and to date no study investigated PE prevalence, incidence, persistence, their risk indicators, and psychiatric comorbidity, in one dataset. Furthermore, most studies are based on self-report, and it is unclear how this compares to clinical interviews. Methods Data are used from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2), a psychiatric cohort study among a representative sample of adults (baseline characteristics: N = 6646; 49.6% female; 18-64 years). Results are presented for self-reported and clinically validated PEs. Associations are assessed for mental disorders, socio-demographic, vulnerability, physical health, and substance use factors. Results Based on self-report, at baseline 16.5% of respondents had at least one PE in their lifetime, of those, 30.1% also reported a PE at 3-year follow-up. 4.8% had a first PE at 3-year follow up. The 3-year prevalence of PE was associated with almost all studied risk indicators. Generally, the strongest associations were found for mental health disorders. Prevalence and incidence rates were two to three times higher in self-report than in clinical interview but results on associated factors were similar. Conclusions Validated prevalence and incidence estimates of PE are substantially lower than self-reported figures but results on associated factors were similar. Therefore, future studies on associations of PEs can rely on relatively inexpensive self-reports of PEs.

Study objectives were (i) test the intervention's feasibility, (ii) provide effect size estimates, (iii) assess dose-response and (iv) select primary outcomes for future trials. Methods In a double-blind randomised controlled trial, sixty-three outpatients with clinically significant paranoia were randomised to either CBM-pa or an active control (text reading) between April 2016 and September 2017. Patients received one 40 min session per week for 6 weeks. Assessments were given at baseline, after each interim session, post-treatment, and at 1- and 3-months post-treatment. Results A total of 122 patients were screened and 63 were randomised. The recruitment rate was 51.2%, with few dropouts (four out of 63) and follow-up rates were 90.5% (1-month) and 93.7% (3-months). Each session took 30-40 min to complete. There was no statistical evidence of harmful effects of the intervention. Preliminary data were consistent with efficacy of CBM-pa over text-reading control: patients randomised to the intervention, compared to control patients, reported reduced interpretation bias (d = -0.48 to -0.76), improved symptoms of paranoia (d = -0.19 to -0.38), and lower depressed and anxious mood (d = -0.03 to -0.29). The intervention effect was evident after the third session. Conclusions CBM-pa is feasible for patients with paranoia. A fully powered randomised control trial is warranted.

This study evaluated the role of personality pathology in the treatment of depression by testing whether maladaptive personality traits (1) predict changes in depression over treatment or vice versa, (2) change themselves over treatment, (3) change differentially depending on treatment with schema therapy (ST) or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), and (4) moderate the effectiveness of these treatments. Methods We included 193 depressed inpatients (53.4% women, Mage = 42.9, SD = 13.4) participating in an assessor-blind randomized clinical trial and receiving a 7-week course of ST or CBT. The research questions were addressed using multiple indicator latent change score models as well as multigroup structural equation models implemented in EffectLiteR. Results Maladaptive traits did not predict changes in depressive symptoms at post-treatment, or vice versa. However, maladaptive trait domains decreased over treatment (standardized Δ range: -0.38 to -0.89), irrespective of treatment with ST or CBT. Maladaptive traits at baseline did not moderate the effectiveness of these treatments. Conclusions Self-reported maladaptive personality traits can change during treatment of depression, but may have limited prognostic or prescriptive value, at least in the context of ST or CBT. These results need to be replicated using follow-up data, larger and more diverse samples, and informant-rated measures of personality pathology.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Neural systems involved in reward and loss processing are thought to contribute to AB. However, investigations into these processes are limited: few have considered anticipatory and consummatory components of reward, response to loss, nor whether associations with AB may vary by level of callous-unemotional (CU) traits. Methods A population-based community sample of 128 predominantly low-income youth (mean age = 15.9 years; 42% male) completed a monetary incentive delay task during fMRI. A multi-informant, multi-method latent variable approach was used to test associations between AB and neural response to reward and loss anticipation and outcome and whether CU traits moderated these associations. Results AB was not associated with neural response to reward but was associated with reduced frontoparietal activity during loss outcomes. This association was moderated by CU traits such that individuals with higher levels of AB and CU traits had the largest reductions in frontoparietal activity. Co-occurring AB and CU traits were also associated with increased precuneus response during loss anticipation. Conclusions Findings indicate that AB is associated with reduced activity in brain regions involved in cognitive control, attention, and behavior modification during negative outcomes. Moreover, these reductions are most pronounced in youth with co-occurring CU traits. These findings have implications for understanding why adolescents involved in AB continue these behaviors despite severe negative consequences (e.g. incarceration).  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This study sought to evaluate and develop a panel of multiple serum biomarkers for predicting SBs in outpatients receiving a 12-month pharmacotherapy programme for depressive disorders. Methods At baseline, 14 serum biomarkers and socio-demographic/clinical characteristics including previous suicidal attempt and present suicidal severity were evaluated in 1094 patients with depressive disorders without a bipolar diagnosis. Of these, 884 were followed for increased suicidal severity and fatal/non-fatal suicide attempt outcomes over a 12-month treatment period. Individual and combined effects of serum biomarkers on these two prospective SBs were estimated using logistic regression analysis after adjustment for relevant covariates. Results Increased suicidal severity and fatal/non-fatal suicide attempt during the 12-month pharmacotherapy were present in 155 (17.5%) and 38 (4.3%) participants, respectively. Combined cortisol, total cholesterol, and folate serum biomarkers predicted fatal/non-fatal suicide attempt, and these with interleukin-1 beta and homocysteine additionally predicted increased suicidal severity, with clear gradients robust to adjustment (p values < 0.001). Conclusions Application of multiple serum biomarkers could considerably improve the predictability of SBs during the outpatient treatment of depressive disorders, potentially highlighting the need for more frequent monitoring and risk appraisal.

This study is the first to explore mental health trajectories and associated predictors in military members across the first 3-4 years of their career to provide evidence to inform early interventions. Methods This prospective cohort study surveyed Australian Defence personnel (n = 5329) at four time-points across their early military career. Core outcomes were psychological distress (K10+) and posttraumatic stress symptoms [four-item PTSD Checklist (PCL-4)] with intra-individual, organizational and event-related trajectory predictors. Latent class growth analyses (LCGAs) identified subgroups within the sample that followed similar longitudinal trajectories for these outcomes, while conditional LCGAs examined the variables that influenced patterns of mental health. Results Three clear trajectories emerged for psychological distress: resilient (84.0%), worsening (9.6%) and recovery (6.5%). Four trajectories emerged for post-traumatic stress, including resilient (82.5%), recovery (9.6%), worsening (5.8%) and chronic subthreshold (2.3%) trajectories. Across both outcomes, prior trauma exposure alongside modifiable factors, such as maladaptive coping styles, and increased anger and sleep difficulties were associated with the worsening and chronic subthreshold trajectories, whilst members in the resilient trajectories were more likely to be male, report increased social support from family/friends and Australian Defence Force (ADF) sources, and use adaptive coping styles. Conclusions The emergence of symptoms of mental health problems occurs early in the military lifecycle for a significant proportion of individuals. Modifiable factors associated with wellbeing identified in this study are ideal targets for intervention, and should be embedded and consolidated throughout the military career.

In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that BWV is associated with the risk of new-onset depression. Methods Data from a nationwide population-based cohort in the Korean National Health Insurance Service database were analyzed for 6 598 570 adults with no history of depression and reports of at least three health examinations. BWV was estimated using variability independent of the mean indices and divided into quartiles (Q1 lowest, Q4 highest BWV). Cox proportional hazard models were applied to assess the risk of depression according to the quartile of BWV. Results The incident rate for depression from Q1 to Q4 of BWV was 20.7, 20.3, 20.8, and 22.2 per 1000 person-years, respectively. BWV, especially high BWV, was associated with an increased risk of depression after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, income, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The hazard ratio (HR) of new-onset depression was highest in Q4 relative to Q1 in the total population (HR 1.12, p < 0.0001) and was higher in women than in men (HR 1.72 v. 1.16, p < 0.0001). In stratified analyses, regardless of obesity or weight change status at baseline, the risk of depression was increased when bodyweight fluctuated highly during follow-up. Conclusions High BWV was associated with an increased risk of depression. Further studies need to evaluate the role of high BWV with respect to the onset of depression.

Existing research has primarily focused on adults and then, typically on a single disorder. Examining brain characteristics in late childhood, when the brain is preparing to undergo significant adolescent reorganization and various forms of serious psychopathology are just first emerging, may allow for a unique and highly important perspective of overlapping and unique pathogenesis. Methods A total of 8645 youth were recruited as part of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected, and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), depressive, and anxiety symptoms were assessed three times over a 2-year period. Cortical thickness, surface area, and subcortical volume were used to predict baseline symptomatology and symptom progression over time. Results Some features could possibly signal common vulnerability, predicting progression across forms of psychopathology (e.g. superior frontal and middle temporal regions). However, there was a specific predictive value for emerging PLEs (lateral occipital and precentral thickness), anxiety (parietal thickness/area and cingulate), and depression (e.g. parahippocampal and inferior temporal). Conclusion Findings indicate common and distinct patterns of vulnerability for varying forms of psychopathology are present during late childhood, before the adolescent reorganization, and have direct relevance for informing novel conceptual models along with early prevention and intervention efforts.

We explored the familial association between parental SMI and body mass index (BMI) in middle-aged offspring. Our objective was to determine if the offspring of either parent with SMI have an increased risk for obesity. Methods The Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 is a cohort study of offspring with expected date of birth in 1966. The data include originally 12 068 mothers and 12 231 children from the provinces of Lapland and Oulu in Finland. The final study sample included 5050 middle-aged offspring. Parental SMI was used as exposure in the study. BMI measured at the age of 46 years was used as a primary outcome. Results Risk for obesity was elevated in the offspring of mothers with SMI [overweight: adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.93 (1.29-2.90), obese class I: 1.97 (1.20-3.25), obese classes II-III: 2.98 (1.67-5.33)]. For the offspring of either parent with SMI, statistically significant results were found in obese class I and obese classes II-III [overweight: adjusted OR 1.21 (0.94-1.54), obese class I: 1.52 (1.03-1.08), obese classes II-III: 1.53 (1.01-2.32)]. Conclusions We found an elevated risk of obesity in the middle-aged offspring of either parent with SMI, especially in the offspring of mothers with SMI.

The current analyses used posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom data collected over a 5-year period to estimate a more robust between-subject network and an associated symptom change network. Methods A PTSD symptom network is measured in a sample of military veterans across four time points (Ns = 1254, 1231, 1106, 925). The repeated measures permit isolating between-subject associations by limiting the effects of within-subject variability. The result is a highly reliable PTSD symptom network. A symptom slope network depicting covariation of symptom change over time is also estimated. Results Negative trauma-related emotions had particularly strong associations with the network. Trauma-related amnesia, sleep disturbance, and self-destructive behavior had weaker overall associations with other PTSD symptoms. Conclusions PTSD's network structure appears stable over time. There is no single 'most important' node or node cluster.

Studies of adult populations suggest functional abnormalities in reward and inhibitory control networks. Despite behavioral markers often developing in children, the neurobiology of pediatric BED remains unstudied. Methods 58 pre-adolescent children (aged 9-10-years) with BED (mBMI = 25.05; s.d. = 5.40) and 66 age, BMI and developmentally matched control children (mBMI = 25.78; s.d. = 0.33) were extracted from the 3.0 baseline (Year 0) release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. We investigated group differences in resting-state functional MRI functional connectivity (FC) within and between reward and inhibitory control networks. A seed-based approach was employed to assess nodes in the reward [orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), nucleus accumbens, amygdala] and inhibitory control [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)] networks via hypothesis-driven seed-to-seed analyses, and secondary seed-to-voxel analyses. Results Findings revealed reduced FC between the dlPFC and amygdala, and between the ACC and OFC in pre-adolescent children with BED, relative to controls. These findings indicating aberrant connectivity between nodes of inhibitory control and reward networks were corroborated by the whole-brain FC analyses. Conclusions Early-onset BED may be characterized by diffuse abnormalities in the functional synergy between reward and cognitive control networks, without perturbations within reward and inhibitory control networks, respectively. The decreased capacity to regulate a reward-driven pursuit of hedonic foods, which is characteristic of BED, may in part, rest on this dysconnectivity between reward and inhibitory control networks.

Prior task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) findings suggest these MDD phenotypes are associated with altered reward and interoceptive processing. Methods Using resting-state fMRI data, we compared the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF) and seed-based connectivity (SBC) among hyperphagic (n = 77), hypophagic (n = 66), and euphagic (n = 42) MDD groups and a healthy comparison group (n = 38). We examined fALFF and SBC in a mask restricted to reward [nucleus accumbens (NAcc), putamen, caudate, ventral pallidum, and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)] and interoceptive (anterior insula and hypothalamus) regions and also performed exploratory whole-brain analyses. SBC analyses included as seeds the NAcc and also regions demonstrating group differences in fALFF (i.e. right lateral OFC and right anterior insula). All analyses used threshold-free cluster enhancement. Results Mask-restricted analyses revealed stronger fALFF in the right lateral OFC, and weaker fALFF in the right anterior insula, for hyperphagic MDD v. healthy comparison. We also found weaker SBC between the right lateral OFC and left anterior insula for hyperphagic MDD v. healthy comparison. Whole-brain analyses revealed weaker fALFF in the right anterior insula, and stronger SBC between the right lateral OFC and left precentral gyrus, for hyperphagic MDD v. healthy comparison. Findings were no longer significant after controlling for body mass index, which was higher for hyperphagic MDD.

High mortality rates have been reported in some risk groups, including patients with pre-existing mental disorders. Methods We used electronic health records to retrospectively identify people infected due to COVID-19 (between March 2020 and March 2021) in the three territories of the Basque Country. COVID-19 cases were defined as individuals who had tested positive on a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models and multilevel analyses with generalized estimated equations were used to determine factors associated with COVID-19-related mortality and hospital admission. Results The COVID-19 mortality rate was increased for patients with psychotic disorders [odds ratio (OR) adjusted: 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.09-1.94), p = 0.0114] and patients with substance abuse [OR adjusted: 1.88, 95% CI (1.13-3.14, p < 0.0152)]. The mortality rate was lower for patients with affective disorders [OR adjusted: 0.80, 95% CI (0.61-0.99), p = 0.0407]. Hospital admission rates due to COVID-19 were higher in psychosis [OR adjusted: 2.90, 95% CI (2.36-3.56), p < 0.0001] and anxiety disorder groups [OR adjusted: 1.54, 95% CI (1.37-1.72), p < 0.0001]. Among admitted patients, COVID-19 mortality rate was decreased for those with affective disorders rate [OR adjusted: 0.72, 95% CI (0.55-0.95), p = 0.0194]. Conclusions COVID-19-related mortality and hospitalizations rates were higher for patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Here, we investigate the joint factor structure of psychopathology and personality in eight-year-old children, estimate factor heritability and explore external validity through associations with established developmental risk factors. Methods Phenotypic and biometric exploratory factor analyses with bifactor rotation on genetically informative data from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort (MoBa) study. The analytic sub-sample comprised 10 739 children (49% girls). Mothers reported their children's symptoms of depression (Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire), anxiety (Screen for Anxiety Related Disorders), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder inattention and hyperactivity, oppositional-defiant disorder, conduct disorder (Parent/Teacher Rating Scale for Disruptive Behavior Disorders), and Big Five personality (short Hierarchical Personality Inventory for Children). Developmental risk factors (early gestational age and being small for gestational age) were collected from the Medical Birth Registry. Results Goodness-of-fit indices favored a p factor model with three residual latent factors interpreted as negative affectivity, positive affectivity, and antagonism, whereas psychometric indices favored a one-factor model. ADE solutions fitted best, and regression analyses indicated a negative association between gestational age and the p factor, for both the one- and four-factor solutions. Conclusion Correlations between normative and pathological traits in middle childhood mostly reflect one heritable and psychometrically interpretable p factor, although optimal fit to data required less interpretable residual latent factors. The association between the p factor and low gestational age warrants further study of early developmental mechanisms.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Novel and highly scalable interventions such as internet-based cognitive-behavioral-therapy (iCBT) may help to address this treatment gap. Anhedonia, a hallmark symptom of MDD that refers to diminished interest and ability to experience pleasure, has been associated with reduced reactivity in a neural reward circuit that includes medial prefrontal and striatal brain regions. Whether iCBT can reduce anhedonia severity in MDD patients, and whether these therapeutic effects are accompanied by enhanced reward circuit reactivity has yet to be examined. Methods Fifty-two MDD patients were randomly assigned to either 10-week iCBT (n = 26) or monitored attention control (MAC, n = 26) programs. All patients completed pre- and post-treatment assessments of anhedonia (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale; SHAPS) and reward circuit reactivity [monetary incentive delay (MID) task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)]. Healthy control participants (n = 42) also underwent two fMRI scans while completing the MID task 10 weeks apart. Results Both iCBT and MAC groups exhibited a reduction in anhedonia severity post-treatment. Nevertheless, only the iCBT group exhibited enhanced nucleus accumbens (Nacc) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) activation and functional connectivity from pre- to post-treatment in response to reward feedback. Enhanced Nacc and sgACC activations were associated with reduced anhedonia severity following iCBT treatment, with enhanced Nacc activation also mediating the reduction in anhedonia severity post-treatment. Conclusions These findings suggest that increased reward circuit reactivity may contribute to a reduction in anhedonia severity following iCBT treatment for depression.

Methods We examined, in 1 137 354 native Swedes with one of 59 3-digit official and objective occupational codes in managerial and educated classes, their familial genetic risk score (FGRS) for ten major disorders, calculated from 1st through 5th degree relatives. Mean FGRS across disorders were calculated, in 3- and 4-digit occupational groups, and then controlled for those whose disorder onset preceded occupational choice. Using sequential analyses, p values were evaluated using Bonferroni correction. Results 3-digit professions considered to reflect creativity (e.g. 'artists' and 'authors') were among those with statistically significant elevations of FGRS. Among more specific 4-digit codes, visual artists, actors, and authors stood out with elevated genetic risks, highest for major depression (MD), anxiety disorders (AD) and OCD, more modest for bipolar disorders (BD) and schizophrenia and, for authors, for drug and alcohol use disorders. However, equal or greater elevations in FGRS across disorders were seen for religious (e.g. ministers), helping (e.g. psychologists, social workers), and teaching/academic occupations (e.g. professors). The potential pathway from FGRS → Disorder → Occupation accounts for a modest proportion of the signal, largely for MD and AD risk. Conclusions While traditional creative occupations were associated with elevated genetic risk for a range of psychiatric disorders, this association was not unique, as similar, or greater elevations were seen for religious, helping and teaching professions and was stronger for internalizing than psychotic disorders.

This study examined the variation in its psychological impact across the first four waves of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Methods Transcripts from Open Up, an online text-based counseling service, between January 2019 and January 2021 were analyzed (N = 60 775). We identified COVID-19 mentioned sessions using keywords and further categorized them into those that also mentioned symptoms of common mental disorders (CMDs) and those that did not. Autoregressive integrated moving average models were used to analyze the associations between the severity of the outbreak and the mention of COVID-19 and CMDs. Results Results revealed that the pandemic led to increased psychological distress. Compared to prior to its advent, more people sought help in the initial months of the outbreak. Furthermore, associations were found between the severity of the outbreak and the number of help-seeker mentioning the pandemic, as well as between the outbreak severity and the number of help-seekers disclosing psychological distress. However, these relationships were not uniform across the four waves of outbreaks; a dissociation between outbreak severity and help-seekers' concern was found in the fourth wave. Conclusion As the pandemic waxes and wanes, people may become habituated to its psychological toll. This may be interpreted as a form of resilience. Instead of worsening with time, the psychological impact of COVID-19 may reduce with repeated exposure.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Biological cardiac risk factors are already elevated in depressed patients without existing CVD. The purpose of this exploratory trial was to examine whether treating Major Depression (MD) with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is associated with improvements in cardiac risk biomarkers and whether depressive symptom severity at baseline moderates treatment effects. Methods Eighty antidepressant-free patients with MD were randomly assigned to CBT or waiting list (WL). Biological outcomes included long-term recordings (24-h, daytime, nighttime) of heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and blood pressure, as well as inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. A sample of 40 age- and sex-matched non-clinical controls was also involved to verify biological alterations in MD at study entry. Results Compared to WL, CBT was associated with a significant increase in overall HRV, as indexed by the 24-h and daytime HRV triangular index, as well as trend improvements in 24-h low-frequency HRV and daytime systolic blood pressure. Self-rated depressive symptom severity moderated (or tended to moderate) improvements in CBT for 24-h and daytime heart rate and several indices of HRV (especially daytime measures). Inflammatory treatment effects were not observed. Conclusions CBT increased overall HRV in patients with MD. Initially more depressed patients showed the most pronounced cardiovascular improvements through CBT. These exploratory findings may provide new insights into the biological effects of psychological treatment against depression and must be confirmed through future research.

This study aims to investigate the association between neighbourhood-level social capital and clinical transitions within the spectrum of psychosis. Methods In total, 2175 participants, representative of a community-based population, were assessed twice (6 years apart) to determine their position within an extended psychosis spectrum: no symptoms, subclinical psychotic experiences (PE), clinical PE, PD. A variable representing change between baseline (T1) and follow-up (T2) assessment was constructed. Four dimensions of social capital (informal social control, social disorganisation, social cohesion and trust, cognitive social capital) were assessed at baseline in an independent sample, and the measures were aggregated to the neighbourhood level. Associations between the variable representing psychosis spectrum change from T1 to T2 and the social capital variables were investigated. Results Lower levels of neighbourhood-level social disorganisation, meaning higher levels of social capital, reduced the risk of clinical PE onset (OR 0.300; z = -2.75; p = 0.006), persistence of clinical PE (OR 0.314; z = -2.36; p = 0.018) and also the transition to PD (OR 0.136; z = -2.12; p = 0.034). The other social capital variables were not associated with changes from T1 to T2. Conclusions Neighbourhood-level social disorganisation may be associated with the risk of psychosis expression. Whilst replication of this finding is required, it may point to level of social disorganisation as a public health target moderating population psychosis risk.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Neuroimaging studies on self-evaluations in SA have mainly focused on subcortical threat processing systems. Yet, self-evaluation may concurrently invoke diverse affective processing, as motivational systems related to desired self-views may also be activated. To investigate the conflictual nature that may accompany self-evaluation of certain social domains in SA, we examined brain activity related to both threat and reward processing. Methods Participants (N = 74) differing in self-reported SA-severity underwent fMRI while completing a self-evaluation task, wherein they judged the self-descriptiveness of high- v. low-intensity traits in the domains of power and affiliation (i.e. social connectedness). Participants also completed two auxiliary fMRI tasks designated to evoke reward- and threat-related activations in the ventral striatum (VS) and amygdala, respectively. We hypothesized that self-evaluations in SA, particularly in the domain of power, involve aberrant brain activity related to both threat and reward processing. Results SA-severity was more negatively associated with power than with affiliation self-evaluations. During self-evaluative judgment of high-power (e.g. dominant), SA-severity associated with increased activity in the VS and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Moreover, SA-severity correlated with higher similarity between brain activity patterns activated by high-power traits and patterns activated by incentive salience (i.e. reward anticipation) in the VS during the reward task. Conclusions Our findings indicate that self-evaluation of high-power in SA involves excessive striatal reward-related activation, and pinpoint the downregulation of VS-VMPFC activity within such self-evaluative context as a potential neural outcome for therapeutic interventions.

Given the evidence that sleep disturbance and alterations in interferon (IFN)-γ biology are associated with depression risk, this study examines the separate and joint contributions of poor sleep maintenance and IFN-γ to depressed mood in older adults. Methods Community-dwelling, non-depressed older adults (n = 36, 72.1 ± 6.8 years) underwent a night of polysomnography to assess sleep maintenance [i.e. wake time after sleep onset (WASO)]. The morning after polysomnography, plasma levels of IFN-γ were evaluated along with self-reported depressed mood throughout the day. Multivariate linear regression tested associations of WASO and IFN-γ with the severity of depressed mood. In addition, moderation and mediation models examined the role of IFN-γ for the relationship between WASO and depressed mood. Results A greater amount of WASO (p < 0.05) and higher levels of IFN-γ (p < 0.01) were both associated with the severity of depressed mood. Moreover, IFN-γ moderated the relationship between WASO and depressed mood (p < 0.01), such that WASO was more strongly related to the depressed mood among those with higher IFN-γ, than among those with lower IFN-γ. However, IFN-γ did not mediate the relationship between WASO and depressed mood. Conclusion In this study of older adults, poor sleep maintenance and higher levels of IFN-γ were both related to depressed mood. Moreover, IFN-γ moderated the relationship between poor sleep maintenance and depressed mood. Together, these findings suggest that older adults with higher IFN-γ are at heightened risk for depressive symptoms following sleep disturbance.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Method An analysis was performed of the 2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions III (NESARC-III), a US nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized civilian adults, focusing on respondents who were aged © 21 (n = 34 712). Structural equation modeling was used to identify the psychopathological dimensions underlying psychiatric disorders; to examine associations between risk factors, psychopathological dimensions and individual disorders; and to test whether associations of risk factors occurring earlier in life were mediated by risk factors occurring later in life. Results A bifactor model of 13 axis I disorders provided a good fit (CFI = 0.987, TLI = 0.982, and RMSEA = 0.011) including an overall psychopathology factor as measured by all 13 disorders and 2 specific factors, one for externalizing disorders and one for fear-related disorders. A substantial proportion of the total effects of the risk factors occurring early in life were indirectly mediated through factors occurring later in life. All risk factors showed a significant total effect on the general psychopathology, externalizing and fear-related factors. Only 23 of 325 direct associations of risk factors with psychiatric disorders achieved statistical significance. Conclusion Most risk factors for psychiatric disorders are mediated through broad psychopathological dimensions. The central role of these dimensions supports trans-diagnostic etiological and intervention research.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

However, reliable estimates of the prevalence and its contribution to developing major depression under different terminologies depicting subthreshold depression have to be established. Methods By searching PubMed and Web of Science using predefined inclusion criteria, we included 1 129 969 individuals from 113 studies conducted. The prevalence estimates were calculated using the random effect model. The incidence risk ratio (IRR) was estimated by measuring the ratio of individuals with subthreshold depression who developed major depression compared to that of non-depressed individuals from 19 studies (88, 882 individuals). Results No significant difference in the prevalence among the different terminologies depicting subthreshold depression (Q = 1.96, p = 0.5801) was found. By pooling the prevalence estimates of subthreshold depression in 113 studies, we obtained a summary prevalence of 11.02% [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.78-12.33%]. The youth group had the highest prevalence (14.17%, 95% CI 8.82-20.55%), followed by the elderly group (12.95%, 95% CI 11.41-14.58%) and the adult group (8.92%, 95% CI 7.51-10.45%). Further analysis of 19 studies' incidence rates showed individuals with subthreshold depression had an increased risk of developing major depression (IRR = 2.95, 95% CI 2.33-3.73), and the term minor depression showed the highest IRR compared with other terms (IRR = 3.97, 95% CI 3.17-4.96). Conclusions Depression could be a spectrum disorder, with subthreshold depression being a significant precursor to and a risk factor for major depression. Proactive management of subthreshold depression could be effective for managing the increasing prevalence of major depression.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

We examined whether the relative risk of psychosis among migrants is low on arrival and increases thereafter. Methods In this cohort study, first-generation immigrants to the Netherlands, aged 10 years and older (N = 1 281 678), were matched by birth year and sex to 2 542 313 native-born Dutch controls. The first occurrence of psychosis after arrival was established using data on dispensing of antipsychotic medication (APM) (during 2006-2017) and on insurance claims for treatment of psychosis (2011-2016). The Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) for migrants compared to controls were estimated by year since arrival. Results The IRR of APM was 0.22 (95% CI 0.21-0.24) in the year of arrival ('year 1') and increased gradually to 1.39 (1.19-1.62) after 10 or more years. The IRR of an insurance claim increased from 0.57 (0.51-0.62) to 1.87 (1.38-2.55) in year 5. Among migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, the IRR of an insurance claim was already high in year 1 [2.46 (1.95-3.11)], especially when aged 10-20 years at arrival [6.09 (2.93-12.64)]. Among migrants from other non-Western countries, the IRR was already significantly increased in year 2 [1.28 (1.03-1.59)]. Conclusions The relative risk of psychosis among migrants was generally low at arrival and increased thereafter. The increased IRRs in the early years after arrival among those from non-Western countries indicate that for these groups certain risk factors are already relevant shortly after arrival.

Pre-emptively informing patients of their likelihood of responding could be useful as part of a patient-centered treatment decision-support plan. Methods This prospective observational study examined a national sample of 807 patients beginning psychotherapy for MDD at the Veterans Health Administration. Patients completed a self-report survey at baseline and 3-months follow-up (data collected 2018-2020). We developed a machine learning (ML) model to predict psychotherapy response at 3 months using baseline survey, administrative, and geospatial variables in a 70% training sample. Model performance was then evaluated in the 30% test sample. Results 32.0% of patients responded to treatment after 3 months. The best ML model had an AUC (SE) of 0.652 (0.038) in the test sample. Among the one-third of patients ranked by the model as most likely to respond, 50.0% in the test sample responded to psychotherapy. In comparison, among the remaining two-thirds of patients, <25% responded to psychotherapy. The model selected 43 predictors, of which nearly all were self-report variables. Conclusions Patients with MDD could pre-emptively be informed of their likelihood of responding to psychotherapy using a prediction tool based on self-report data. This tool could meaningfully help patients and providers in shared decision-making, although parallel information about the likelihood of responding to alternative treatments would be needed to inform decision-making across multiple treatments.

Here, we investigate whether the antipsychotic mechanisms of CBD are underpinned by their effects on insular activation, known to be involved in salience processing. Methods A within-subject, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of 19 healthy controls and 15 participants with early psychosis was conducted. Administration of a single dose of CBD was compared with placebo in psychosis participants while performing the monetary incentive delay task, an fMRI paradigm. Anticipation of reward and loss were used to contrast motivationally salient stimuli against a neutral control condition. Results No group differences in brain activation between psychosis patients compared with healthy controls were observed. Attenuation of insula activation was observed following CBD, compared to placebo. Sensitivity analyses controlling for current cannabis use history did not affect the main results. Conclusion Our findings are in accordance with existing evidence suggesting that CBD modulates brain regions involved in salience processing. Whether such effects underlie the putative antipsychotic effects of CBD remains to be investigated.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

However, most research has focused on the sum scores of symptoms. Relatively little is known about how individual symptoms respond. Methods Longitudinal models were used to explore how depression and generalised anxiety symptoms behave over the course of CBT in a retrospective, observational cohort of patients from primary care settings (n = 5306). Logistic mixed models were used to examine the probability of being symptom-free across CBT appointments, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale as measures. Results All symptoms improve across CBT treatment. The results suggest that low mood/hopelessness and guilt/worthlessness improved quickest relative to other depressive symptoms, with sleeping problems, appetite changes, and psychomotor retardation/agitation improving relatively slower. Uncontrollable worry and too much worry were the anxiety symptoms that improved fastest; irritability and restlessness improved the slowest. Conclusions This research suggests there is a benefit to examining symptoms rather than sum scores alone. Investigations of symptoms provide the potential for precision psychiatry and may explain some of the heterogeneity observed in clinical outcomes when only sum scores are considered.

A more elaborate study of the intrinsic and extrinsic correlates of suicidal ideation and behaviours particularly amid ongoing population-level stressors and the identification of less stigmatising markers in representative youth populations is essential. Methods Participants (n = 2540, aged 15-25) were consecutively recruited from an ongoing large-scale household-based epidemiological youth mental health study in Hong Kong between September 2019 and 2021. Lifetime and 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt were assessed, alongside suicide-related rumination, hopelessness and neuroticism, personal and population-level stressors, family functioning, cognitive ability, lifetime non-suicidal self-harm, 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD), and alcohol use. Results The 12-month prevalence of suicidal ideation, ideation-only (no plan or attempt), plan, and attempt was 20.0, 15.4, 4.6, and 1.3%, respectively. Importantly, multivariable logistic regression findings revealed that suicide-related rumination was the only factor associated with all four suicidal outcomes (all p < 0.01). Among those with suicidal ideation (two-stage approach), intrinsic factors, including suicide-related rumination, poorer cognitive ability, and 12-month MDE, were specifically associated with suicide plan, while extrinsic factors, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stressors, poorer family functioning, and personal life stressors, as well as non-suicidal self-harm, were specifically associated with suicide attempt. Conclusions Suicide-related rumination, population-level COVID-19 stressors, and poorer family functioning may be important less-stigmatising markers for youth suicidal risks. The respective roles played by not only intrinsic but also extrinsic factors in suicide plan and attempt using a two-stage approach should be considered in future preventative intervention work.

However, as adults with sD are less likely to seek face-to-face intervention, internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (ICBT) may overcome barriers of accessibility to psychotherapy. Although several trials explored the efficacy of ICBT for sD, the results remain inconsistent. This study evaluated whether ICBT is effective in reducing depressive symptoms among Chinese adults with sD. Methods A randomized controlled trial was performed. The participants were randomly assigned to 5 weeks of ICBT, group-based face-to-face cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or a waiting list (WL). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention and at a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measured depressive symptoms using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Outcomes were analyzed using a mixed-effects model to assess the effects of ICBT. Results ICBT participants reported greater reductions on all the outcomes compared to the WL group at post-intervention. The ICBT group showed larger improvement on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at post-intervention (d = 0.12) and at follow-up (d = 0.10), and with CES-D at post-intervention (d = 0.06), compared to the CBT group. Conclusions ICBT is effective in reducing depressive symptoms among Chinese adults with sD, and improvements in outcomes were sustained at a 6-month follow-up. Considering the low rates of face-to-face psychotherapy, our findings highlight the considerable potential and implications for the Chinese government to promote the use of ICBT for sD in China.

Method Eighty adults aged 55-85 years with mood disorders completed assessments of religion (affiliation, service attendance, importance of religion, belief and faith in God), depression, and suicidality over time (M = 7.31 measurements over M = 727 days). We computed metrics to identify mean and maximum levels of depression and suicidality, and the number of episodes of significant depression and suicidality experienced by each participant. Results Religious affiliation and importance of religion, but not service attendance, belief, or faith in God, were associated with lower mean and maximum depression. Conversely, all facets of religion predicted significantly lower mean and maximum levels of suicidality (rs ranging from -0.24 to -0.39), and substantially less likelihood of experiencing significant suicidality during the study (ORs ranging from 0.19 to 0.33). Service attendance, belief, and faith in God predicted less suicidality even among individuals who did not affiliate with a religious group. Conclusions Religious factors, particularly faith in God, are associated with substantially less suicidality over time among older adults with mood disorders, irrespective of religious affiliation.

However, contemporary, population-based data on the prevalence, correlates, and mental health burden of homelessness among veterans are lacking. Methods Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative survey of veterans (n = 4069). Analyses examined the prevalence and correlates of homelessness, as well as the independent associations between homelessness and current probable psychiatric conditions, suicidality, and functioning. Results The lifetime prevalence of homelessness was 10.2% (95% confidence interval 9.3-11.2). More than 8-of-10 veterans reported experiencing their first episode of homelessness following military service, with a mean of 10.6 years post-discharge until onset (s.d. = 12.6). Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), cumulative trauma burden, current household income, younger age, and drug use disorder emerged as the strongest correlates of homelessness (49% of total explained variance). Veterans with a history of homelessness had elevated odds of lifetime suicide attempt, attempting suicide two or more times, and past-year suicide ideation [odd ratios (ORs) 1.3-3.1]. They also had higher rates of current probable posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive, generalized anxiety, and drug use disorders (ORs 1.7-2.4); and scored lower on measures of mental, physical, cognitive, psychosocial functioning (d = 0.11-0.15). Conclusions One in ten U.S. veterans has experienced homelessness, and these veterans represent a subpopulation at substantially heightened risk for poor mental health and suicide. ACEs were the strongest factor associated with homelessness, thus underscoring the importance of targeting early childhood adversities and their mental health consequences in prevention efforts for homelessness in this population.

However, longitudinal studies with racially and socioeconomically diverse samples of young mothers are lacking, and little is known about developmental patterns of depression across the lifespan that can inform preventive interventions. Methods Young primiparous mothers (n = 399, 13-25 years, 81% Black) were recruited from a population-based prospective study that began in childhood. Women reported on depression symptoms for at least 3 years prior to their pregnancy, during pregnancy, and at 4 months postpartum. Linear regression models were used to estimate change in pre-pregnancy depression severity and to evaluate associations between patterns of lifetime history and postpartum depression symptoms. Results Results revealed high levels of continuity in depression from pregnancy to postpartum, and across multiple years pre-pregnancy to postpartum. Overall, depression severity leading up to pregnancy decreased over time, but patterns of worsening or improving symptoms were not associated with depression severity in the postpartum period. Instead, area under the pre-pregnancy trajectory curve, representing cumulative lifetime depression burden, was uniquely associated with postpartum depression after adjusting for prenatal depression severity. Conclusions Depression in the postpartum period should be considered within a lifespan perspective of risk that accumulates before conception. Clinical screening and early interventions are needed in adolescence and young adulthood to prevent the onset and persistence of depressive symptoms that could have long-term implications for peripartum health.

However, prior research has not focused on or identified definitive predictors of SRI treatment outcomes. Leveraging precision medicine techniques such as machine learning can facilitate the prediction of treatment outcomes. Methods The study used 10-fold cross-validation support vector machine (SVM) learning models to predict three treatment outcomes (i.e. response, partial remission, and full remission) for 97 patients with BDD receiving up to 14-weeks of open-label treatment with the SRI escitalopram. SVM models used baseline clinical and demographic variables as predictors. Feature importance analyses complemented traditional SVM modeling to identify which variables most successfully predicted treatment response. Results SVM models indicated acceptable classification performance for predicting treatment response with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77 (sensitivity = 0.77 and specificity = 0.63), partial remission with an AUC of 0.75 (sensitivity = 0.67 and specificity = 0.73), and full remission with an AUC of 0.79 (sensitivity = 0.70 and specificity = 0.79). Feature importance analyses supported constructs such as better quality of life and less severe depression, general psychopathology symptoms, and hopelessness as more predictive of better treatment outcome; demographic variables were least predictive. Conclusions The current study is the first to demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can successfully predict treatment outcomes for pharmacotherapy for BDD. Consistent with precision medicine initiatives in psychiatry, the current study provides a foundation for personalized pharmacotherapy strategies for patients with BDD.

However, most investigations on this topic have been cross-sectional, precluding causal inferences. Thus, we used cross-lagged prospective network analyses to facilitate causal inferences in understanding the relations between psychopathology and cognitive functioning components. Methods Racially-diverse midlife women (n = 1816) participated in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation at two time-points, spanning one year apart. Five psychopathology (anxiety severity, depressed mood, somatic symptoms, positive affect, interpersonal problems) and four cognitive functioning nodes (working memory (WM), processing speed (PS), facial recognition (FCR), and verbal memory (VRM)) were assessed. All analyses adjusted for age, menopausal status, estradiol, and follicle-stimulating hormones. Results Contemporaneous networks yielded notable inverse between-node relations (edges) between interpersonal problems and reduced FCR and PS, and between depressed mood and lower FCR, VRM, or PS. Nodes that had the highest likelihood to bridge other constructs were positive affect, anxiety severity, WM, and VRM. Temporal networks produced edges consistent with the scar (v. vulnerability) hypotheses. Higher somatic symptoms were related to reduced PS and WM, and greater depressed mood was correlated with lower future PS and WM. Also, higher anxiety severity coincided with decreased future PS and WM. Greater positive affect was associated with stronger future PS, FCR, and WM. Also, positive affect had the strongest relations with other nodes. Conclusions Findings suggest the importance of targeting symptoms and cognitive functioning simultaneously.

Methods In a register-based cohort study of people born in Sweden 1980-1991 (n = 1 232 564), we investigated associations of mild and moderate/severe ID with any, violent and sexual crimes, and with assault victimization, stratified by comorbid autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We defined ID by attendance at a special school or registered diagnosis and obtained data on criminal convictions and injuries or deaths due to assaults from nationwide registers until end of 2013. Results Compared to people without ID, autism or ADHD, men and women with mild or moderate/severe ID and comorbid ADHD had elevated risks of violent crimes [range of hazard ratios (HRs) 4.4-10.4] and assault victimization (HRs 2.0-7.7). Women with mild ID without comorbidities or with comorbid autism also had elevated risks of violent crimes and victimization (HRs 1.8-4.6) compared to women without ID, autism or ADHD. The relative risks of sexual offending and victimization were elevated in men and women with ID without comorbidities (HRs 2.6-12.7). The highest risks for sexual offending in men (HRs 9.4-11.0) and for sexual assault victimization in women (HRs 11.0-17.1) related to ID and comorbid ADHD. Conclusions The elevated risk of violent offending and assault victimization in people with ID is largely explained by comorbid ADHD, whereas ID is independently associated with sexual crimes and victimization, even though absolute risks are low.

Cognitive remediation (CR) improves cognition and functioning in people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but its acceptability, and the impact of participants and treatment characteristics, remain to be investigated. Few studies provide a direct measure of acceptability, but treatment drop-out rates are often available and represent a valid surrogate. Method The systematic search conducted for the most comprehensive CR outcomes database for schizophrenia was updated in December 2020. Eligible studies were randomized clinical trials comparing CR with any other control condition in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and that also reported drop-out in treatment and control arms separately. Acceptability was measured as odd-ratios (OR) of drop-out. Results Of 2119 identified reports, 151 studies, reporting 169 comparisons between CR and control interventions with 10 477 participants were included in the analyses. The overall rate of drop-out was 16.58% for CR programs and 15.21% for control conditions. In the meta-analysis, no difference emerged between CR interventions and controls [OR 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.25, p = 0.177]. Factors improving acceptability were: inpatient only recruitment, participants with fewer years of education and lower premorbid IQ, the presence of all CR core elements, and the presence of techniques to transfer cognitive gains into real-world functioning. Conclusions CR for people diagnosed with schizophrenia is effective and has a good acceptability profile, similar to that of other evidence-based psychosocial interventions.

They have been linked to alterations in grey matter in several brain regions, but findings have been inconsistent. This may reflect the investigation of relatively small patient samples, and the confounding effects of chronic illness and exposure to antipsychotic medication. We sought to address these issues by investigating concurrently grey matter volumes (GMV) and cortical thickness (CTh) in a large sample of antipsychotic-naïve or minimally treated patients with First-Episode Schizophrenia (FES). Methods T1-weighted structural MRI brain scans were acquired from 180 antipsychotic-naïve or minimally treated patients recruited as part of the OPTiMiSE study. The sample was stratified into subgroups with (N = 88) or without (N = 92) Prominent Negative Symptoms (PMN), based on PANSS ratings at presentation. Regional GMV and CTh in the two groups were compared using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) and FreeSurfer (FS). Between-group differences were corrected for multiple comparisons via Family-Wise Error (FWE) and Monte Carlo z-field simulation respectively at p < 0.05 (2-tailed). Results The presence of PMN symptoms was associated with larger left inferior orbitofrontal volume (p = 0.03) and greater CTh in the left lateral orbitofrontal gyrus (p = 0.007), but reduced CTh in the left superior temporal gyrus (p = 0.009). Conclusions The findings highlight the role of orbitofrontal and temporal cortices in the pathogenesis of negative symptoms of Schizophrenia. As they were evident in generally untreated FEP patients, the results are unlikely to be related to effects of previous treatment or illness chronicity.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Accumulating evidence suggests an important association between deployment and the development of other mental health symptoms beyond post-traumatic stress disorder. Methods This study examined the prevalence of agoraphobia, anxiety, depression, and hostility symptoms in a cohort of Dutch ISAF veterans (N = 978) from pre-deployment up to 10 years after homecoming. The interaction of potential moderating factors with the change in mental health symptoms relative to pre-deployment was investigated at each time point. Results The probable prevalence of agoraphobia, anxiety, depression, and hostility symptoms significantly increased over time to respectively 6.5, 2.7, 3.5, and 6.2% at 10 years after deployment. Except for hostility symptoms, the probable prevalence at 10 years after deployment was the highest compared to all previous follow-up assessments. Importantly, less perceived social support after returning from deployment was found as a risk factor for all different mental health symptoms. Unit support was not associated with the development of mental health problems. Conclusions This study suggests a probable broad and long-term impact of deployment on the mental health of military service members. Due to the lack of a non-deployed control group, causal effects of deployment could not be demonstrated. Continued effort should nevertheless be made in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of mental health symptoms, even a decade after deployment. The findings also underscore the importance of social support after homecoming and its potential for the prevention of long-term mental health problems.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Importantly, the 5-HT system has also been generally implicated in reward processing, which has also been shown to be altered in AN. Methods In this double-blind crossover study, 22 individuals recAN and 25 healthy control participants (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing an established instrumental reward learning paradigm during acute tryptophan depletion (ATD; a dietary intervention that lowers central nervous 5-HT availability) as well as a sham depletion. Results On a behavioral level, the main effects of reward and ATD were evident, but no group differences were found. fMRI analyses revealed a group × ATD × reward level interaction in the ventral anterior insula during reward anticipation as well as in the medial orbitofrontal cortex during reward consumption. Discussion The precise pattern of results is suggestive of a 'normalization' of reward-related neural responses during ATD in recAN compared to HC. Our results lend further evidence to the 5-HT hypothesis of AN. Decreasing central nervous 5-HT synthesis and availability during ATD and possibly also by dieting may be a means to normalize 5-HT availability and associated brain processes.

The risk of suicide in BD is among the highest of all psychiatric conditions. Self-harm, including suicide attempts and non-suicidal self-injury, is a leading risk factor for suicide. Neuroimaging studies suggest reward circuits are implicated in both BD and self-harm; however, studies have yet to examine self-harm related resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) phenotypes within adolescent BD. Methods Resting-state fMRI data were analyzed for 141 adolescents, ages 13-20 years, including 38 with BD and lifetime self-harm (BDSH+), 33 with BD and no self-harm (BDSH-), and 70 healthy controls (HC). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala were examined as regions of interest in seed-to-voxel analyses. A general linear model was used to explore the bivariate correlations for each seed. Results BDSH- had increased positive rsFC between the left amygdala and left lateral occipital cortex, and between the right dlPFC and right frontal pole, and increased negative rsFC between the left amygdala and left superior frontal gyrus compared to BDSH+ and HC. BDSH+ had increased positive rsFC of the right OFC with the precuneus and left paracingulate gyrus compared to BDSH- and HC. Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence of altered reward-related rsFC in relation to self-harm in adolescents with BD. Between-group differences conveyed a combination of putative risk and resilience connectivity patterns. Future studies are warranted to evaluate changes in rsFC in response to treatment and related changes in self-harm.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This symptom may occur due to dysfunction in one or more sub-components of reward processing: motivation, consummatory experience and/or learning. However, the precise impairments remain elusive. Dissociating these components (ideally, using cross-species measures) and relating them to the subjective experience of anhedonia is critical as it may benefit fundamental biology research and novel drug development. Methods Using a battery of behavioural tasks based on rodent assays, we examined reward motivation (Joystick-Operated Runway Task, JORT; and Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task, EEfRT) and reward sensitivity (Sweet Taste Test) in a non-clinical population who scored high (N = 32) or low (N = 34) on an anhedonia questionnaire (Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale). Results Compared to the low anhedonia group, the high anhedonia group displayed marginal impairments in effort-based decision-making (EEfRT) and reduced reward sensitivity (Sweet Taste Test). However, we found no evidence of a difference between groups in physical effort exerted for reward (JORT). Interestingly, whilst the EEfRT and Sweet Taste Test correlated with anhedonia measures, they did not correlate with each other. This poses the question of whether there are subgroups within anhedonia; however, further work is required to directly test this hypothesis. Conclusions Our findings suggest that anhedonia is a heterogeneous symptom associated with impairments in reward sensitivity and effort-based decision-making.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

We aimed to investigate the associations between suicide attempt and sickness absence, disability pension and psychiatric patient care and to study the influence of previous psychiatric care and familial factors (genetics and shared environment) on the associations. Methods The study included 65 097 twins living in Sweden on 31st of December 2006, aged 19-60 years. The twins were followed 2007-2013 regarding sickness absence, disability pension, inpatient care or specialized outpatient care for a mental diagnosis. Cox regression models were performed for the whole sample, and conditional models for discordant twin pairs. The analyses were also stratified by psychiatric care before 2007. Results We found that suicide attempt predicted sickness absence, disability pension, and future mental diagnosis among the whole sample. The discordant twin pair analyses showed that the association between suicide attempt and sickness absence or disability pension was influenced by familial factors. Stratified analyses of individuals with or without psychiatric care before 2007 showed that previous psychiatric care had some impact on the associations. Conclusions A suicide attempt is a risk factor for work incapacity and psychiatric patient care. Familial factors and previous psychiatric care play a role in the associations between attempting suicide and work incapacity as well as psychiatric patient care. These factors are important when developing measures preventing work incapacity among those with a suicide attempt. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Body image concerns have the potential to be a powerful driver of feelings of vulnerability. Body image concerns are likely raised in patients with psychosis given the frequent weight gain. We examined for the first-time body esteem - the self-evaluation of appearance - in relation to symptom and psychological correlates in patients with current persecutory delusions. Methods One-hundred and fifteen patients with persecutory delusions in the context of non-affective psychosis completed assessments of body image, self-esteem, body mass index (BMI), psychiatric symptoms and well-being. Body esteem was also assessed in 200 individuals from the general population. Results Levels of body esteem were much lower in patients with psychosis than non-clinical controls (d = 1.2, p < 0.001). In patients, body esteem was lower in women than men, and in the overweight or obese BMI categories than the normal weight range. Body image concerns were associated with higher levels of depression (r = -0.55, p < 0.001), negative self-beliefs (r = -0.52, p < 0.001), paranoia (r = -0.25, p = 0.006) and hallucinations (r = -0.21, p = 0.025). Body image concerns were associated with lower levels of psychological wellbeing (r = 0.41, p < 0.001), positive self-beliefs (r = 0.40, p < 0.001), quality of life (r = 0.23, p = 0.015) and overall health (r = 0.31, p = 0.001). Conclusions Patients with current persecutory delusions have low body esteem. Body image concerns are associated with poorer physical and mental health, including more severe psychotic experiences. Improving body image for patients with psychosis is a plausible target of intervention, with the potential to result in a wide range of benefits.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted on randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) that reported on the efficacy and safety/tolerability of antipsychotics for the treatment of adults with MDD. Data of both monotherapy and adjunctive antipsychotic use were extracted, but analyzed separately using a random-effects model. Co-primary outcomes were study-defined-treatment response and intolerability-related discontinuation. We also illustrated the risk/benefit balance of antipsychotics for MDD, using two-dimensional graphs representing the primary efficacy and safety/tolerability outcome. Secondary outcomes included psychopathology, remission, all-cause-discontinuation, inefficacy-related discontinuation, and adverse events. Results Forty-five RCTs with 12 724 patients were included in the analysis. In monotherapy (studies = 13, n = 4375), amisulpride [1.99 (1.55-2.55)], sulpiride [1.50 (1.03-2.17)], and quetiapine [1.48 (1.23-1.78)] were significantly superior to placebo regarding treatment response. However, intolerability-related discontinuations were significantly higher compared to placebo with amisulpride and quetiapine. In adjunctive therapy (studies = 32, n = 8349), ziprasidone [1.80 (1.07-3.04)], risperidone [1.59 (1.19-2.14)], aripiprazole [1.54 (1.35-1.76)], brexpiprazole [1.41 (1.21-1.66)], cariprazine [1.27 (1.07-1.52)], and quetiapine [1.23 (1.08-1.41)] were significantly superior to placebo regarding treatment response. However, of these antipsychotics that were superior to placebo, only risperidone was equivalent to placebo regarding discontinuation due to intolerability, while the other antipsychotics were inferior. Conclusion Results suggest that there are significant differences regarding the risk/benefit ratio among antipsychotics for MDD, which should inform clinical care.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Most previous studies were performed with voxel- or surface-based morphometry which were univariate methods without considering spatial information across voxels/vertices. Methods Brain morphology was investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and source-based morphometry (SBM) in 1082 MDD patients and 990 healthy controls (HCs) from the REST-meta-MDD Consortium. We first examined group differences in regional grey matter (GM) volumes and structural covariance networks between patients and HCs. We then compared first-episode, drug-naïve (FEDN) patients, and recurrent patients. Additionally, we assessed the effects of symptom severity and illness duration on brain alterations. Results VBM showed decreased GM volume in various regions in MDD patients including the superior temporal cortex, anterior and middle cingulate cortex, inferior frontal cortex, and precuneus. SBM returned differences only in the prefrontal network. Comparisons between FEDN and recurrent MDD patients showed no significant differences by VBM, but SBM showed greater decreases in prefrontal, basal ganglia, visual, and cerebellar networks in the recurrent group. Moreover, depression severity was associated with volumes in the inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus, as well as the prefrontal network. Conclusions Simultaneous application of VBM and SBM methods revealed brain alterations in MDD patients and specified differences between recurrent and FEDN patients, which tentatively provide an effective multivariate method to identify potential neurobiological markers for depression.

Genetic variability is studied as a promising modulator of prognosis, thus novel approaches considering the polygenic nature of these complex phenotypes are required to unravel the mechanisms underlying the early progression of the disorder. Methods The sample comprised of 233 first-episode psychosis (FEP) subjects with clinical and cognitive data assessed periodically for a 2-year period and 150 matched controls. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, education attainment and cognitive performance were used to assess the genetic risk of FEP and to characterize their association with premorbid, baseline and progression of clinical and cognitive status. Results Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and cognitive performance PRSs were associated with an increased risk of FEP [false discovery rate (FDR) 0.027]. In FEP patients, increased cognitive PRSs were found for FEP patients with more cognitive reserve (FDR 0.037). PRSs reflecting a genetic liability for improved cognition were associated with a better course of symptoms, functionality and working memory (FDR 0.039). Moreover, the PRS of depression was associated with a worse trajectory of the executive function and the general cognitive status (FDR 0.001). Conclusions Our study provides novel evidence of the polygenic bases of psychosis and its clinical manifestation in its first stage. The consistent effect of cognitive PRSs on the early clinical progression suggests that the mechanisms underlying the psychotic episode and its severity could be partially independent.

Depression rating scores lessened in both groups during the admission, but at discharge, the personality disorder group continued to report higher subjective ratings. The personality disorder group also rated themselves as more cognitively impaired than the MDD-only group and unlike the MDD-only group, they did not report subjective improvements in cognitive function over the course of admission. Objective assessment of cognitive function demonstrated improvements in both groups. Conclusions In this study, the presence of a personality disorder was associated with greater subjective severity of depressive symptomatology and selected neurocognitive functioning, despite similar or lower objective severity in comparison with those with MDD. This finding has implications for understanding the patient journey through health care settings.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

However, the neural alterations that may contribute to this experience and eating behavior remain poorly understood. Methods We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure activation in the prefrontal cortices of 23 women with bulimia nervosa (BN) and 23 healthy controls (HC) during two tasks: a novel go/no-go task requiring inhibition of eating responses, and a standard go/no-go task requiring inhibition of button-pressing responses. Results Women with BN made more commission errors on both tasks. BN subgroups with the most severe LOC eating (n = 12) and those who felt most strongly that they binge ate during the task (n = 12) showed abnormally reduced bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) activation associated with eating-response inhibition. In the entire BN sample, lower eating-task activation in right vlPFC was related to more frequent and severe LOC eating, but no group differences in activation were detected on either task when this full sample was compared with HC. BN severity was unrelated to standard-task activation. Conclusions Results provide initial evidence that diminished PFC activation may directly contribute to more severe eating-specific control deficits in BN. Our findings support vmPFC and vlPFC dysfunction as promising treatment targets, and indicate that eating-specific tasks and fNIRS may be useful tools for identifying neural mechanisms underlying dysregulated eating.

Little is known about whether these differences are mood state-independent or influenced by acute symptom severity. Therefore, the aim of this study was (1) to replicate abnormalities in white matter microstructure in BD v. MDD and (2) to investigate whether these vary across depressed, euthymic, and manic mood. Methods In this cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging study, n = 136 patients with BD were compared to age- and sex-matched MDD patients and healthy controls (HC) (n = 136 each). Differences in FA were investigated using tract-based spatial statistics. Using interaction models, the influence of acute symptom severity and mood state on the differences between patient groups were tested. Results Analyses revealed a main effect of diagnosis on FA across all three groups (ptfce-FWE = 0.003). BD patients showed reduced FA compared to both MDD (ptfce-FWE = 0.005) and HC (ptfce-FWE < 0.001) in large bilateral clusters. These consisted of several white matter tracts previously described in the literature, including commissural, association, and projection tracts. There were no significant interaction effects between diagnosis and symptom severity or mood state (all ptfce-FWE > 0.704). Conclusions Results indicated that the difference between BD and MDD was independent of depressive and manic symptom severity and mood state. Disruptions in white matter microstructure in BD might be a trait effect of the disorder. The potential of FA values to be used as a biomarker to differentiate BD from MDD should be further addressed in future studies using longitudinal designs.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Here, we study potentially state- and trait-related white matter diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) abnormalities along the adolescent-onset psychosis continuum to address this need. Methods Forty-eight individuals with ADO-SCZ (20 female/28 male), 15 individuals with psychotic ADO-BPD (7 female/8 male), and 35 healthy controls (HCs, 18 female/17 male) underwent dMRI and clinical assessments. Maps of extracellular free-water (FW) and fractional anisotropy of cellular tissue (FAT) were compared between individuals with psychosis and HCs using tract-based spatial statistics and FSL's Randomise. FAT and FW values were extracted, averaged across all voxels that demonstrated group differences, and then utilized to test for the influence of age, medication, age of onset, duration of illness, symptom severity, and intelligence. Results Individuals with adolescent-onset psychosis exhibited pronounced FW and FAT abnormalities compared to HCs. FAT reductions were spatially more widespread in ADO-SCZ. FW increases, however, were only present in psychotic ADO-BPD. In HCs, but not in individuals with adolescent-onset psychosis, FAT was positively related to age. Conclusions We observe evidence for cellular (FAT) and extracellular (FW) white matter abnormalities in adolescent-onset psychosis. Although cellular white matter abnormalities were more prominent in ADO-SCZ, such alterations may reflect a shared trait, i.e. neurodevelopmental pathology, present across the psychosis spectrum. Extracellular abnormalities were evident in psychotic ADO-BPD, potentially indicating a more dynamic, state-dependent brain reaction to psychosis.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Considering the dearth of ED research among those of lower SES, this study examined (1) the overall association between SES and ED prevalence, and (2) ED prevalence in the context of four relevant social identities (i.e. SES, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity) from an intersectional perspective, as unique combinations of multiple social identities may differentially influence risk. Methods A sample of 120 891 undergraduate/graduate students from the Healthy Minds Study self-reported family SES with a single-item question, gender identity, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity, and were screened for ED risk. Results Participants of lower SES had 1.27 (95% CI 1.25-1.30) times greater prevalence of a positive ED screen than those of higher SES. Substantial heterogeneity was observed across the four social identities beyond the association with SES. For example, positive ED screens were particularly common among lower SES, Latinx, sexual minority cisgender men and women, with 52% of bisexual men and 52% of lesbian women of Latinx ethnicity and lower SES screening positive. Conclusions Although positive ED screens were more common among undergraduate/graduate students of lower SES, the particularly high ED risk reported by certain groups of lower SES with multiple minority identities reinforces the importance of investigating multi-layered constructs of identity when identifying groups at disproportionate risk.

Despite their tolerability profile and potential beneficial effects, baseline exposure to antidepressants (AD) in CHR-P has surprisingly received far less attention as a potential risk modulator for transition to psychosis. The current systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to fix such a knowledge gap. Methods Systematic scrutiny of Medline and Cochrane library, performed up to 1 August 2021, searching for English-language studies on CHR-P reporting numeric data about the sample, the transition outcome at a predefined follow-up time and raw data on AD baseline exposure in relation to such outcome. Results Of 1942 identified records, 16 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. 26% of the participants were already exposed to AD at baseline; at the end of the follow-up 13.5% (95% CI 10.2-17.1%) of them (n = 448) transitioned to psychosis against 21.0% (18.9 to 23.3%) of non-AD exposed CHR-P (n = 1371). CHR-P participants who were already under AD treatment at baseline had a lower risk of transition than non-AD exposed CHR-P. The RR was 0.71 (95% CI 0.56-0.90) in the fixed-effects model (z = -2.79; p = 0.005), and 0.78 (0.58-1.05) in the random-effects model (z = -1.77; p = 0.096; tau-squared = 0.059). There was no relevant heterogeneity (Cochran's Q = 18.45; df = 15; p = 0.239; I2 = 18.7%).

We aimed to examine associations between stable and dynamic aspects of sleep and mood in people with BD, and assess individual differences in the strength of these associations. Methods Participants (N = 649) with BD-I (N = 400) and BD-II (N = 249) provided weekly self-reports of insomnia, depression and (hypo)mania symptoms using the True Colours online monitoring tool for 21 months. Dynamic structural equation models were used to examine the interplay between weekly reports of insomnia and mood. The effects of clinical and demographic characteristics on associations were also assessed. Results Increased variability in insomnia symptoms was associated with increased mood variability. In the sample as a whole, we found strong evidence of bidirectional relationships between insomnia and depressive symptoms but only weak support for bidirectional relationships between insomnia and (hypo)manic symptoms. We found substantial variability between participants in the strength of prospective associations between insomnia and mood, which depended on age, gender, bipolar subtype, and a history of rapid cycling. Conclusions Our results highlight the importance of monitoring sleep in people with BD. However, researchers and clinicians investigating the association between sleep and mood should consider subgroup differences in this relationship. Advances in digital technology mean that intensive longitudinal data on sleep and mood are becoming increasingly available. Novel methods to analyse these data present an exciting opportunity for furthering our understanding of BD.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

We therefore performed a detailed examination of power in trials of psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders. Methods We extracted data from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Mental Health). We focused on continuous efficacy outcomes and estimated power to detect predetermined effect sizes (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.20-0.80, primary SMD = 0.40) and meta-analytic effect sizes (ESMA). We performed meta-regression to estimate the influence of including underpowered studies in meta-analyses. Results We included 256 reviews with 10 686 meta-analyses and 47 384 studies. Statistical power for continuous efficacy outcomes was very low across intervention and disorder types (overall median [IQR] power for SMD = 0.40: 0.32 [0.19-0.54]; for ESMA: 0.23 [0.09-0.58]), only reaching conventionally acceptable levels (80%) for SMD = 0.80. Median power to detect the ESMA was higher in treatment-as-usual (TAU)/waitlist-controlled (0.49-0.63) or placebo-controlled (0.12-0.38) trials than in trials comparing active treatments (0.07-0.13). Adequately-powered studies produced smaller effect sizes than underpowered studies (B = -0.06, p 0.001). Conclusions Power to detect both predetermined and meta-analytic effect sizes in psychiatric trials was low across all interventions and disorders examined. Consistent with the presence of reporting bias, underpowered studies produced larger effect sizes than adequately-powered studies.

However, no studies have analyzed the dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) of insular Mubregions and its association with personality traits in BD with suicidal behaviors. Therefore, we investigated the alterations of dFC variability in insular subregions and personality characteristics in BD patients with a recent suicide attempt (SA). Methods Thirty unmedicated BD patients with SA, 38 patients without SA (NSA) and 35 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs) were included. The sliding-window analysis was used to evaluate whole-brain dFC for each insular subregion seed. We assessed between-group differences of psychological characteristics on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2. Finally, a multivariate regression model was adopted to predict the severity of suicidality. Results Compared to NSA and HCs, the SA group exhibited decreased dFC variability values between the left dorsal anterior insula and the left anterior cerebellum. These dFC variability values could also be utilized to predict the severity of suicidality (r = 0.456, p = 0.031), while static functional connectivity values were not appropriate for this prediction. Besides, the SA group scored significantly higher on the schizophrenia clinical scales (p < 0.001) compared with the NSA group. Conclusions Our findings indicated that the dysfunction of insula-cerebellum connectivity may underlie the neural basis of SA in BD patients, and highlighted the dFC variability values could be considered a neuromarker for predictive models of the severity of suicidality. Moreover, the psychiatric features may increase the vulnerability of suicidal behavior.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Several neural predictors of CBT outcome for anxiety-related disorders have been proposed, but previous results are inconsistent. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies investigating whole-brain predictors of CBT outcome in anxiety-related disorders (17 studies, n = 442). Results Across different tasks, we observed that brain response in a network of regions involved in salience and interoception processing, encompassing fronto-insular (the right inferior frontal gyrus-anterior insular cortex) and fronto-limbic (the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex-dorsal anterior cingulate cortex) cortices was strongly associated with a positive CBT outcome. Conclusions Our results suggest that there are robust neural predictors of CBT outcome in anxiety-related disorders that may eventually lead (probably in combination with other data) to develop personalized approaches for the treatment of these mental disorders.

However, the methodological heterogeneity of previous studies made it difficult to determine the functional and etiological implications of specific alterations in brain connectivity. We previously reported alterations in psychophysiological interaction measures during emotional face processing, distinguishing depressive pathology from at-risk/resilient and healthy states. Here, we extended these findings by effective connectivity analyses in the same sample to establish a refined neural model of emotion processing in depression. Methods Thirty-seven patients with MDD, 45 first-degree relatives of patients with MDD and 97 healthy controls performed a face-matching task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We used dynamic causal modeling to estimate task-dependent effective connectivity at the subject level. Parametric empirical Bayes was performed to quantify group differences in effective connectivity. Results MDD patients showed decreased effective connectivity from the left amygdala and left lateral prefrontal cortex to the fusiform gyrus compared to relatives and controls, whereas patients and relatives showed decreased connectivity from the right orbitofrontal cortex to the left insula and from the left orbitofrontal cortex to the right fusiform gyrus compared to controls. Relatives showed increased connectivity from the anterior cingulate cortex to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to patients and controls. Conclusions Our results suggest that the depressive state alters top-down control of higher visual regions during face processing. Alterations in connectivity within the cognitive control network present potential risk or resilience mechanisms.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods Data collected from adolescent girls (N = 496; M age = 13.02, s.d. = 0.73) who completed a diagnostic interview annually over an 8-year period were used to address these aims. Results For all four eating disorders, compensatory weight-control behaviors were the first behavioral symptom to emerge and weight/shape overvaluation was the first cognitive symptom to emerge. Moreover, lower-than-expected BMI predicted future AN onset, binge eating and all cognitive symptoms predicted future BN onset, weight/shape overvaluation predicted future BED onset, and compensatory behavior and all cognitive symptoms predicted future PD onset. These predictive effects were small-to-large in magnitude. Collectively, prodromal symptoms predicted an eating disorder onset with 83-87% accuracy. Conclusions Results suggest that compensatory weight-control behaviors and weight/shape overvaluation typically emerge before other prodromal symptoms in all eating disorders during adolescence. Moreover, different prodromal symptoms seem to predict future onset of different eating disorders. Screening adolescent girls for these prodromal symptoms and implementing indicated prevention programs designed to reduce these symptoms may prove effective in preventing future onset of eating disorders.

The ACTMuS trial examined whether Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) as an adjunct to usual care improved QoL for such patients as compared to usual care alone. Methods This two-arm, randomised, multicentre, parallel design recruited 155 patients with MD (Hospital and Depression Scale © 8 for depression or © 8 for anxiety and Montreal Cognitive Assessment © 21/30). Participants were randomised, using random block sizes, to one of two groups: standard medical care (SMC) (n = 78) or to ACT in addition to SMC (n = 77), and were followed up to 9 weeks. The primary outcome was QoL, assessed by the Individualised Neuromuscular Quality of Life Questionnaire (INQoL), the average of five subscales, at 9-weeks. Trial registration was NCT02810028. Results 138 people (89.0%) were followed up at 9-weeks. At all three time points, the adjusted group difference favoured the intervention group and was significant with moderate to large effect sizes. Secondary outcomes (mood, functional impairment, aspects of psychological flexibility) also showed significant differences between groups at week 9. Conclusions ACT in addition to usual care was effective in improving QoL and other psychological and social outcomes in patients with MD. A 6 month follow up will determine the extent to which gains are maintained.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Whether hallucinations also index suicidal behaviour risk in groups at elevated risk of suicidal behaviour, namely in individuals with a sexual assault history, remains to be seen. Aims We assessed whether hallucinations were markers of risk for suicidal behaviour among individuals with a sexual assault history. Methods Using the cross-sectional 2007 (N = 7403) and 2014 (N = 7546) Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys, we assessed for an interaction between sexual assault and hallucinations in terms of the odds of suicide attempt, as well as directly comparing the prevalence of suicide attempt in individuals with a sexual assault history with v. without hallucinations. Results Individuals with a sexual assault history had increased odds of hallucinations and suicide attempt compared to individuals without a sexual assault history in both samples. There was a significant interaction between sexual assault and hallucinations in terms of the odds of suicide attempt. In total, 14-19% of individuals with a sexual assault history who did not report hallucinations had one or more suicide attempt. This increased to 33-52% of individuals with a sexual assault history who did report hallucinations (2007, aOR = 2.85, 1.71-4.75; 2014, aOR = 4.52, 2.78-7.35). Conclusions Hallucinations are a risk marker for suicide attempt even among individuals with an elevated risk of suicidal behaviour, specifically individuals with a sexual assault history. This finding highlights the clinical significance of hallucinations with regard to suicidal behaviour risk, even among high-risk populations.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

However, medication response in pediatric BD is variable and not well predicted by clinical characteristics. Methods A total of 121 youth with early course BD (acute manic/mixed episode) were prospectively recruited and randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with quetiapine (n = 71) or lithium (n = 50). Participants completed structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline before treatment and 1 week after treatment initiation, and brain morphometric features were extracted for each individual based on MRI scans. Positive antimanic treatment response at week 6 was defined as an over 50% reduction of Young Mania Rating Scale scores from baseline. Two-stage deep learning prediction model was established to distinguish responders and non-responders based on different feature sets. Results Pre-treatment morphometry and morphometric changes occurring during the first week can both independently predict treatment outcome of quetiapine and lithium with balanced accuracy over 75% (all p < 0.05). Combining brain morphometry at baseline and week 1 allows prediction with the highest balanced accuracy (quetiapine: 83.2% and lithium: 83.5%). Predictions in the quetiapine and lithium group were found to be driven by different morphometric patterns. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that pre-treatment morphometric measures and acute brain morphometric changes can serve as medication response predictors in pediatric BD. Brain morphometric features may provide promising biomarkers for developing biologically-informed treatment outcome prediction and patient stratification tools for BD treatment development.

Dysfunction in neural reward circuits is thought to contribute to anhedonia. However, whether laboratory-based assessments of anhedonia and reward-related neural function translate to adolescents' subjective affective experiences in real-world contexts remains unclear. Methods We recruited a sample of adolescents (n = 82; ages 12-18; mean = 15.83) who varied in anhedonia and measured the relationships among clinician-rated and self-reported anhedonia, behaviorally assessed reward learning ability, neural response to monetary reward and loss (as assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging), and repeated ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) in daily life. Results Anhedonia was associated with lower mean PA and higher mean NA across the 5-day EMA period. Anhedonia was not related to impaired behavioral reward learning, but low PA was associated with reduced nucleus accumbens response during reward anticipation and reduced medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) response during reward outcome. Greater mean NA was associated with increased mPFC response to loss outcome. Conclusions Traditional laboratory-based measures of anhedonia were associated with lower subjective PA and higher subjective NA in youths' daily lives. Lower subjective PA and higher subjective NA were associated with decreased reward-related striatal functioning. Higher NA was also related to increased mPFC activity to loss. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that laboratory-based measures of anhedonia translate to real-world contexts and that subjective ratings of PA and NA may be associated with neural response to reward and loss.

Using a randomized controlled trial, we tested the efficacy of a group cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention for SA (CBT-SA) that we developed for youth who experienced the first episode of psychosis (FEP). For our primary outcome, we hypothesized that compared to the active control of group cognitive remediation (CR), the CBT-SA group would show a reduction in SA that would be maintained at 3- and 6-month follow-ups. For secondary outcomes, it was hypothesized that the CBT-SA group would show a reduction of positive and negative symptoms and improvements in recovery and functioning. Method Ninety-six patients with an FEP and SA, recruited from five different FEP programs in the Montreal area, were randomized to 13 weekly group sessions of either CBT-SA or CR intervention. Results Linear mixed models revealed that multiple measures of SA significantly reduced over time, but with no significant group differences. Positive and negative symptoms, as well as functioning improved over time, with negative symptoms and functioning exhibiting a greater reduction in the CBT-SA group. Conclusions While SA decreased over time with both interventions, a positive effect of the CBT-SA intervention on measures of negative symptoms, functioning, and self-reported recovery at follow-up suggests that our intervention had a positive effect that extended beyond symptoms specific to SA.

This study aimed to test the effect of juvenile justice involvement on adult criminal outcomes. Methods Analyses were based on a prospective, population-based study of 1420 children followed up to eight times during childhood (ages 9-16; 6674 observations) about juvenile justice involvement in the late 1990 and early 2000s. Participants were followed up years later to assess adult criminality, using self-report and official records. A propensity score (i.e. inverse probability) weighting approach was used that approximated an experimental design by balancing potentially confounding characteristics between children with v. without juvenile justice involvement. Results Between-groups differences on variables that elicit a juvenile justice referral (e.g. violence, property offenses, status offenses, and substance misuse) were attenuated after applying propensity-based inverse probability weights. Participants with a history of juvenile justice involvement were more likely to have later official and violent felony charges, and to self-report police contact and spending time in jail (ORs from 2.5 to 3.3). Residential juvenile justice involvement was associated with the highest risk of both, later official criminal records and self-reported criminality (ORs from 5.1 to 14.5). Sensitivity analyses suggest that our findings are likely robust to potential unobserved confounders. Conclusions Juvenile justice involvement was associated with increased risk of adult criminality, with residential services associated with highest risk.

The present study aimed to determine whether there are more than one covariant trajectory of social anxiety and positive symptoms in the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study cohort (NAPLS 2) and, if so, to test whether the different trajectory subgroups differ in terms of genetic and environmental risk factors for psychotic disorders and general functional outcome. Methods In total, 764 CHR individuals were evaluated at baseline for social anxiety and psychosis risk symptom severity and followed up every 6 months for 2 years. Application of group-based multi-trajectory modeling discerned three subgroups based on the covariant trajectories of social anxiety and positive symptoms over 2 years. Results One of the subgroups showed sustained social anxiety over time despite moderate recovery in positive symptoms, while the other two showed recovery of social anxiety below clinically significant thresholds, along with modest to moderate recovery in positive symptom severity. The trajectory group with sustained social anxiety had poorer long-term global functional outcomes than the other trajectory groups. In addition, compared with the other two trajectory groups, membership in the group with sustained social anxiety was predicted by higher levels of polygenic risk for schizophrenia and environmental stress exposures. Conclusions Together, these analyses indicate differential relevance of sustained v. remitting social anxiety symptoms in the CHR-P population, which in turn may carry implications for differential intervention strategies.

A dimensional approach is warranted to delineate their mechanistic interplay across MPDs. Methods This single site study included a total of 1543 participants (1058 patients and 485 controls). In total, 1169 participants underwent diffusion tensor and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (745 patients and 379 controls completed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) assessed structural and functional connectivity, respectively. Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α] were obtained in 325 participants using blood samples collected with 24 h of scanning. Group differences were determined for main measures, and correlation and mediation analyses and machine learning prediction modeling were performed. Results Executive deficits were associated with decreased FA, increased ReHo, and elevated IL-1β and IL-6 levels across MPDs, compared to controls. FA and ReHo alterations in fronto-limbic-striatal regions contributed to executive deficits. IL-1β mediated the association between FA and cognition, and IL-6 mediated the relationship between ReHo and cognition. Executive cognition was better predicted by both brain connectivity and cytokine measures than either one alone for FA-IL-1β and ReHo-IL-6. Conclusions Transdiagnostic associations among brain connectivity, inflammation, and executive cognition exist across MPDs, implicating common neurobiological substrates and mechanisms for executive deficits in MPDs. Further, inflammation-related brain dysconnectivity within fronto-limbic-striatal regions may represent a transdiagnostic dimension underlying executive dysfunction that could be leveraged to advance treatment.

We examine the longitudinal associations between (a) social and psychological risk factors in childhood and adolescent dual-harm and (b) adolescent dual-harm and social and mental health impairments in early adulthood. Methods Participants (N = 1482) are from a prospective longitudinal community-representative study. Dual-, self-, and other-harm were self-reported at ages 13, 15, and 17. Social and psychological risk factors in childhood were assessed between 7 and 11; early adult correlates at age 20. Groups with dual-harm, self-harm only, other-harm only, and no harm were compared. Results Between 13 and 17, 7.2% of adolescents reported dual-harm (self-harm only: 16.2%; other-harm only: 13.3%). Some childhood risk factors (e.g. sensation-seeking, parental divorce, victimization by peers) characterized all harm groups; others were common to the dual- and self-harm (anxiety/depressive symptoms, relational aggression) or dual- and other-harm groups only (low self-control, substance use, delinquency). Adolescents with dual-harm had reported more physical aggression and harsh parenting, and lower school bonding in childhood than any other group. In early adulthood, they reported more anxiety/depressive symptoms, psychopathy symptoms, homicidal ideations, delinquency, and victimization experiences than any other group. Conclusions Adolescent dual-harm follows psychological problems and social disconnection in childhood and signals risk of psychopathology and isolation in early adulthood. To curb the burden from dual-harm, interventions must target adolescents, families, peer networks, and school environments. Differentiating youth with dual-harm from those with single-harm is important for developing personalized treatments.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Data from population-representative panel surveys with multiple waves including pre-COVID data investigating risk and protective factors are still rare. Methods In a stratified random sample of the German household population (n = 6684), we conducted survey-weighted multiple linear regressions to determine the association of various psychological risk and protective factors assessed between 2015 and 2020 with changes in psychological distress [(PD; measured via Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4)] from pre-pandemic (average of 2016 and 2019) to peri-pandemic (both 2020 and 2021) time points. Control analyses on PD change between two pre-pandemic time points (2016 and 2019) were conducted. Regularized regressions were computed to inform on which factors were statistically most influential in the multicollinear setting. Results PHQ-4 scores in 2020 (M = 2.45) and 2021 (M = 2.21) were elevated compared to 2019 (M = 1.79). Several risk factors (catastrophizing, neuroticism, and asking for instrumental support) and protective factors (perceived stress recovery, positive reappraisal, and optimism) were identified for the peri-pandemic outcomes. Control analyses revealed that in pre-pandemic times, neuroticism and optimism were predominantly related to PD changes. Regularized regression mostly confirmed the results and highlighted perceived stress recovery as most consistent influential protective factor across peri-pandemic outcomes. Conclusions We identified several psychological risk and protective factors related to PD outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparison of pre-pandemic data stresses the relevance of longitudinal assessments to potentially reconcile contradictory findings. Implications and suggestions for targeted prevention and intervention programs during highly stressful times such as pandemics are discussed.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods Depressed volunteers (n = 71) were recruited into a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study to explore the effects of a daily, 4-week intake of a multispecies probiotic or placebo on emotional processing and cognition. Mood, anxiety, positive and negative affect, sleep, salivary cortisol and serum C-reactive peptide (CRP) were assessed before and after supplementation. Results Compared with placebo, probiotic intake increased accuracy at identifying faces expressing all emotions (+12%, p < 0.05, total n = 51) and vigilance to neutral faces (mean difference between groups = 12.28 ms ± 6.1, p < 0.05, total n = 51). Probiotic supplementation also reduced reward learning (-9%, p < 0.05, total n = 51), and interference word recall on the auditory verbal learning task (-18%, p < 0.05, total n = 50), but did not affect other aspects of cognitive performance. Although actigraphy revealed a significant group × night-time activity interaction, follow up analysis was not significant (p = 0.094). Supplementation did not alter salivary cortisol or circulating CRP concentrations. Probiotic intake significantly reduced (-50% from baseline, p < 0.05, n = 35) depression scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, but these did not correlate with the changes in emotional processing. Conclusions The impartiality to positive and negative emotional stimuli or reward after probiotic supplementation have not been observed with conventional antidepressant therapies. Further studies are required to elucidate the significance of these changes with regard to the mood-improving action of the current probiotic.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Group CPT has been shown to be less efficacious than individual CPT, however, evidence regarding real-world effectiveness is limited. Methods We conducted a retrospective, observational, comparative effectiveness study including veterans that received at least eight sessions of group CPT, individual CPT, or individual PE, and were discharged from PTSD residential treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs between 1 October 2015, and 30 September 2020. PTSD symptom severity was assessed with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and treatments delivered in a group (CPT) or individual (CPT or PE) setting were compared at discharge and 4-month post-discharge follow-up. Results Of 6735 veterans, 3888 [653 women (17%), median (IQR) age 45 (35-55) years] received individual and 2847 [206 women (7.2%), median (IQR) age 42 (34-54)] received group therapy.

Yet, evidence for associations of neuroimaging markers of vascular brain disease with depressive symptoms is inconclusive. We examined the associations of neuroimaging markers and depressive symptoms in a large population-based study of middle-aged and elderly persons over time. Methods A total of 4943 participants (mean age = 64.6 ± 11.1 years, 55.7% women) from the Rotterdam Study were included. At baseline, total brain volume, gray matter volume, white matter volume, white matter hyperintensities volume, cortical infarcts, lacunar infarcts, microbleeds, white matter fractional anisotropy, and mean diffusivity (MD) were measured with a brain MRI (1.5T). Depressive symptoms were assessed twice with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (median follow-up time: 5.5 years, IQR = 0.9). To assess temporal associations of neuroimaging markers and depressive symptoms, linear mixed models were used. Results A smaller total brain volume (β = -0.107, 95% CI -0.192 to -0.022), larger white matter hyperintensities volume (β = 0.047, 95% CI 0.010-0.084), presence of cortical infarcts (β = 0.194, 95% CI 0.047-0.341), and higher MD levels (β = 0.060, 95% CI 0.022-0.098) were cross-sectionally associated with more depressive symptoms. Longitudinal analyses showed that small total brain volume (β = -0.091, 95% CI -0.167 to -0.015) and presence of cortical infarcts (β = 0.168, 95% CI 0.022-0.314) were associated with increasing depressive symptoms over time. After stratification on age, effect sizes were more pronounced at older ages. Conclusions Neuroimaging markers of white matter microstructural damage were associated with depressive symptoms longitudinally in this study of middle-aged and elderly persons. These associations were more pronounced at older ages, providing evidence for the role of white matter structure in late-life depressive symptomatology.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

We aimed to determine the behavioral hallmarks of ANMDARE with the use of systematic neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessments. Methods A prospective study was conducted, with 160 patients admitted to the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery of Mexico, who fulfilled criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis and/or red flags along a time window of seven years. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) antibodies against the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR were processed with rat brain immunohistochemistry and cell-based assays with NMDA expressing cells. Systematic cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and functional assessments were conducted before knowing NMDAR antibodies results. A multivariate analysis was used to compare patients with and without definite ANMDARE according to antibodies in CSF. Results After obtaining the CSF antibodies results in 160 consecutive cases, 100 patients were positive and classified as having definite ANMDARE. The most frequent neuropsychiatric patterns were psychosis (81%), delirium (75%), catatonia (69%), anxiety-depression (65%), and mania (27%). Cognition was significantly impaired. A total of 34% of the patients had a predominantly neuropsychiatric presentation without seizures. After multivariate analysis, the clinical hallmarks of ANMDARE consisted of a catatonia-delirium comorbidity, tonic-clonic seizures, and orolingual dyskinesia. Conclusions Our study supports the notion of a neurobehavioral phenotype of ANMDARE characterized by a fluctuating course with psychotic and affective symptoms, catatonic signs, and global cognitive dysfunction, often accompanied by seizures and dyskinesia. The catatonia-delirium comorbidity could be a distinctive neurobehavioral phenotype of ANMDARE.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Different cognitive deficits underpin these psychopathologies, which could be subjected to intervention to alter the course of the disorder. Understanding domain-specific mediating effects of cognition is essential for developing targeted intervention strategies. However, the high degree of inter-correlation among different cognitive functions hinders elucidation of individual effects. Methods In the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, 218 individuals with ASD were matched with 872 non-ASD controls on sex, age, race, and socioeconomic status. Participants of this cohort were deeply and broadly phenotyped on neurocognitive abilities and dimensional psychopathology. Using structural equation modeling, inter-correlation among cognitive domains were adjusted before mediation analysis on outcomes of multi-domain psychopathology and functional level. Results While social cognition, complex cognition, and memory each had a unique pattern of mediating effect on psychopathology domains in ASD, none had significant effects on the functional level. In contrast, executive function was the only cognitive domain that exerted a generalized negative impact on every psychopathology domain (p factor, anxious-misery, psychosis, fear, and externalizing), as well as functional level. Conclusions Executive function has a unique association with the severity of comorbid psychopathology in ASD, and could be a target of interventions. As executive dysfunction occurs variably in ASD, our result also supports the clinical utility of assessing executive function for prognostic purposes.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Their causes and recovery likely differ from physical and cognitive skills, due to disruption to developing brain networks and the influence of the child's environment. Despite increasing recognition of post-injury behavioral and social problems, there exists a paucity of research regarding the incidence of social impairment, and factors predicting risk and resilience in the social domain over time since injury. Methods Using a prospective, longitudinal design, and a bio-psychosocial framework, we studied children with TBI (n = 107) at baseline (pre-injury function), 6 months, 1 and 2-years post-injury. We assessed intellectual ability, attention/executive function, social cognition, social communication and socio-emotional function. Children underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 2-8 weeks post-injury. Parents rated their child's socio-emotional function and their own mental health, family function and perceived burden. Results We distinguished five social recovery profiles, characterized by a complex interplay between environment and pre- and post-TBI factors, with injury factors playing a lesser role. Resilience in social competence was linked to intact family and parent function, intact pre-injury adaptive abilities, post-TBI cognition and social participation. Vulnerability in the social domain was related to poor pre- and post-injury adaptive abilities, greater behavioral concerns, and poorer pre- and post-injury parent health and family function. Conclusions We identified five distinct social recovery trajectories post-child-TBI, each characterized by a unique biopsychosocial profile, highlighting the importance of comprehensive social assessment and understanding of factors contributing to social impairment, to target resources and interventions to children at highest risk.

However, its relationship to genetic risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in the general population is unknown. Here, we investigate associations between attainment of early-life language and motor development milestones and genetic liability to autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Methods We use data from a genotyped sub-set (N = 25699) of children in the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). We calculate polygenic scores (PGS) for autism, ADHD, and schizophrenia and predict maternal reports of children's age at first walking, first words, and first sentences, motor delays (18 months), and language delays and a generalised measure of concerns about development (3 years). We use linear and probit regression models in a multi-group framework to test for sex differences. Results We found that ADHD PGS were associated with earlier walking age (β = -0.033, padj < 0.001) in both males and females. Additionally, autism PGS were associated with later walking (β = 0.039, padj = 0.006) in females only. No robust associations were observed for schizophrenia PGS or between any neurodevelopmental PGS and measures of language developmental milestone attainment. Conclusions Genetic liabilities for neurodevelopmental disorders show some specific associations with the age at which children first walk unsupported. Associations are small but robust and, in the case of autism PGS, differentiated by sex. These findings suggest that early-life motor developmental milestone attainment is associated with genetic liability to ADHD and autism in the general population.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods Prediction of need for care and health care outcomes was examined prospectively as a function of the contextual clinical characterization diagnostic framework in a prospective general population cohort (n = 6646 at baseline), interviewed four times between 2007 and 2018 (NEMESIS-2). Measures of need, service use, and use of medication were predicted as a function of any of 13 DSM-IV diagnoses, both separately and in combination with clinical characterization across multiple domains: social circumstances/demographics, symptom dimensions, physical health, clinical/etiological factors, staging, and polygenic risk scores (PRS). Effect sizes were expressed as population attributable fractions. Results Any prediction of DSM-diagnosis in relation to need and outcome in separate models was entirely reducible to components of contextual clinical characterization in joint models, particularly the component of transdiagnostic symptom dimensions (a simple score of the number of anxiety, depression, mania, and psychosis symptoms) and staging (subthreshold, incidence, persistence), and to a lesser degree clinical factors (early adversity, family history, suicidality, slowness at interview, neuroticism, and extraversion), and sociodemographic factors. Clinical characterization components in combination predicted more than any component in isolation. PRS did not meaningfully contribute to any clinical characterization model. Conclusion A transdiagnostic framework of contextual clinical characterization is of more value to patients than a categorical system of algorithmic ordering of psychopathology.

Recent advances in network analysis provide a method of examining the relative centrality of BPD symptoms, as well as examine the replicability of findings across samples. Additionally, despite the increase in research supporting the validity of BPD in adolescents, clinicians are reluctant to diagnose BPD in adolescents. Establishing the replicability of the syndrome across adolescents and adults informs clinical practice and research. This study examined the stability of BPD symptom networks and centrality of symptoms across samples varying in age and clinical characteristics. Methods Cross-sectional analyses of BPD symptoms from semi-structured diagnostic interviews from the Collaborative Longitudinal Study of Personality Disorders (CLPS), the Methods to Improve Diagnostic Assessment and Service (MIDAS) study, and an adolescent clinical sample. Network attributes, including edge (partial association) strength and node (symptom) expected influence, were compared. Results The three networks were largely similar and strongly correlated. Affective instability and identity disturbance emerged as relatively central symptoms across the three samples, and relationship difficulties across adult networks. Differences in network attributes were more evident between networks varying both in age and in BPD symptom severity level. Conclusions Findings highlight the relative importance of affective, identity, and relationship symptoms, consistent with several leading theories of BPD. The network structure of BPD symptoms appears generally replicable across multiple large samples including adolescents and adults, providing further support for the validity of the diagnosis across these developmental phases.

Methods Data come from the World Mental Health International College Student Initiative (WMH-ICS). Web-based surveys conducted in nine countries (n = 20 427) assessed lifetime and 12-month mental disorders, 12-month role impairment, and seven types of CAs occurring before the age of 18: parental psychopathology, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, neglect, bullying victimization, and dating violence. Poisson regressions estimated associations using three dimensions of CA exposure: type, number, and frequency. Results Overall, 75.8% of students reported exposure to at least one CA. In multivariate regression models, lifetime onset and 12-month mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders were all associated with either the type, number, or frequency of CAs. In contrast, none of these associations was significant when predicting disorder persistence. Of the three CA dimensions examined, only frequency was associated with severe role impairment among students with 12-month disorders. Population-attributable risk simulations suggest that 18.7-57.5% of 12-month disorders and 16.3% of severe role impairment among those with disorders were associated with these CAs. Conclusion CAs are associated with an elevated risk of onset and impairment among 12-month cases of diverse mental disorders but are not involved in disorder persistence. Future research on the associations of CAs with psychopathology should include fine-grained assessments of CA exposure and attempt to trace out modifiable intervention targets linked to mechanisms of associations with lifetime psychopathology and burden of 12-month mental disorders.

The mean GRID-HAMD scores in the UP-TAU and WL-TAU groups were 16.15 (s.d. = 4.90) and 17.06 (s.d. = 6.46) at baseline and 12.14 (s.d. = 5.47) and 17.34 (s.d. = 5.78) at 21 weeks, with a significant adjusted mean change difference of -3.99 (95% CI -6.10 to -1.87). Patients in the UP-TAU group showed significant superiority in anxiety and clinical global impressions. The improvement in the UP-TAU group was maintained in all outcomes at 43 weeks. No serious adverse events were observed in the UP-TAU group. Conclusions The UP is an effective approach for patients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

One targetable mechanism through which polygenic variation may impact on individuals and interact with the social environment is stress sensitization, characterized by elevated reactivity to minor stressors in daily life. The current study aimed to investigate whether stress reactivity is modified by polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS) in cases with enduring non-affective psychotic disorder, first-degree relatives of cases, and controls. Methods We used the experience sampling method to assess minor stressors, negative affect, positive affect and psychotic experiences in 96 cases, 79 first-degree relatives, i.e. siblings, and 73 controls at wave 3 of the Dutch Genetic Risk and Outcome of Psychosis (GROUP) study. Genome-wide data were collected at baseline to calculate PRS. Results We found that associations of momentary stress with psychotic experiences, but not with negative and positive affect, were modified by PRS and group (all pFWE<0.001). In contrast to our hypotheses, siblings with high PRS reported less intense psychotic experiences in response to momentary stress compared to siblings with low PRS. No differences in magnitude of these associations were observed in cases with high v. low level of PRS. By contrast, controls with high PRS showed more intense psychotic experiences in response to stress compared to those with low PRS. Conclusions This tentatively suggests that polygenic risk may operate in different ways than previously assumed and amplify reactivity to stress in unaffected individuals but operate as a resilience factor in relatives by attenuating their stress reactivity.

However, the genetic overlap, causal relationships, and underlining mechanisms between PTSD and GIT disorders were absent. Methods We obtained genome-wide association study statistics for PTSD (23 212 cases, 151 447 controls), peptic ulcer disease (PUD; 16 666 cases, 439 661 controls), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD; 54 854 cases, 401 473 controls), PUD and/or GORD and/or medications (PGM; 90 175 cases, 366 152 controls), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS; 28 518 cases, 426 803 controls), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; 7045 cases, 449 282 controls). We quantified genetic correlations, identified pleiotropic loci, and performed multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation, fast gene-based association analysis, transcriptome-wide association study analysis, and bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis. Results PTSD globally correlates with PUD (rg = 0.526, p = 9.355 × 10-7), GORD (rg = 0.398, p = 5.223 × 10-9), PGM (rg = 0.524, p = 1.251 × 10-15), and IBS (rg = 0.419, p = 8.825 × 10-6). Cross-trait meta-analyses identify seven genome-wide significant loci between PTSD and PGM (rs13107325, rs1632855, rs1800628, rs2188100, rs3129953, rs6973700, and rs73154693); three between PTSD and GORD (rs13107325, rs1632855, and rs3132450); one between PTSD and IBS/IBD (rs4937872 and rs114969413, respectively). Proximal pleiotropic genes are mainly enriched in immune response regulatory pathways, and in brain, digestive, and immune systems. Gene-level analyses identify five candidates: ABT1, BTN3A2, HIST1H3J, ZKSCAN4, and ZKSCAN8. We found significant causal effects of GORD, PGM, IBS, and IBD on PTSD. We observed no reverse causality of PTSD with GIT disorders, except for GORD. Conclusions PTSD and GIT disorders share common genetic architectures.

The aim of the study was to determine whether managed transition (MT) improves mental health outcomes of YP reaching the child/adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) boundary compared with usual care (UC). Methods A two-arm cluster-randomised trial (ISRCTN83240263 and NCT03013595) with clusters allocated 1:2 between MT and UC. Recruitment took place in 40 CAMHS (eight European countries) between October 2015 and December 2016. Eligible participants were CAMHS service users who were receiving treatment or had a diagnosed mental disorder, had an IQ © 70 and were within 1 year of reaching the SB. MT was a multi-component intervention that included CAMHS training, systematic identification of YP approaching SB, a structured assessment (Transition Readiness and Appropriateness Measure) and sharing of information between CAMHS and adult mental health services. The primary outcome was HoNOSCA (Health of the Nation Outcome Scale for Children and Adolescents) score 15-months post-entry to the trial. Results The mean difference in HoNOSCA scores between the MT and UC arms at 15 months was -1.11 points (95% confidence interval -2.07 to -0.14, p = 0.03). The cost of delivering the intervention was relatively modest (€17-€65 per service user). Conclusions MT led to improved mental health of YP after the SB but the magnitude of the effect was small. The intervention can be implemented at low cost and form part of planned and purposeful transitional care.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

We lack a mechanistic explanation for how such beliefs arise. Here, we test a hypothesis that in people with compulsivity, fear, and anxiety, learning a probabilistic mapping between actions and environmental states is compromised. Methods In Study 1 (n = 174), we designed a novel online task that isolated state transition learning from other facets of learning and planning. To determine whether this impairment is due to learning that is too fast or too slow, we estimated state transition learning rates by fitting computational models to two independent datasets, which tested learning in environments in which state transitions were either stable (Study 2: n = 1413) or changing (Study 3: n = 192). Results Study 1 established that individuals with higher levels of compulsivity are more likely to demonstrate an impairment in state transition learning. Preliminary evidence here linked this impairment to a common factor comprising compulsivity and fear. Studies 2 and 3 showed that compulsivity is associated with learning that is too fast when it should be slow (i.e. when state transition are stable) and too slow when it should be fast (i.e. when state transitions change). Conclusions Together, these findings indicate that compulsivity is associated with a dysregulation of state transition learning, wherein the rate of learning is not well adapted to the task environment. Thus, dysregulated state transition learning might provide a key target for therapeutic intervention in compulsivity.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Machine learning is a promising method for improving the accuracy of difficult-to-predict outcomes. We compared the accuracy of traditional and machine-learning approaches for predicting BED treatment outcomes. Methods Participants were 191 adults with BED in a randomized controlled trial testing 6-month behavioral and stepped-care treatments. Outcomes, determined by independent assessors, were binge-eating (% reduction, abstinence), eating-disorder psychopathology, and weight loss (% loss, © 5% loss). Predictors included treatment condition, demographic information, and baseline clinical characteristics. Traditional models were logistic/linear regressions. Machine-learning models were elastic net regressions and random forests. Predictive accuracy was indicated by the area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), root mean square error (RMSE), and R2. Confidence intervals were used to compare accuracy across models. Results Across outcomes, AUC ranged from very poor to fair (0.49-0.73) for logistic regressions, elastic nets, and random forests, with few significant differences across model types. RMSE was significantly lower for elastic nets and random forests v. linear regressions but R2 values were low (0.01-0.23). Conclusions Different analytic approaches revealed some predictors of key treatment outcomes, but accuracy was limited. Machine-learning models with unbiased resampling methods provided a minimal advantage over traditional models in predictive accuracy for treatment outcomes.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Little is known about these patients and their treatment including the temporal distribution of IT events and factors associated with subsequent utilization of IT. Hence, this study explores (1) utilization patterns of IT events, and (2) factors associated with subsequent utilization of IT in patients with AN. Methods In this nationwide Danish register-based retrospective exploratory cohort study patients were identified from their first (index) hospital admission with an AN diagnosis and followed up for 5 years. We explored data on IT events including estimated yearly and total 5-year rates, and factors associated with subsequent increased IT rates and restraint, using regression analyses and descriptive statistics. Results IT utilization peaked in the initial few years starting at or following the index admission. A small percentage (1.0%) of patients accounted for 67% of all IT events. The most frequent measures reported were mechanical and physical restraint. Factors associated with subsequent increased IT utilization were female sex, lower age, previous admissions with psychiatric disorders before index admission, and IT related to those admissions. Factors associated with subsequent restraint were lower age, previous admissions with psychiatric disorders, and IT related to these. Conclusions High IT utilization in a small percentage of individuals with AN is concerning and can lead to adverse treatment experiences.

However, little research has examined the role of genetics in the expression of underlying phenotypes. We investigated whether the anorexia nervosa (AN), OCD, or AN/OCD transdiagnostic polygenic scores (PGS) predict eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety symptoms in a large developmental cohort in a sex-specific manner. Methods Using summary statistics from Psychiatric Genomics Consortium AN and OCD genome-wide association studies, we conducted an AN/OCD transdiagnostic genome-wide association meta-analysis. We then calculated AN, OCD, and AN/OCD PGS in participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children to predict eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety symptoms, stratified by sex (combined N = 3212-5369 per phenotype). Results The PGS prediction of eating disorder, OCD, and anxiety phenotypes differed between sexes, although effect sizes were small. AN and AN/OCD PGS played a more prominent role in predicting eating disorder and anxiety risk than OCD PGS, especially in girls. AN/OCD PGS provided a small boost over AN PGS in the prediction of some anxiety symptoms. All three PGS predicted higher compulsive exercise across different developmental timepoints [β = 0.03 (s.e. = 0.01) for AN and AN/OCD PGS at age 14; β = 0.05 (s.e. = 0.02) for OCD PGS at age 16] in girls. Conclusions Compulsive exercise may have a transdiagnostic genetic etiology, and AN genetic risk may play a role in the presence of anxiety symptoms. Converging with prior twin literature, our results also suggest that some of the contribution of genetic risk may be sex-specific.  © The Author(s), 2022.

FP is a feature of sensorimotor disruption in psychosis, hypnagogic experiences, solo pursuits and spiritual encounters, but research comparing these phenomena remains rare. A comparative approach to the phenomenology of FP has the potential to identify shared and unique processes underlying the experience across these contexts, with implications for clinical understanding and intervention. Methods We present a mixed-methods analysis from three online surveys comparing FP across three diverse contexts: a population sample which included people with experience of psychosis and voice-hearing (study 1, N = 75), people with spiritual and spiritualist beliefs (study 2, N = 47) and practitioners of endurance/solo pursuits (study 3, N = 84). Participants were asked to provide descriptions of their FP experiences and completed questionnaires on FP frequency, hallucinatory experiences, dissociation, paranoia, social inner speech and sleep. Data and code for the study are available via OSF. Results Hierarchical linear regression analysis indicated that FP frequency was predicted by a general tendency to experience hallucinations in all three studies, although paranoia and gender (female > male) were also significant predictors in sample 1. Qualitative analysis highlighted shared and diverging phenomenology of FP experiences across the three studies, including a role for immersive states in FP. Conclusions These data combine to provide the first picture of the potential shared mechanisms underlying different accounts of FP, supporting a unitary model of the experience.

The aim of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) on cognition in individuals with methamphetamine use disorder (MUD). Methods This was a secondary analysis of 40 MUD subjects receiving left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) iTBS or sham iTBS for 20 times over 10 days (twice-daily). Changes in working memory (WM) accuracy, reaction time, and sensitivity index were analyzed before and after active and sham rTMS treatment. Resting-state EEG was also acquired to identify potential biological changes that may relate to any cognitive improvement. Results The results showed that iTBS increased WM accuracy and discrimination ability, and improved reaction time relative to sham iTBS. iTBS also reduced resting-state delta power over the left prefrontal region. This reduction in resting-state delta power correlated with the changes in WM. Conclusions Prefrontal iTBS may enhance WM performance in MUD subjects. iTBS induced resting EEG changes raising the possibility that such findings may represent a biological target of iTBS treatment response.

Methods Sixty-two male MMT patients and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) underwent brain resting-state functional MRI data acquisition. The patients received 26-month follow-up for the monthly illegal-drug-use information. Ten addiction-related hubs were chosen to construct a user-defined network for the patients. Then the networks were discriminated with K-means-clustering-algorithm into different groups and followed by comparative analysis to the groups and HC. Regression analysis was used to investigate the brain regions significantly contributed to relapse. Results Sixty MMT patients were classified into two groups according to their brain-network patterns calculated by the best clustering-number-K. The two groups had no difference in the demographic, psychological indicators and clinical information except relapse rate and total heroin consumption. The group with high-relapse had a wider range of DC changes in the cortical-striatal-thalamic circuit relative to HC and a reduced DC in the mesocorticolimbic circuit relative to the low-relapse group. DC activity in NAc, vACC, hippocampus and amygdala were closely related with relapse. Conclusion MMT patients can be identified and classified into two subgroups with significantly different relapse rates by defining distinct brain-network patterns even if we are blind to their relapse outcomes in advance. This may provide a new strategy to optimize MMT. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

However, there has been little prospective research testing this question directly and it remains unclear whether smaller HV confers risk or is a consequence of traumatization and PTSD. Methods U.S. soldiers (N = 107) completed a battery of clinical assessments, including structural magnetic resonance imaging pre-deployment. Once deployed they completed monthly assessments of traumatic-stressors and symptoms. We hypothesized that smaller HV would potentiate the effects of traumatic stressors on PTSD symptoms in theater. Analyses evaluated whether total HV, lateral (right v. left) HV, or HV asymmetry (right - left) moderated the effects of stressor-exposure during deployment on PTSD symptoms. Results Findings revealed no interaction between total HV and average monthly traumatic-stressors on PTSD symptoms b = -0.028, p = 0.681 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.167 to 0.100]. However, in the context of greater exposure to average monthly traumatic stressors, greater right HV was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms b = -0.467, p = 0.023 (95% CI -0.786 to -0.013), whereas greater left HV was unexpectedly associated with greater PTSD symptoms b = 0.435, p = 0.024 (95% CI 0.028-0.715). Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of considering the complex role of HV, in particular HV asymmetry, in predicting the emergence of PTSD symptoms in response to war-zone trauma.

However, previous investigations have not explored infancy and early childhood development. It remains unclear whether such deficits emerge much earlier in life, and whether they are associated with psychotic, specifically hallucinatory, experiences (HE). Methods This study included data from Gen2 participants of The Raine Study (n = 1101), a population-based longitudinal cohort study in Western Australia. Five areas of childhood development comprising: communication; fine motor; gross motor; adaptive (problem-solving); and personal-social skills, were assessed serially at ages 1, 2 and 3 years. Information on HE, depression and anxiety at ages 10, 14 and 17 years was obtained. HE were further subdivided into those with transient or recurrent experiences. Mixed effects logistic regression models and cumulative risk analyses based on multiple domain delays were performed. Results Early poorer development in multiple areas was noted from ages 1, 2 and 3 years among youth who reported HE. Early developmental delays significantly increased the risk for later HE. This association was particularly marked in the recurrent HE group, with over 40% having early developmental delays in multiple domains. There was no significant association between early childhood development and later anxiety/depression apart from lower gross motor scores at age 3. Conclusions The findings suggest that early pan-developmental deficits are associated with later HE, with the effect strongest for young people who report recurrent HE throughout childhood and adolescence.

We sought to examine the relationship between neighbourhood-level marginalisation, social capital, and the incidence of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in Toronto, Canada. Methods We used a retrospective population-based cohort to identify incident cases of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder over a 10 year period and accounted for neighbourhood-level marginalisation and a proxy indicator of neighbourhood social capital. Mixed Poisson regression models were used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs). Results In the cohort (n = 649 020) we identified 4841 incident cases of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. A 27% variation in incidence was observed between neighbourhoods. All marginalisation dimensions, other than ethnic concentration, were associated with incidence. Compared to areas with low social capital, areas with intermediate social capital in the second [aIRR = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.33] and third (aIRR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.08-1.40) quintiles had elevated incidence rates after accounting for marginalisation. There was a higher risk associated with the intermediate levels of social capital (aIRR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.39) when analysed in only the females in the cohort, but the CI includes the possibility of a null effect. Conclusions The risk of developing schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in Toronto varies by neighbourhood and is associated with socioenvironmental exposures. Social capital was not linearly associated with risk, and risk differs by sex and social capital quintile. Future research should examine these relationships with different forms of social capital and examine how known individual-level risk factors impact these findings. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods A cohort study of 679 881 mothers (1 172 191 pregnancies) was conducted using Danish population register data-linkage. Hospital treatment for self-harm during pregnancy and the postnatal period (12 months after live delivery) were primary outcomes. Prevalence rates 1997-2015, in women with and without psychiatric history, were calculated. Cox regression was used to identify risk factors. Results Prevalence rates of self-harm were, in pregnancy, 32.2 (95% CI 28.9-35.4)/100 000 deliveries and, postnatally, 63.3 (95% CI 58.8-67.9)/100 000 deliveries. Prevalence rates of perinatal self-harm in women without a psychiatric history remained stable but declined among women with a psychiatric history. Risk factors for perinatal self-harm: younger age, non-Danish birth, prior self-harm, psychiatric history and parental psychiatric history. Additional risk factors for postnatal self-harm: multiparity and preterm birth. Of psychiatric conditions, personality disorder was most strongly associated with pregnancy self-harm (aHR 3.15, 95% CI 1.68-5.89); psychosis was most strongly associated with postnatal self-harm (aHR 6.36, 95% CI 4.30-9.41). For psychiatric disorders, aHRs were higher postnatally, particularly for psychotic and mood disorders. Conclusions Perinatal self-harm is more common in women with pre-existing psychiatric history and declined between 1997 and 2015, although not among women without pre-existing history. Our results suggest it may be a consequence of adversity and psychopathology, so preventative intervention research should consider both social and psychological determinants among women with and without psychiatric history.

Methods Using a population representative sample of 5088 adults aged •50 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we investigated relationships of polygenic predisposition to general cognition with a rate of change in cognition during a 10-year follow-up period. Polygenic predisposition was measured with polygenic scores for general cognition (GC-PGS). Cognition was measured employing tests for verbal memory and semantic fluency. Results The average baseline memory score was 11.1 (s.d. = 2.9) and executive function score was 21.5 (s.d. = 5.8). An increase in GC-PGS by one standard deviation (1-s.d.) was associated with a higher baseline verbal memory by an average 0.27 points (95% CI 0.19-0.34, p < 0.001). Similarly, 1-s.d. increase in GC-PGS was associated with a higher semantic fluency score at baseline in the entire sample (β = 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.64, p < 0.001). These associations were significant for women and men, and all age groups. Nonetheless, 1-s.d. increase in GC-PGS was not associated with decreases in verbal memory nor semantic fluency during follow-up in the entire sample, as well stratified models by sex and age. Conclusion Although common genetic variants associated with general cognition additively are associated with a stable surplus to cognition in adults, a polygenic predisposition to general cognition is not associated with age-related cognitive decline during a 10-year follow-up.  © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods Data were from a nationally representative cohort based on electronic health records from January 2013 to February 2021 (N = 852 233), with an interrupted time series study design. For the primary analysis, the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on incident suicide attempts warranting in-patient hospital treatment was quantified by fitting a Poisson regression and modeling the relative risk (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Scenarios were forecast to predict attempted suicide rates at 10 months after social mitigation strategies. Fourteen sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results Despite the increasing trend in the unexposed interval, the interval exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic was statistically significant (p < 0.001) associated with a reduced RR of incident attempted suicide (RR = 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.78). Consistent with the primary analysis, sensitivity analysis of sociodemographic groups and methodological factors were statistically significant (p < 0.05). No effect modification was identified for COVID-19 lockdown intervals or COVID-19 illness status. All three forecast scenarios at 10 months projected a suicide attempt rate increase from 12.49 (7.42-21.01) to 21.38 (12.71-35.99). Conclusions The interval exposed to the protracted mass social trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a lower suicide attempt rate compared to the unexposed interval. However, this trend is likely to reverse 10 months after lifting social mitigation policies, underscoring the need for enhanced implementation of public health policy for suicide prevention.

Two basic types of dynamic effects are possible. The 'Risk Escalation hypothesis' posits that worsening of risk levels predicts DD onset above average level of risk factors. Alternatively, the 'Chronic Risk hypothesis' posits that the average level rather than change predicts first-onset DD. Methods We utilized data from the ADEPT project, a cohort of 496 girls (baseline age 13.5-15.5 years) from the community followed for 3 years. Participants underwent five waves of assessments for risk factors and diagnostic interviews for DD. For illustration purposes, we selected 16 well-established dynamic risk factors for adolescent depression, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms, personality traits, clinical traits, and social risk factors. We conducted Cox regression analyses with time-varying covariates to predict first DD onset. Results Consistently elevated risk factors (i.e. the mean of multiple waves), but not recent escalation, predicted first-onset DD, consistent with the Chronic Risk hypothesis. This hypothesis was supported across all 16 risk factors. Conclusions Across a range of risk factors, girls who had first-onset DD generally did not experience a sharp increase in risk level shortly before the onset of disorder; rather, for years before onset, they exhibited elevated levels of risk. Our findings suggest that chronicity of risk should be a particular focus in screening high-risk populations to prevent the onset of DDs. In particular, regular monitoring of risk factors in school settings is highly informative.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Here, we investigated the eCB system of women with and without CM and their infants using hair samples representing eCB levels accumulated during the last trimester of pregnancy and 10-12 months postpartum. Methods CM exposure was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. At both timepoints, 3 cm hair strands were collected from mothers and children (N = 170 resp. 150) to measure anandamide (AEA), 2/1-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG/1-AG), stearoylethanolamide (SEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA). Results Maternal hair levels of 2-AG/1-AG increased and SEA levels decreased from late pregnancy to one year postpartum. Maternal CM was associated with lower SEA levels in late pregnancy, but not one year later. In the children's hair, levels of 2-AG/1-AG increased while levels of SEA, OEA, and PEA decreased from late pregnancy to one year later. Maternal CM was not consistently associated with the eCB levels measured in children's hair. Conclusions We provide first evidence for longitudinal change in the eCB system of mothers and infants from pregnancy to one year later. While maternal CM influenced the maternal eCB system, we found no consistent intergenerational effects on early regulation of the eCB system in children.

We aimed to identify whether IQ-derived cognitive subtypes are present in early-phase schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and examine their relationship with brain structure and markers of neuroinflammation. Method 161 patients with recent-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorder (<5 years) were recruited. Estimated premorbid and current IQ were calculated using the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading and a 4-subtest WAIS-III. Cognitive subtypes were identified with k-means clustering. Freesurfer was used to analyse 3.0 T MRI. Blood samples were analysed for hs-CRP, IL-1RA, IL-6 and TNF-α. Results Three subtypes were identified indicating preserved (PIQ), deteriorated (DIQ) and compromised (CIQ) IQ. Absolute total brain volume was significantly smaller in CIQ compared to PIQ and DIQ, and intracranial volume was smaller in CIQ than PIQ (F(2, 124) = 6.407, p = 0.002) indicative of premorbid smaller brain size in the CIQ group. CIQ had higher levels of hs-CRP than PIQ (F(2, 131) = 5.01, p = 0.008). PIQ showed differentially impaired processing speed and verbal learning compared to IQ-matched healthy controls. Conclusions The findings add validity of a neurodevelopmental subtype of schizophrenia identified by comparing estimated premorbid and current IQ and characterised by smaller premorbid brain volume and higher measures of low-grade inflammation (CRP).  © The Author(s), 2022.

It can be conceptualized as an interconnected system of psychotic and affective experiences; a so-called 'symptom network'. Differences in demographics, as well as exposure to adversities and risk factors, may produce substantial heterogeneity in symptom networks, highlighting potential etiological divergence in psychosis risk. Methods To explore this idea in a data-driven way, we employed a novel recursive partitioning approach in the 2007 English National Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity (N = 7242). We sought to identify 'network phenotypes' by explaining heterogeneity in symptom networks through potential moderators, including age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, childhood abuse, separation from parents, bullying, domestic violence, cannabis use, and alcohol. Results Sex was the primary source of heterogeneity in symptom networks. Additional heterogeneity was explained by interpersonal trauma (childhood abuse and domestic violence) in women and domestic violence, cannabis use, ethnicity in men. Among women, especially those exposed to early interpersonal trauma, an affective loading within psychosis may have distinct relevance. Men, particularly those from minority ethnic groups, demonstrated a strong network connection between hallucinatory experiences and persecutory ideation. Conclusion Symptom networks of psychosis expression in the general population are highly heterogeneous. The structure of symptom networks seems to reflect distinct sex-related adversities, etiologies, and mechanisms of symptom-expression. Disentangling the complex interplay of sex, minority ethnic group status, and other risk factors may help optimize early intervention and prevention strategies in psychosis.

This randomized controlled study evaluated the efficacy of one such intervention program called Resilience Training (RT). Methods College students who reported mildly elevated depressive or subclinical psychotic symptoms ('psychotic experiences' (PEs)) (n = 107) were randomized to receiving RT (n = 54) or to a waitlist control condition (n = 53). RT consists of a four-session intervention focused on improving resilience through the acquisition of mindfulness, self-compassion, and mentalization skills. Measures of symptoms and these resilience-enhancing skills were collected before and after the 4-week RT/waitlist period, with a follow-up assessment 12-months later. Results Compared to the waitlist control group, RT participants reported significantly greater reductions in PEs, distress associated with PEs, depression, and anxiety, as well as significantly greater improvements in resilience, mindfulness, self-compassion, and positive affect, following the 4-week RT/waitlist period (all p < 0.03). Moreover, improvements in resilience-promoting skills were significantly correlated with symptom reductions (all p < 0.05). Lastly, the RT-related reductions in PEs and associated distress were maintained at the 12-month follow-up assessment. Conclusions RT is a brief, group-based intervention associated with improved resilience and reduced symptoms of psychopathology, with sustained effects on PEs, in transdiagnostically at-risk young adults. Follow-up studies can further assess the efficacy of RT relative to other interventions and test whether it can reduce the likelihood of developing a serious mental illness.

However, it is not known why only some exposed individuals go on to develop psychosis. One possibility is pre-existing polygenic vulnerability. Here, we investigated, in the largest sample of first-episode psychosis (FEP) cases to date, whether childhood adversity and high polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia (SZ-PRS) combine synergistically to increase the risk of psychosis, over and above the effect of each alone. Methods We assigned a schizophrenia-polygenic risk score (SZ-PRS), calculated from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC2), to all participants in a sample of 384 FEP patients and 690 controls from the case-control component of the EU-GEI study. Only participants of European ancestry were included in the study. A history of childhood adversity was collected using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Synergistic effects were estimated using the interaction contrast ratio (ICR) [odds ratio (OR)exposure and PRS - ORexposure - ORPRS + 1] with adjustment for potential confounders. Results There was some evidence that the combined effect of childhood adversities and polygenic risk was greater than the sum of each alone, as indicated by an ICR greater than zero [i.e. ICR 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.29 to 3.85]. Examining subtypes of childhood adversities, the strongest synergetic effect was observed for physical abuse (ICR 6.25, 95% CI -6.25 to 20.88). Conclusions Our findings suggest possible synergistic effects of genetic liability and childhood adversity experiences in the onset of FEP, but larger samples are needed to increase precision of estimates.

Methods Family genetic risk scores (FGRS) for MD, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol use disorder, DUD, ADHD, and autism-spectrum disorder were calculated from 1st-5th degree relatives in the Swedish population born 1932-1995 (n = 5 829 952). Profiles of these FGRS were obtained and compared across various subgroups of DUD, MD, and ADHD cases. Results Differences in FGRS profiles for DUD, MD, and ADHD by sex were modest, but they varied substantially by AAO, recurrence, ascertainment, and treatment with scores typically higher in cases with greater severity (e.g. early AAO, high recurrence, ascertainment in high intensity clinical settings, and treatment). However, severity was not always related to purer genetic profiles, as genetic risk for many disorders often increased together. However, some results, such as by mode of ascertainment from different Swedish registries, produced qualitative differences in FGRS profiles. Conclusions Differences in FGRS profiles for DUD, MD, and ADHD varied substantially by AAO, recurrence, ascertainment, and treatment. Replication of psychiatric studies, particularly those examining genetic factors, may be difficult unless cases are matched not only by diagnosis but by important clinical characteristics. Genetic correlations between psychiatric disorders could arise through one disorder impacting on the patterns of ascertainment for the other, rather than from the direct effects of shared genetic liabilities.

Methods We derived data from interviews with 85-year-olds in 1986-1987 (N = 348), 2008-2010 (N = 433) and 2015-17 (N = 321). Depression diagnoses were made according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Symptom burden was assessed with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Information on psychotropic drug use, sociodemographic, and health-related factors were collected during the interviews. Results The prevalence of major depression was lower in 2015-2017 (4.7%, p < 0.001) and 2008-2010 (6.9%, p = 0.010) compared to 1986-1987 (12.4%). The prevalence of minor depression was lower in 2015-2017 (8.1%) compared to 2008-2010 (16.2%, p = 0.001) and 1986-1987 (17.8%, p < 0.001). Mean MADRS score decreased from 8.0 in 1986-1987 to 6.5 in 2008-2010, and 5.1 in 2015-2017 (p < 0.001). The reduced prevalence of depression was not explained by changes in sociodemographic and health-related risk factors for depression. While psychoactive drug use was observed in a third of the participants in each cohort, drug type changed over time (increased use of antidepressants and decreased use of anxiolytics and antipsychotics). Conclusions The prevalence of depression in octogenarians has declined during the past decades. The decline was not explained by changes in known risk factors for depression. The present study cannot answer whether changed prescription patterns of psychoactive drugs have contributed to the decline. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

This study evaluated the modulators of wellbeing in individuals with lifetime recurrent MDD (RMDD), single-episode MDD (SMDD) and no MDD in the UK Biobank. Methods Scores of happiness, meaningful life and satisfaction about functioning were condensed in a functioning-wellbeing score (FWS). We evaluated depression and anxiety characteristics, neuroticism-related traits, physical diseases, lifestyle and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) of psychiatric disorders. Other than individual predictors, we estimated the cumulative contribution to FWS of each group of predictors. We tested the indirect role of neuroticism on FWS through the modulation of depression manifestations using a mediation analysis. Results We identified 47 966, 21 117 and 207 423 individuals with lifetime RMDD, SMDD and no MDD, respectively. Depression symptoms and personality showed the largest impact on FWS (variance explained ~20%), particularly self-harm, worthlessness feelings during the worst depression, chronic depression, loneliness and neuroticism. Personality played a stronger role in SMDD. Anxiety characteristics showed a higher effect in SMDD and no MDD groups. Neuroticism played indirect effects through specific depressive symptoms that modulated FWS. Physical diseases and lifestyle explained only 4-5% of FWS variance. The PRS of MDD showed the largest effect on FWS compared to other PRSs. Conclusions This was the first study to comprehensively evaluate the predictors of wellbeing in relation to the history of MDD. The identified variables are important to identify individuals at risk and promote wellbeing.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

There is evidence for aberrant emotional cognition in unaffected relatives of patients with these mood disorders, but studies are conflicting. We aimed to investigate whether emotional cognition in unaffected first-degree relatives of patients with mood disorders is characterised by heterogeneity using a data-driven approach. Methods Data from 94 unaffected relatives (33 of MDD patients; 61 of BD patients) and 203 healthy controls were pooled from two cohort studies. Emotional cognition was assessed with the Social Scenarios Test, Facial Expression Recognition Test and Faces Dot-Probe Test. Hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted using emotional cognition data from the 94 unaffected relatives. The resulting emotional cognition clusters and controls were compared for emotional and non-emotional cognition, demographic characteristics and functioning. Results Two distinct clusters of unaffected relatives were identified: a relatively 'emotionally preserved' cluster (55%; 40% relatives of MDD probands) and an 'emotionally blunted' cluster (45%; 29% relatives of MDD probands). 'Emotionally blunted' relatives presented with poorer neurocognitive performance (global cognition p = 0.010), heightened subsyndromal mania symptoms (p = 0.004), lower years of education (p = 0.004) and difficulties with interpersonal functioning (p = 0.005) than controls, whereas 'emotionally preserved' relatives were comparable to controls on these measures. Conclusions Our findings show discrete emotional cognition profiles that occur across healthy first-degree relatives of patients with MDD and BD. These emotional cognition clusters may provide insight into emotional cognitive markers of genetically distinct subgroups of individuals at familial risk of mood disorders.

Methods From Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, this study identified adolescents aged 10-19 years who died from suicide (n = 935) between 1 January 2000, and 31 December 2016, by linking each patient with the national mortality database. The researchers conducted a nested case-control study through risk set sampling, and for each case, 20 age- and sex-matched controls (n = 18 700) were selected from the general population. The researchers applied conditional logistic regression to investigate differences in medical utilization and physical and psychiatric comorbidities between cases and controls. Results Cases had a higher proportion of contact with the psychiatric department but a similar proportion of contact with any non-psychiatric medical department within 1 year before suicide compared with controls. There were 18.6% of adolescent suicide victims who only had contacted with a psychiatric department 3 months before suicide. Moreover, cases had a higher proportion of contact with non-psychiatric services within 3 months before suicide, particularly with emergency, surgery, and internal medicine departments. Cases had higher risks of several psychiatric disorders and physical illnesses, including heart diseases, pneumonia, and ulcer disease, than did controls. Conclusions The findings of increased medical utilization and higher risks of physical and psychiatric comorbidities in adolescent suicide victims are crucial for developing specific interventions to prevent suicide in this population.

However, since these biobanks originate from patient populations, there is a possibility of bias in polygenic risk estimation due to overrepresentation of patients with higher frequency of healthcare interactions. Methods PRS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression were calculated using summary statistics from the largest available genomic studies for a sample of 24 153 European ancestry participants in the Mass General Brigham (MGB) Biobank. To correct for selection bias, we fitted logistic regression models with inverse probability (IP) weights, which were estimated using 1839 sociodemographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization features extracted from electronic health records of 1 546 440 non-Hispanic White patients eligible to participate in the Biobank study at their first visit to the MGB-affiliated hospitals. Results Case prevalence of bipolar disorder among participants in the top decile of bipolar disorder PRS was 10.0% (95% CI 8.8-11.2%) in the unweighted analysis but only 6.2% (5.0-7.5%) when selection bias was accounted for using IP weights. Similarly, case prevalence of depression among those in the top decile of depression PRS was reduced from 33.5% (31.7-35.4%) to 28.9% (25.8-31.9%) after IP weighting. Conclusions Non-random selection of participants into volunteer biobanks may induce clinically relevant selection bias that could impact implementation of PRS in research and clinical settings. As efforts to integrate PRS in medical practice expand, recognition and mitigation of these biases should be considered and may need to be optimized in a context-specific manner.  © The Author(s), 2023.

We sought (i) to compare EI in patients after a FEM, chronic BD and healthy controls (HC); (ii) to examine the effect exerted on EI by socio-demographic, clinical and neurocognitive variables in FEM patients. Methods The Emotional Intelligence Quotient (EIQ) was calculated with the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). Performance on MSCEIT was compared among the three groups using generalized linear models. In patients after a FEM, the influence of socio-demographic, clinical and neurocognitive variables on the EIQ was examined using a linear regression model. Results In total, 184 subjects were included (FEM n = 48, euthymic chronic BD type I n = 75, HC n = 61). BD patients performed significantly worse than HC on the EIQ [mean difference (MD) = 10.09, standard error (s.e.) = 3.14, p = 0.004] and on the understanding emotions branch (MD = 7.46, s.e. = 2.53, p = 0.010). FEM patients did not differ from HC and BD on other measures of MSCEIT. In patients after a FEM, EIQ was positively associated with female sex (β = -0.293, p = 0.034) and verbal memory performance (β = 0.374, p = 0.008). FEM patients performed worse than HC but better than BD on few neurocognitive domains. Conclusions Patients after a FEM showed preserved EI, while patients in later stages of BD presented lower EIQ, suggesting that impairments in EI might result from the burden of disease and neurocognitive decline, associated with the chronicity of the illness.

It follows that identification of treatment-resistant aberrant neural processes in MDD may inform clinical and research efforts targeting sustained remission. Thus, we sought to identify brain regions showing aberrant neural functioning in MDD that either (1) fail to exhibit substantive change (nonresponse) or (2) exhibit functional changes (response) following CBT. Methods To identify treatment-resistant neural processes (as well as neural processes exhibiting change after treatment), we collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of MDD patients (n = 58) before and after CBT as well as never-depressed controls (n = 35) before and after a similar amount of time. We evaluated fMRI data using conjunction analyses, which utilized several contrast-based criteria to characterize brain regions showing both differences between patients and controls at baseline and nonresponse or response to CBT. Results Findings revealed nonresponse in a cerebellar region and response in prefrontal and parietal regions. Conclusions Results are consistent with prior theoretical models of CBT's direct effect on cortical regulatory processes but expand on them with identification of additional regions (and associated neural systems) of response and nonresponse to CBT.

However, no studies have analyzed the dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) of hippocampal subregions in melancholic MDD. We aimed to reveal the patterns for dFC variability in hippocampus subregions - including the bilateral rostral and caudal areas and its associations with cognitive impairment in melancholic MDD. Methods Forty-two treatment-naive MDD patients with melancholic features and 55 demographically matched healthy controls were included. The sliding-window analysis was used to evaluate whole-brain dFC for each hippocampal subregions seed. We assessed between-group differences in the dFC variability values of each hippocampal subregion in the whole brain and cognitive performance on the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). Finally, association analysis was conducted to investigate their relationships. Results Patients with melancholic MDD showed decreased dFC variability between the left rostral hippocampus and left anterior lobe of cerebellum compared with healthy controls (voxel p < 0.005, cluster p < 0.0125, GRF corrected), and poorer cognitive scores in working memory, verbal learning, visual learning, and social cognition (all p < 0.05). Association analysis showed that working memory was positively correlated with the dFC variability values of the left rostral hippocampus-left anterior lobe of the cerebellum (r = 0.338, p = 0.029) in melancholic MDD. Conclusions These findings confirmed the distinct dynamic functional pathway of hippocampal subregions in patients with melancholic MDD, and suggested that the dysfunction of hippocampus-cerebellum connectivity may be underlying the neural substrate of working memory impairment in melancholic MDD.

Serum protein levels were detected using a multi-analyte platform (171 analytes, immunoassay, Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP 250+). Proteomic clusters were computed using weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). Results Six proteomic clusters were identified, of which one was nominally significantly associated with current MDD (p = 9.62E-03, Bonferroni adj. p = 0.057). This cluster contained 21 analytes and was enriched with pathways involved in inflammation and metabolism [including C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin and insulin]. At the individual symptom level, this proteomic cluster was associated with ten symptoms, among which were five atypical, energy-related symptoms. After correcting for several health and lifestyle covariates, hypersomnia, increased appetite, panic and weight gain remained significantly associated with the cluster. Conclusions Our findings support the idea that alterations in a network of proteins involved in inflammatory and metabolic processes are present in MDD, but these alterations map predominantly to clinical symptoms reflecting an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure.

We investigated treatment effects, in terms of total cumulative antipsychotic dose, efficacy and tolerability, on brain structural changes over the first 24 months of treatment in schizophrenia. Methods A prospective, 24-month, single-site cohort study in 99 minimally treated patients with first-episode schizophrenia, schizophreniform and schizoaffective disorder, and 98 matched healthy controls. We treated the patients according to a fixed protocol with flupenthixol decanoate, a long-acting injectable antipsychotic. We assessed psychopathology, cognition, extrapyramidal symptoms and BMI, and acquired MRI scans at months 0, 12 and 24. We selected global cortical thickness, white matter volume and basal ganglia volume as the regions of interest. Results The only significant group × time interaction was for basal ganglia volumes. However, patients, but not controls, displayed cortical thickness reductions and increases in white matter and basal ganglia volumes. Cortical thickness reductions were unrelated to treatment. White matter volume increases were associated with lower cumulative antipsychotic dose, greater improvements in psychopathology and cognition, and more extrapyramidal symptoms. Basal ganglia volume increases were associated with greater improvements in psychopathology, greater increases in BMI and more extrapyramidal symptoms. Conclusions We provide evidence for plasticity in white matter and basal ganglia associated with antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia, most likely linked to the dopamine blocking actions of these agents. Cortical changes may be more closely related to the neurodevelopmental, non-dopaminergic aspects of the illness.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

It is unknown whether SG deficit leads to poor neurocognitive, social, and/or real-world functioning. This study aimed to explore the longitudinal relationships between SG and these variables. Methods Seventy-nine EP patients and 88 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited at baseline. Thirty-three and 20 EP patients completed 12-month and 24-month follow-up, respectively. SG was measured using the auditory dual-click (S1 & S2) paradigm and quantified as P50 ratio (S2/S1) and difference (S1-S2). Cognition, real-life functioning, and symptoms were assessed using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery, Global Functioning: Social (GFS) and Role (GFR), Multnomah Community Ability Scale (MCAS), Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT), and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-square, mixed model, correlation and regression analyses were used for group comparisons and relationships among variables controlling for potential confounding variables. Results In EP patients, P50 ratio (p < 0.05) and difference (p < 0.001) at 24-month showed significant differences compared with that at baseline. At baseline, P50 indices (ratio, S1-S2 difference, S1) were independently associated with GFR in HCs (all p < 0.05); in EP patients, S2 amplitude was independently associated with GFS (p = 0.037). At 12-month and 24-month, P50 indices (ratio, S1, S2) was independently associated with MCAS (all p < 0.05). S1-S2 difference was a trending predictor of future function (GFS or MCAS). Conclusions SG showed progressive reduction in EP patients. P50 indices were related to real-life functioning. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Such a context may raise many concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic long-term psychological effects. An analysis of administrative databases could be an alternative and complementary approach to medical interview-based epidemiological surveys to monitor the mental health of the population. We conducted a nationwide study to describe the consumption of anxiolytics, antidepressants and hypnotics during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the five previous years. Methods A historic cohort study was conducted by extracting and analysing data from the French health insurance database between 1 January 2015 and 28 February 2021. Individuals were classified into five age-based classes. Linear regression models were performed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period on the number of drug consumers, in introducing an interaction term between time and COVID-19 period. Results Since March 2020, in all five age groups and all three drug categories studied, the number of patients reimbursed weekly has increased compared to the period from January 2015 to February 2020. The youngest the patients, the more pronounced the magnitude. Conclusions Monitoring the consumption of psychiatric medications could be of great interest as reliable indicators are essential for planning public health strategies. A post-crisis policy including reliable monitoring of mental health must be anticipated.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

In this study, we explored whether OCS severity impacted subjective wellbeing and general functioning, independently of depressive and psychotic symptoms. Methods We used anonymised electronic healthcare records from a large cohort of patients who were treated with clozapine and assessed annually for OCS, wellbeing, general functioning, and psychopathology using standardised scales as part of routine clinical practice. We used statistical mixed linear model techniques to evaluate the longitudinal influence of OCS severity on wellbeing and general functioning. Results A total of 184 patients were included, with 527 face-to-face assessments and 64.7% evaluated three or more times. Different linear mixed models demonstrated that OCS in patients treated with clozapine were associated with significantly worse wellbeing scores, independently of depression and psychotic symptoms, but OCS did not impair general functioning. Obsessional thinking and hoarding behaviour, but not compulsions, were significantly associated with the impact on wellbeing, which may be attributable to the ego-syntonic nature of the compulsions. Conclusions Given the frequent occurrence of OCS and their negative impact on wellbeing, we encourage clinicians to routinely assess and treat OCS in patients who are taking clozapine.

Researchers have proposed five theories: dispositional negative emotionality (neuroticism), impulsive responsivity to emotions (impulsivity), thought dysfunction, low cognitive functioning, and impairment. These theories have primarily been inferred from patterns of loadings of diagnoses on p-factors with different sets of diagnoses included in different studies. Researchers who have directly examined these theories of p have examined a subset of the theories in any single sample, limiting the ability to compare the size of their associations with a p-factor. Methods In a sample of adults (N = 1833, Mage = 34.20, 54.4% female, 53.3% white) who completed diagnostic assessments, self-report measures, and cognitive tests, we evaluated statistical p-factor structures across modeling approaches and compared the strength of associations among the p-factor and indicators of each of these five theories. Results We found consistent evidence of the p-factor's unidimensionality across one-factor and bifactor models. The p-factor was most strongly and similarly associated with neuroticism (r =.88), impairment (r =.88), and impulsivity (r =.87), χ2(1)s <.15, ps >.70, and less strongly associated with thought dysfunction (r =.78), χ2(1)s > 3.92, ps <.05, and cognitive functioning (r = -.25), χ2(1)s > 189.56, ps <.01. Conclusions We discuss a tripartite definition of p that involves the transaction of impulsive responses to frequent negative emotions leading to impairment that extends and synthesizes previous theories of psychopathology.

Intersex or differences of sex development (DSD) conditions have long been kept concealed and high levels of (internalizing) mental health problems are reported. This study examines the effects of condition openness on anxiety and depression and the role of mediating concepts in this population. Methods Cross-sectional data of individuals of 16 years and older with an intersex/DSD condition was collected in 14 specialized European clinics as part of the dsd-LIFE study. Patient-reported measures were taken on openness and shame (Coping with DSD), self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), satisfaction with care (CSQ4), anxiety and depression (HADS). Scores were compared per clinical group and data were analyzed via structural equation modeling (SEM) to calculate prediction and mediation models. Results Data of 903 individuals were included in this study (Turner syndrome (n = 284), 46, XY DSD (n = 233), CAH (n = 206) and Klinefelter syndrome (n = 180)). Participants were moderately open on their condition. High levels of both anxiety and depression were observed across the sample. In SEM analysis, the tested models predicted 25% of openness, 31% of anxiety and 48% of depression. More condition openness directly predicted lower anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as indirectly through increased self-esteem, self-satisfaction and satisfaction with social support. Conclusions Condition openness is associated with lower anxiety and depression in individuals with an intersex/DSD condition.

But its association with acylcarnitines remains unclear. The aim of this study was to assess metabolomic profiles of 38 acylcarnitines in patients with major depression before and after treatment compared to healthy controls (HCs). Methods Metabolomic profiles of 38 plasma short-, medium-, and long-chain acylcarnitines were performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 893 HCs from the VARIETE cohort and 460 depressed patients from the METADAP cohort before and after 6 months of antidepressant treatment. Results As compared to HCs, depressed patients had lower levels of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines. After 6 months of treatment, increased levels of medium- and long-chain acyl-carnitines were observed that no longer differed from those of controls. Accordingly, several medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines were negatively correlated with depression severity. Conclusions These medium- and long-chain acylcarnitine dysregulations argue for mitochondrial dysfunction through fatty acid β-oxidation impairment during major depression.  © The Author(s), 2023.

However, evidence is lacking with respect to how anger changes over a deployment cycle, and which factors prospectively influence change in anger among combat-deployed soldiers. Methods Reports of problematic anger were obtained from 7298 US Army soldiers who deployed to Afghanistan in 2012. A series of mixed-effects growth models estimated linear trajectories of anger over a period of 1-2 months before deployment to 9 months post-deployment, and evaluated the effects of pre-deployment factors (prior deployments and perceived resilience) on average levels and growth of problematic anger. Results A model with random intercepts and slopes provided the best fit, indicating heterogeneity in soldiers' levels and trajectories of anger. First-time deployers reported the lowest anger overall, but the most growth in anger over time. Soldiers with multiple prior deployments displayed the highest anger overall, which remained relatively stable over time. Higher pre-deployment resilience was associated with lower reports of anger, but its protective effect diminished over time. First- and second-time deployers reporting low resilience displayed different anger trajectories (stable v. decreasing, respectively). Conclusions Change in anger from pre- to post-deployment varies based on pre-deployment factors. The observed differences in anger trajectories suggest that efforts to detect and reduce problematic anger should be tailored for first-time v. repeat deployers. Ongoing screening is needed even for soldiers reporting high resilience before deployment, as the protective effect of pre-deployment resilience on anger erodes over time.

Understanding factors associated with psychosis development, such as sleep, could aid in identification of individuals at elevated risk. This study aimed to assess (1) the dynamic relationship between psychotic experiences (PEs) and sleep quality and quantity, and (2) whether this relationship differed between different clinical stages along the psychosis continuum. Methods: We used daily diary data (90 days) of individuals (N = 96) at early stages (i.e. before a first diagnosis of psychosis) along the psychosis continuum. Multilevel models were constructed with sleep quality and sleep quantity as predictors of PEs and vice versa. Post-hoc, we constructed a multilevel model with both sleep quality and quantity as predictors of PEs. In addition, we tested whether associations differed between clinical stages. Results: Within persons, poorer sleep predicted next day PEs (B = -0.02, p = 0.01), but not vice versa. Between persons, shorter sleep over the 90-day period predicted more PEs (B = -0.04, p = 0.002). Experiencing more PEs over 90-days predicted poorer (B = -0.02, p = 0.02) and shorter (B = -1.06, p = 0.008) sleep. We did not find any significant moderation effects for clinical stage. Conclusions: We found a bidirectional relationship between sleep and PEs with daily fluctuations in sleep predicting next day PEs and general patterns of more PEs predicting poorer and shorter sleep. Our results highlight the importance of assessing sleep as a risk marker in the early clinical stages for psychosis.  © The Author(s), 2023.

Here, we analyzed the predictive value of the professional support received, circumstances prior to discontinuation, a strategy of discontinuation, and use of functional and non-functional coping strategies during discontinuation on self-reported discontinuation success and on objective discontinuation. Methods Patients who had attempted discontinuing antipsychotics (AP) and/or antidepressants (AD) during the past 5 years (n = 316) completed an online survey including questions on subjective and objective discontinuation success, sociodemographic, clinical and medication-related factors, and scales to assess the putative predictors. Results A regression model with all significant predictors explained 20-30% of the variance in discontinuation success for AD and 30-40% for AP. After controlling for baseline sociodemographic, clinical and medication-related factors, the most consistent predictor of subjective discontinuation success was self-care behavior, in particular mindfulness, relaxation and making use of supportive relationships. Other predictors depended on the type of medication: For AD, good alliance with the prescribing physician predicted higher subjective success whereas gradual tapering per se was associated with lower subjective success and a lower chance of full discontinuation. In those tapering off AP, leaving time to adjust between dose reductions was associated with higher subjective success and fewer negative effects. Conclusions The findings can inform evidence-based clinical guidelines and interventions aiming to support patients during discontinuation. Further studies powered to take interactions between variables into account are needed to improve the prediction of successful discontinuation.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

The objectives of this study were to examine the sex-specific associations between prenatal maternal stress and child internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and to assess the moderating effects of parenting behaviors on these associations. Methods This study is based on 15 963 mother-child dyads from the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). A broad measure of prenatal maternal stress was constructed using 41 self-reported items measured during pregnancy. Three parenting behaviors (positive parenting, inconsistent discipline, and positive involvement) were assessed by maternal report at child age 5 years. Child symptoms of internalizing and externalizing disorders (depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and oppositional-defiant disorder) were assessed by maternal report at age 8. Analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling techniques. Results Prenatal maternal stress was associated with child internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 8; associations with externalizing symptoms differed by sex. Associations between prenatal maternal stress and child depression, and conduct disorder and oppositional-defiant disorder in males, became stronger as levels of inconsistent discipline increased. Associations between prenatal maternal stress and symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in females were attenuated as levels of parental involvement increased. Conclusions This study confirms associations between prenatal maternal stress and children's mental health outcomes, and demonstrates that these associations may be modified by parenting behaviors. Parenting may represent an important intervention target for improving mental health outcomes in children exposed to prenatal stress.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

This study aims to investigate these distinguishing factors further within an ideation-to-action framework and to explore sex differences in suicide risk. Methods Participants (n = 7546, aged 16+) were from the cross-sectional Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS; 2014) of England. Face-to-face and self-completion questionnaires assessed lifetime suicidal ideation, lifetime suicide attempts, demographic characteristics, life experiences, social support, health and mental illness. Multinomial logistic regression examined factors differentiating between those with suicidal ideation only and suicide attempt histories (with or without suicidal ideation) in men and women. Results Overall men were less likely to report suicidal thoughts and attempts, compared to females. More factors differentiated between suicidal thoughts and attempts in women compared to in men; these included hospital admission for mental illness, below degree level qualifications, being single and childhood adversity. In men, factors which significantly differentiated between suicidal thoughts and attempts included self-report of professional diagnosis of mental illness and childhood adversity. Higher levels of social support were associated with being in the suicidal thoughts group v. in the attempts group in men. Conclusion This study identified some key differences between men and women in factors associated with suicide attempts compared to suicidal thoughts. The findings support the use of the ideation-to-action framework to investigate sex differences in suicidal behaviour. Future research should examine the extent to which these factors are associated with suicide risk over time.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

However, it is not known if there is heterogeneity in these alterations beyond what might be expected due to normal individual differences, indicative of subgroups of patients at greater vulnerability to metabolic dysregulation. Methods We employed meta-analysis of variance, indexed using the coefficient of variation ratio (CVR), to compare variability of the following metabolic parameters in antipsychotic naïve FEP and controls: fasting glucose, glucose post-oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting insulin, insulin resistance, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides. Standardised mean difference in metabolic parameters between groups was also calculated; meta-regression analyses examined physiological/demographic/psychopathological moderators of metabolic change. Results Twenty-eight studies were analysed (1716 patients, 1893 controls). Variability of fasting glucose [CVR = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.55; p = 0.001], glucose post-OGTT (CVR = 1.43; 95% CI 1.10-1.87; p = 0.008), fasting insulin (CVR = 1.31; 95% CI 1.09-1.58; p = 0.01), insulin resistance (CVR = 1.34; 95% CI 1.12-1.60; p = 0.001), HbA1c (CVR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.06-1.27; p < 0.0001), total-cholesterol (CVR = 1.15; 95% CI 1.01-1.31; p = 0.03), LDL-cholesterol (CVR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.09-1.50; p = 0.002), and HDL-cholesterol (CVR = 1.15; 95% CI 1.00-1.31; p < 0.05), but not triglycerides, was greater in patients than controls. Mean glucose, glucose post-OGTT, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, and triglycerides were greater in patients; mean total-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were reduced in patients. Increased symptom severity and female sex were associated with worse metabolic outcomes. Conclusions Patients with FEP present with greater variability in metabolic parameters relative to controls, consistent with a subgroup of patients with more severe metabolic changes compared to others. Understanding determinants of metabolic variability could help identify patients at-risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Female sex and severe psychopathology are associated with poorer metabolic outcomes, with implications for metabolic monitoring in clinical practice.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This was a population-based, case-control, sibling study examining familial clustering of all psychiatric disorders and low IQ, using data from the Israel Draft-Board Registry on all Jewish adolescents assessed between 1998 and 2014. Methods We identified all cases with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, N = 2128), severe intellectual disability (ID, N = 9572), attention-deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) (N = 3272), psychotic (N = 7902), mood (N = 9704), anxiety (N = 10 606), personality (N = 24 816), or substance/alcohol abuse (N = 791) disorders, and low IQ ( © 2 SDs below the population mean, N = 31 186). Non-CNS control disorders were adolescents with Type-1 diabetes (N = 2427), hernia (N = 29 558) or hematological malignancies (N = 931). Each case was matched with 10 age-matched controls selected at random from the Draft-Board Registry, with replacement, and for each case and matched controls, we ascertained all full siblings. The main outcome measure was the relative recurrence risk (RRR) of the sibling of a case having the same (within-disorder RRR) or a different (across-disorder RRR) disorder. Results Within-disorder RRRs were increased for all diagnostic categories, ranging from 11.53 [95% confidence interval (CI): 9.23-14.40] for ASD to 2.93 (95% CI: 2.80-3.07) for personality disorders. The median across-disorder RRR between any pair of psychiatric disorders was 2.16 (95% CI: 1.45-2.43); the median RRR between low IQ and any psychiatric disorder was 1.37 (95% CI: 0.93-1.98). There was no consistent increase in across-disorder RRRs between the non-CNS disorders and psychiatric disorders and/or low IQ. Conclusion These large population-based study findings suggest shared etiologies among most psychiatric disorders, and low IQ.  Copyright © Sheba Medical Center, 2021.

We aimed to establish whether health outcomes and care differed between patients infected with COVID-19 with BD and patients without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. Methods We conducted a population-based cohort study of all patients with identified COVID-19 and respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized in France between February and June 2020. The outcomes were in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding factors. Results In total, 50 407 patients were included, of whom 480 were patients with BD. Patients with BD were 2 years older, more frequently women and had more comorbidities than controls without a diagnosis of severe mental illness. Patients with BD had an increased in-hospital mortality rate (26.6% v. 21.9%; p = 0.034) and similar ICU admission rate (27.9% v. 28.4%, p = 0.799), as confirmed by propensity analysis [odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (OR, 95% CI) for mortality: 1.30 (1.16-1.45), p < 0.0001]. Significant interactions between BD and age and between BD and social deprivation were found, highlighting that the most important inequalities in mortality were observed in the youngest [OR, 95% CI 2.28 (1.18-4.41), p = 0.0015] and most deprived patients with BD [OR, 95% CI 1.60 (1.33-1.92), p < 0.001]. Conclusions COVID-19 patients with BD were at an increased risk of mortality, which was exacerbated in the youngest and most deprived patients with BD. Patients with BD should thus be targeted as a high-risk population for severe forms of COVID-19, requiring enhanced preventive and disease management strategies.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

The aim of this study was to examine the association between the first identifiable symptom and the subsequent speed of illness progression. Methods Data were available for 390 patients attending a catchment-based early intervention service for FEP. Exposure to non-psychotic and subthreshold psychotic symptoms was retrospectively recorded using semi-structured interviews. Outcomes following the onset of the first identifiable symptom were (1) time to onset of FEP and (2) symptom incidence rate (i.e. number of symptoms emerging per person-year until FEP onset). These outcomes were respectively analyzed with Cox proportional hazards and negative binomial regressions. Results After Bonferroni correction, having a subthreshold psychotic (v. non-psychotic) symptom as the first symptom was not associated with time to FEP onset [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.39; 95% CI 0.94-2.04] but was associated with higher symptom incidence [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.92; 95% CI 1.10-3.48]. A first symptom of suspiciousness was associated with shorter time to FEP onset (HR = 2.37; 95% CI 1.38-4.08) and higher symptom incidence rate (IRR = 3.20; 95% CI 1.55-7.28) compared to other first symptoms. In contrast, a first symptom of self-harm was associated with lower symptom incidence rate (IRR = 0.06; 95% CI 0.01-0.73) compared to other first symptoms. Several associations between symptoms and illness progression were moderated by the age at symptom onset.

Dynamical systems theory has proposed that rises in certain 'early warning signals' (EWSs) in time-series data (e.g. auto-correlation, temporal variance, network connectivity) may precede impending changes in disorder severity. The current study investigates whether rises in these EWSs over time are associated with future changes in disorder severity among a group of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods Thirty-one patients with MDD completed the study, which consisted of daily smartphone-delivered surveys over 8 weeks. Daily positive and negative affect were collected for the time-series analyses. A rolling window approach was used to determine whether rises in auto-correlation of total affect, temporal standard deviation of total affect, and overall network connectivity in individual affect items were predictive of increases in depression symptoms. Results Results suggested that rises in auto-correlation were significantly associated with worsening in depression symptoms (r = 0.41, p = 0.02). Results indicated that neither rises in temporal standard deviation (r = -0.23, p = 0.23) nor in network connectivity (r = -0.12, p = 0.59) were associated with changes in depression symptoms. Conclusions This study more rigorously examines whether rises in EWSs were associated with future depression symptoms in a larger group of patients with MDD. Results indicated that rises in auto-correlation were the only EWS that was associated with worsening future changes in depression.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Smartphone-based treatment is a low-cost, convenient alternative modality. This study evaluated a self-help smartphone-based CBT-I in alleviating major depression and insomnia. Methods A parallel-group randomized, waitlist-controlled trial was conducted with 320 adults with major depression and insomnia. Participants were randomized to receive either a 6-week CBT-I via a smartphone application, proACT-S, or waitlist condition. The primary outcomes included depression severity, insomnia severity, and sleep quality. The secondary outcomes included anxiety severity, subjective health, and acceptability of treatment. Assessments were administered at baseline, post-intervention (week 6) follow-up, and week 12 follow-up. The waitlist group received treatment after the week 6 follow-up. Results Intention to treat analysis was conducted with multilevel modeling. In all but one model, the interaction between treatment condition and time at week 6 follow-up was significant. Compared with the waitlist group, the treatment group had lower levels of depression [Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D): Cohen's d = 0.86, 95% CI (-10.11 to -5.37)], insomnia [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): Cohen's d = 1.00, 95% CI (-5.93 to -3.53)], and anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - Anxiety subscale (HADS-A): Cohen's d = 0.83, 95% CI (-3.75 to -1.96)]. They also had better sleep quality [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): Cohen's d = 0.91, 95% CI (-3.34 to -1.83)]. No differences across any measures were found at week 12, after the waitlist control group received the treatment.

In order to explore the relationship between these common symptoms, we performed a detailed clinical assessment of motor, non-motor symptoms, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disability in a large cohort of patients with motor FND. To understand the clinical heterogeneity, cluster analysis was used to search for subgroups within the cohort. Methods One hundred fifty-two patients with a clinically established diagnosis of motor FND were assessed for motor symptom severity using the Simplified Functional Movement Disorder Rating Scale (S-FMDRS), the number of different motor phenotypes (i.e. tremor, dystonia, gait disorder, myoclonus, and weakness), gait severity and postural instability. All patients then evaluated each motor symptom type severity on a Likert scale and completed questionnaires for depression, anxiety, pain, fatigue, cognitive complaints and HRQoL. Results Significant correlations were found among the self-reported and all objective motor symptoms severity measures. All self-reported measures including HRQoL correlated strongly with each other. S-FMDRS weakly correlated with HRQoL. Hierarchical cluster analysis supplemented with gap statistics revealed a homogenous patient sample which could not be separated into subgroups. Conclusions We interpret the lack of evidence of clusters along with a high degree of correlation between all self-reported and objective measures of motor or non-motor symptoms and HRQoL within current neurobiological models as evidence to support a unified pathophysiology of 'functional' symptoms. Our results support the unification of functional and somatic syndromes in classification schemes and for future mechanistic and therapeutic research.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

This study aimed to identify cognitive subgroups in a large sample of FEP using a clustering approach with healthy controls as a reference group, subsequently linking cognitive subgroups to clinical and functional outcomes. Methods 204 FEP patients were included. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using baseline brief assessment of cognition in schizophrenia (BACS). Cognitive subgroups were compared to 40 controls and linked to longitudinal clinical and functional outcomes (PANSS, GAF, self-reported WHODAS 2.0) up to 12-month follow-up. Results Three distinct cognitive clusters emerged: relative to controls, we found one cluster with preserved cognition (n = 76), one moderately impaired cluster (n = 74) and one severely impaired cluster (n = 54). Patients with severely impaired cognition had more severe clinical symptoms at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-up as compared to patients with preserved cognition. General functioning (GAF) in the severely impaired cluster was significantly lower than in those with preserved cognition at baseline and showed trend-level effects at 6- and 12-month follow-up. No significant differences in self-reported functional outcome (WHODAS 2.0) were present. Conclusions Current results demonstrate the existence of three distinct cognitive subgroups, corresponding with clinical outcome at baseline, 6- and 12-month follow-up. Importantly, the cognitively preserved subgroup was larger than the severely impaired group. Early identification of discrete cognitive profiles can offer valuable information about the clinical outcome but may not be relevant in predicting self-reported functional outcomes.

This study examined change in impulsivity during cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacological treatment for BED and associations with treatment outcomes. Methods In total, 108 patients with BED (NFEMALE = 84) in a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of CBT and/or fluoxetine were assessed before treatment, monthly throughout treatment, at post-treatment (16 weeks), and at 12-month follow-up after completing treatment. Patients completed established measures of impulsivity, eating-disorder psychopathology, and depression, and were measured for height and weight [to calculate body mass index (BMI)] during repeated assessments by trained/monitored doctoral research-clinicians. Mixed-effects models using all available data examined changes in impulsivity and the association of rapid and overall changes in impulsivity on treatment outcomes. Exploratory analyses examined whether baseline impulsivity predicted/moderated outcomes. Results Impulsivity declined significantly throughout treatment and follow-up across treatment groups. Rapid change in impulsivity and overall change in impulsivity during treatment were significantly associated with reductions in eating-disorder psychopathology, depression scores, and BMI during treatment and at post-treatment. Overall change in impulsivity during treatment was associated with subsequent reductions in depression scores at 12-month follow-up. Baseline impulsivity did not moderate/predict eating-disorder outcomes or BMI but did predict change in depression scores. Conclusions Rapid and overall reductions in impulsivity during treatment were associated with improvements in specific eating-disorder psychopathology and associated general outcomes. These effects were found for both CBT and pharmacological treatment for BED. Change in impulsivity may be an important process prospectively related to treatment outcome.

In the decades since, dozens of papers have confirmed and extended these early results, convincingly demonstrating that disadvantaged neighborhood contexts predict elevated rates of both internalizing and externalizing disorders across childhood and adolescence. It is unclear, however, how neighborhood disadvantage increases psychopathology. Methods Our study sought to fill this gap in the literature by examining the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a composite measure of Census tract disadvantage, as an etiologic moderator of several common forms of psychopathology in two samples of school-aged twins from the Michigan State University Twin Registry (N = 4815 and 1030 twin pairs, respectively), the latter of which was enriched for neighborhood disadvantage. Results Across both samples, genetic influences on attention-deficit hyperactivity problems were accentuated in the presence of marked disadvantage, while nonshared environmental contributions to callous-unemotional traits increased with increasing disadvantage. However, neighborhood disadvantage had little moderating effect on the etiology of depression, anxiety, or somatic symptoms. Conclusions Such findings suggest that, although neighborhood disadvantage does appear to serve as a general etiologic moderator of many (but not all) forms of psychopathology, this etiologic moderation is phenotype-specific.  © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods In the native Swedish population, born 1960-1980 and followed through 2017 (n = 1 862 435), the family genetic risk score (FGRS) for AUD and DUD and GAEA were calculated from, respectively, the educational attainment and risk for AUD and DUD, of 1st through 5th degree relatives from Swedish national registers. Analyses utilized Aalen's linear hazards models. Results Risk for AUD was robustly predicted by the main effects of FGRSAUD [b = 6.32 (95% CI 6.21-6.43), z = 64.9, p < 0.001) and GAEA [b = -2.90 (2.83-2.97), z = 44.1, p < 0.001] and their interaction [b = -1.93 (1.83-2.03), z = 32.9, p < 0.001]. Results were similar for the prediction of DUD by the main effects of FGRSDUD [b = 4.65 (CI 4.56-4.74), z = 59.4, p < 0.001] and GAEA [-2.08 (2.03-2.13), z = 46.4, p < 0.001] and their interaction [b = -1.58 (1.50-1.66)), z = 30.2, p < 0.001]. The magnitude of the interactions between GAEA and FGRSAUD and FGRSDUD in the prediction of, respectively, AUD and DUD was attenuated only slightly by the addition of educational attainment to the model. Conclusions and relevance The genetic propensity to high educational attainment robustly moderates the genetic risk for both AUD and DUD such that the impact of the genetic liability to AUD and DUD on the risk of illness is substantially attenuated in those with high v. low GAEA. This effect is not appreciably mediated by the actual level of educational attainment. These naturalistic findings could form the basis of prevention efforts in high-risk youth.

Methods We examined whether the relationship between polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS-Sz) and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), as measured by the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences-42 (CAPE-42) questionnaire, is mediated or moderated by lifetime cannabis use at 16 years of age in 1740 of the individuals of the European IMAGEN cohort. Secondary analysis examined the relationships between lifetime cannabis use, PRS-Sz and the various sub-scales of the CAPE-42. Sensitivity analyses including covariates, including a PRS for cannabis use, were conducted and results were replicated using data from 1223 individuals in the Dutch Utrecht cannabis cohort. Results PRS-Sz significantly predicted cannabis use (p = 0.027) and PLE (p = 0.004) in the IMAGEN cohort. In the full model, considering PRS-Sz and covariates, cannabis use was also significantly associated with PLE in IMAGEN (p = 0.007). Results remained consistent in the Utrecht cohort and through sensitivity analyses. Nevertheless, there was no evidence of a mediation or moderation effects. Conclusions These results suggest that cannabis use remains a risk factor for PLEs, over and above genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia. This research does not support the notion that the cannabis-psychosis link is limited to individuals who are genetically predisposed to psychosis and suggests a need for research focusing on cannabis-related processes in psychosis that cannot be explained by genetic vulnerability.

Previous studies highlight a relationship between poor self-regulation and onset of eating pathology. In this study, we investigated whether this association is mediated by decision-making difficulties. Methods To test this hypothesis, we used data from the Millennium Cohort Study. Decision-making performance was assessed with the Cambridge Gambling Task at age 11. Principal components analysis was used to derive an index of ED symptoms at age 14. The trajectories of scores of two subscales of the Child Social Behaviour Questionnaire, Independence and Self-Regulation (ISR) and Emotional Dysregulation (EmotDy), were modelled from ages 3 to 7 years in a latent growth curve analysis. The individual predicted values of the intercept (set at baseline, 3 years) and the slope (rate of annual change) were then used in the mediation analysis. Results In our sample of 11 303 individuals, there was evidence for mediation by three measures of decision-making at age 11 (poor quality of decision-making, delay aversion and low risk-adjustment) in the association between EmotDy across ages 3-7 and ED symptoms at age 14 even after the adjustment for relevant covariates. We found no evidence of association between ISR and ED symptoms. Conclusion Our findings suggest that emotion regulation processes during childhood may be relevant for the future onset of ED symptoms via their association with decision-making skills. These findings, obtained from a large, representative, sample, shed light on the relationship between self-regulation, decision-making and symptoms of EDs. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Results PRSs for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, alcohol dependence, sensitivity to environmental stress and adversity, educational attainment, cognitive performance, and IQ were associated with suicidal behavior (Bonferroni-corrected p < 2.5 × 10-4). The polygenic effects of all 22 psychiatric disorders/traits had the same direction (p for binomial tests = 4.8 × 10-7) and were correlated (Spearman's ρ = 0.85) between non-fatal suicide attempters and suicide decedents. Conclusions We found that polygenic effects for major psychiatric disorders and diathesis-related traits including stress responsiveness and intellect/cognitive function contributed to suicidal behavior. While we found comparable polygenic architecture between non-fatal suicide attempters and suicide decedents based on correlations with PRSs of suicide-related psychiatric disorders/traits, our analyses are limited by small sample size resulting in low statistical power to detect difference between non-fatal suicide attempt and suicide death.

Methods A nationally representative sample of 14057 veterans completed a cross-sectional survey. To examine associations of exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs; witnessing, perpetrating, and betrayal) and suicidal self-directed violence, we estimated two series of multivariable logistic regressions stratified by gender, with peri- and post-military suicide attempt as the dependent variables. Results PMIE exposure accounted for additional risk of suicide attempt during and after military service after controlling for demographic and military characteristics, current mental health status, and pre-military history of suicidal ideation and attempt. Men who endorsed PMIE exposure by perpetration were 50% more likely to attempt suicide during service and twice as likely to attempt suicide after separating from service. Men who endorsed betrayal were nearly twice as likely to attempt suicide during service; however, this association attenuated to non-significance after separation in the fully adjusted models. In contrast, women who endorsed betrayal were over 50% more likely to attempt suicide during service and after separation; PMIE exposure by perpetration did not significantly predict suicide attempts before or after service among women in the fully adjusted models. Conclusions Our findings indicate that suicide assessment and prevention programs should consider the impact of moral injury and attend to gender differences in this risk factor in order to provide the most comprehensive care.

In this study of suicidal adolescent inpatients, theoretically informed risk factors were assessed daily following discharge to predict near-term suicidal ideation and inform decision algorithms for identifying elevations in daily level risk, with implications for real-time suicide-focused interventions. Methods Adolescents (N = 78; 67.9% female) completed brief surveys texted daily for 4 weeks after discharge (n = 1621 observations). Using multi-level classification and regression trees (CARTSs) with repeated 5-fold cross-validation, we tested (a) a simple prediction model incorporating previous-day scores for each of 10 risk factors, and (b) a more complex model incorporating, for each of these factors, a time-varying person-specific mean over prior days together with deviation from that mean. Models also incorporated missingness and contextual (study week, day of the week) indicators. The outcome was the presence/absence of next-day suicidal ideation. Results The best-performing model (cross-validated AUC = 0.86) was a complex model that included ideation duration, hopelessness, burdensomeness, and self-efficacy to refrain from suicidal action. An equivalent model that excluded ideation duration had acceptable overall performance (cross-validated AUC = 0.78). Models incorporating only previous-day scores, with and without ideation duration (cross-validated AUC of 0.82 and 0.75, respectively), showed relatively weaker performance. Conclusions Results suggest that specific combinations of dynamic risk factors assessed in adolescents' daily life have promising utility in predicting next-day suicidal thoughts. Findings represent an important step in the development of decision tools identifying short-term risk as well as guiding timely interventions sensitive to proximal elevations in suicide risk in daily life.

We examined the effect of the pandemic on the risk of depression in older adults. Methods We analyzed data from the prospective cohort study of Korean older adults, which has been followed every 2 years. Among the 2308 participants who completed both the third and the fourth follow-up assessments, 58.4% completed their fourth follow-up before the outbreak of COVID-19 and the rest completed it during the pandemic. We conducted face-to-face diagnostic interviews using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and used Geriatric Depression Scale. We performed generalized estimating equations and logistic regression analyses. Results The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased depressive symptoms in older adults [b (standard error) = 0.42 (0.20), p = 0.040] and a doubling of the risk for incident depressive disorder even in euthymic older adults without a history of depression (odds ratio = 2.44, 95% confidence interval 1.18-5.02, p = 0.016). Less social activities, which was associated with the risk of depressive disorder before the pandemic, was not associated with the risk of depressive disorder during the pandemic. However, less family gatherings, which was not associated with the risk of depressive disorder before the pandemic, was associated with the doubled risk of depressive disorder during the pandemic. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic significantly influences the risk of late-life depression in the community. Older adults with a lack of family gatherings may be particularly vulnerable.

We conducted a cross-cultural survey using demographically representative samples from the UK (n = 1533), USA (n = 1550) and Turkey (n = 1567). The most effective incentives in all three countries were vaccination of an expert scientist, followed by vaccination of friends and family members and knowing someone dying from the disease. Vaccination of an expert scientist was significantly more effective at increasing vaccine intention than any other incentive. Vaccine incentives, regardless of the incentive type, were much less effective for those who originally refused the COVID-19 vaccine than for those who were hesitant to receive the vaccine. Although the percentage of vaccine-hesitant participants was highest in Turkey, the mean effectiveness scores of incentives were also the highest in Turkey, suggesting that an informed vaccine promotion strategy can be successful in this country. Our findings have policy applicability and suggest that positive vaccination messages delivered by expert scientists, vaccination of friends and family and risk-based incentives can be effective at increasing vaccine uptake.

However, little is known about their spectrum of psychopathology in adulthood. Methods We investigated the psychiatric phenotypes of adult CNV carriers and compared probands, who were ascertained through clinical genetics services, with carriers who were not. One hundred twenty-four adult participants (age 18-76), each bearing one of 15 rare CNVs, were recruited through a variety of sources including clinical genetics services, charities for carriers of genetic variants, and online advertising. A battery of psychiatric assessments was used to determine psychopathology. Results The frequencies of psychopathology were consistently higher for the CNV group compared to general population rates. We found particularly high rates of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) (48%), mood disorders (42%), anxiety disorders (47%) and personality disorders (73%) as well as high rates of psychiatric multimorbidity (median number of diagnoses: 2 in non-probands, 3 in probands). NDDs [odds ratio (OR) = 4.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-16.51; p = 0.017) and psychotic disorders (OR = 6.8, 95% CI 1.3-36.3; p = 0.025) occurred significantly more frequently in probands (N = 45; NDD: 39[87%]; psychosis: 8[18%]) than non-probands (N = 79; NDD: 20 [25%]; psychosis: 3[4%]). Participants also had somatic diagnoses pertaining to all organ systems, particularly conotruncal cardiac malformations (in individuals with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome specifically), musculoskeletal, immunological, and endocrine diseases. Conclusions Adult CNV carriers had a markedly increased rate of anxiety and personality disorders not previously reported and high rates of psychiatric multimorbidity.

A recent Mendelian Randomisation (MR) study suggested that CRP may decrease and IL-6 may increase anxiety and depression symptoms. Methods Among 68 769 participants of the population-based Trondelag Health Study (HUNT), we performed cross-sectional observational and one-sample MR analyses of serum CRP and two-sample MR analysis of serum IL-6. The main outcomes were symptoms of anxiety and depression assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and life satisfaction assessed using a seven-level ordinal questionnaire where higher scores indicate lower life satisfaction. Results In cross-sectional observational analyses, a doubling in serum CRP level was associated with 0.27% (95% CI -0.20 to 0.75) difference in HADS depression score (HADS-D), -0.77% (95% CI -1.24 to -0.29) difference in HADS anxiety score (HADS-A) and -0.10% (95% CI -0.41 to 0.21) difference in life satisfaction score. In one-sample MR analyses, a doubling in serum CRP was associated with 2.43% (95% CI -0.11 to 5.03) higher HADS-D, 1.94% (95% CI -0.58 to 4.52) higher HADS-A, and 2.00% (95% CI 0.45 to 3.59) higher life satisfaction score. For IL-6, causal point estimates were in the opposite direction, but imprecise and far from conventional criteria for statistical significance. Conclusions Our results do not support a major causal role of serum CRP on anxiety and depression symptoms and life satisfaction, but provides weak evidence that serum CRP may modestly increase anxiety and depression symptoms and reduce life satisfaction.

However, due to response delay and cognitive impairment, ECT remains an imperfect treatment. Compared to ECT, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is less effective at treating severe depression, but has the advantage of being quick, easy to use, and producing almost no side effects. In this study, our objective was to assess the priming effect of rTMS sessions before ECT on clinical response in patients with TRD. Methods In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial, 56 patients with TRD were assigned to active or sham rTMS before ECT treatment. Five sessions of active/sham neuronavigated rTMS were administered over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (20 Hz, 90% resting motor threshold, 20 2 s trains with 60-s intervals, 800 pulses/session) before ECT (which was active for all patients) started. Any relative improvements were then compared between both groups after five ECT sessions, in order to assess the early response to treatment. Results After ECT, the active rTMS group exhibited a significantly greater relative improvement than the sham group [43.4% (28.6%) v. 25.4% (17.2%)]. The responder rate in the active group was at least three times higher. Cognitive complaints, which were assessed using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, were higher in the sham rTMS group compared to the active rTMS group, but this difference was not corroborated by cognitive tests. Conclusions rTMS could be used to enhance the efficacy of ECT in patients with TRD. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02830399.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

No prior published study has examined, using a controlled study design, a broad set of hypothesized WS for suicide attempt. This study addressed this gap through examination of hypothesized behavioral/experiential, cognitive, and affective WS among patients recently hospitalized following a suicide attempt. Methods Participants were recruited during hospitalization from five medical centers across the USA including two civilian hospitals and three Veterans Health Administration facilities (n = 349). A within-person case-crossover study design was used, where each patient served as her/his own control. WS were measured by the Timeline Follow-back for Suicide Attempts Interview and were operationalized as factors that were present (v. absent) or that increased in frequency/intensity within an individual during the 6 h preceding the suicide attempt (case period) compared to the corresponding 6 h on the day before (control period). Results Select WS were associated with near-term risk for suicide attempt including suicide-related communications, preparing personal affairs, drinking alcohol, experiencing a negative interpersonal event, and increases in key affective (e.g. emptiness) and cognitive (e.g. burdensomeness) responses. Conclusions The identification of WS for suicidal behavior can enhance risk recognition efforts by medical providers, patients, their families, and other stakeholders that can serve to inform acute risk management decisions.

Conclusions The findings reveal the irony that porn - a male-dominated industry that targets a male-dominated audience - is associated with the erosion of the quality of men's sex lives and the improvement of women's sex lives.  © The Author(s), 2022.

We propose that individual differences early in the attentional processing of threats are associated with these neurobiological mechanisms and contribute to mental illness in this population. Methods We assessed attentional bias in relation to threat (AB) in women survivors of IPV (n = 69) and controls (n = 36), and examined overall cortisol secretion using hair cortisol (HC), and stress responsiveness measuring salivary cortisol and α-amylase (sAA) before (T0), and after (T1, T2) an acute psychosocial stress task (Trier Social Stress Test). We used repeated-measures ANCOVAs to explore the associations between Group (IPV, control) and AB with acute stress response, and regression models to examine the associations with mental health symptoms. Results There were no between-group differences in HC levels. An interaction between Group and AB was found regarding cortisol reactivity (p < 0.05). IPV women with threat avoidance AB showed a blunted cortisol response compared to controls and to IPV participants with threat vigilance AB. The association between sAA reactivity and the interaction between Group, AB, and time approached significance (p = 0.07), with a trend to lower sAA levels particularly in IPV women with threat avoidance AB. Group and cortisol reactivity were associated with symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (8-20% explained variance). Conclusions Threat avoidance AB is associated with blunted acute cortisol response among women exposed to chronic stress (IPV). Experiencing IPV and acute cortisol response appear to be clearly implicated in long-term mental health problems.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Parental severe mental illness can pose a challenge to the home environment of a child. We aimed to examine the home environment of children of parents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and controls longitudinally through at-home assessments. Methods Assessments were conducted within The Danish High Risk and Resilience Study, a nationwide multi-center cohort study of children of parents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and population-based controls. The level of at-home stimulation and support was measured at age 7 (N = 508 children) and age 11 (N = 430 children) with the semi-structured HOME Inventory. Results from the 11-year follow-up study were analyzed and compared with 7-year baseline results to examine change across groups. Results At age 11, children of parents with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder had lower levels of stimulation and support than controls (mean (s.d.) = 46.16 (5.56), 46.87 (5.34) and 49.25 (4.37) respectively, p < 0.001). A higher proportion of children with parental schizophrenia or bipolar disorder lived in inadequate home environments at age 11, compared with controls (N (%) = 24 (15.0), 12 (12.2) and 6 (3.5) respectively, p < 0.003). The changes in home environment scores did not differ across groups from age 7 to age 11. Conclusions Assessed longitudinally from the children's age of 7 to 11, children of parents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder had lower levels of stimulation and support in their homes than controls. Integrated support which can target practical, economic, social and health issues to improve the home environment is indicated. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods In the present study, we examined 79 patients (57 males; age range = 17-70 years, M ± s.d. = 38 ± 16.13; BDI-II, M ± s.d. = 9.84 ± 8.67) with TBI. We used structural MRI and resting-state fMRI to examine whether there was a relationship between depression, as measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the voxel-based morphology or functional connectivity in regions previously identified as involved in emotional regulation in patients following TBI. Patients were at least 4 months post-TBI (M ± s.d. = 15.13 ± 11.67 months) and the severity of the injury included mild to severe cases [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), M ± s.d. = 6.87 ± 3.31]. Results Our results showed that BDI-II scores were unrelated to voxel-based morphology in the examined regions. We found a positive association between depression scores and rs-fc between limbic regions and cognitive control regions. Conversely, there was a negative association between depression scores and rs-fc between limbic and frontal regions involved in emotion regulation. Conclusion These findings lead to a better understanding of the exact mechanisms that contribute to depression following TBI and better inform treatment decisions. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Modern molecular genetic approaches to this problem are limited by a reliance on case-control designs. Methods - In 5 828 760 individuals born in Sweden from 1932-1995 with a mean (s.d.) age at follow-up of 54.4 (18.1), we examined family genetic risk score (FGRS) profiles including internalizing, psychotic, substance use and developmental disorders in 10 pairs of psychiatric and substance use disorders diagnosed from population registries. We examined these profiles in three groups of patients: disorder A only, disorder B only and comorbid cases with both disorders. Results - The most common pattern of findings, seen in five pairings, was simple and quantitative. Comorbid cases had higher FGRS than both non-comorbid cases for all (or nearly all) disorders. However, the pattern was more complex in the remaining five pairings and included qualitative changes where the comorbid cases showed no increases in FGRS for certain disorders and in a few cases significant decreases. Several comparisons showed an asymmetric pattern of findings with increases, in comorbidity compared to single disorder cases, of the FGRS for only one of the two disorders. Conclusions - The examination of FGRS profiles in general population samples where all disorders are assessed in all subjects provides a fruitful line of inquiry to understand the origins of psychiatric comorbidity. Further work will be needed, with an expansion of analytic approaches, to gain deeper insights into the complex mechanisms likely involved. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

This study undertook the first comparison of two machine learning (ML) approaches [penalised logistic regression (LASSO), and prediction rule ensembles (PREs)] to conventional logistic regression (LR) models to enhance prediction of ED onset and differential ED diagnoses from a range of putative risk factors. Method Data were part of a European Project and comprised 1402 participants, 642 ED patients [52% with anorexia nervosa (AN) and 40% with bulimia nervosa (BN)] and 760 controls. The Cross-Cultural Risk Factor Questionnaire, which assesses retrospectively a range of sociocultural and psychological ED risk factors occurring before the age of 12 years (46 predictors in total), was used. Results All three statistical approaches had satisfactory model accuracy, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 86% for predicting ED onset and 70% for predicting AN v. BN. Predictive performance was greatest for the two regression methods (LR and LASSO), although the PRE technique relied on fewer predictors with comparable accuracy. The individual risk factors differed depending on the outcome classification (EDs v. non-EDs and AN v. BN). Conclusions Even though the conventional LR performed comparably to the ML approaches in terms of predictive accuracy, the ML methods produced more parsimonious predictive models. ML approaches offer a viable way to modify screening practices for ED risk that balance accuracy against participant burden.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Prior research has linked antisociality to autonomic nervous system and endocrinological functioning. However, there is large heterogeneity in antisocial behaviors, and these neurobiological measures are rarely studied conjointly, limited to small specific studies with narrow age ranges, and yield mixed findings due to the type of behavior examined. Methods We harmonized data from 1489 participants (9-27 years, 67% male), from six heterogeneous samples. In the resulting dataset, we tested relations between distinct dimensions of antisociality and heart rate, pre-ejection period (PEP), respiratory sinus arrhythmia, respiration rate, skin conductance levels, testosterone, basal cortisol, and the cortisol awakening response (CAR), and test the role of age throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Results Three dimensions of antisociality were uncovered: 'callous-unemotional (CU)/manipulative traits', 'intentional aggression/conduct', and 'reactivity/impulsivity/irritability'. Shorter PEPs and higher testosterone were related to CU/manipulative traits, and a higher CAR is related to both CU/manipulative traits and intentional aggression/conduct. These effects were stable across age. Conclusions Across a heterogeneous sample and consistent across development, the CAR may be a valuable measure to link to CU/manipulative traits and intentional aggression, while sympathetic arousal and testosterone are additionally valuable to understand CU/manipulative traits. Together, these findings deepen our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying different components of antisociality. Finally, we illustrate the potential of using current statistical techniques for combining multiple datasets to draw robust conclusions about biobehavioral associations.

Phenomenological links between trauma and voices support this hypothesis, as they suggest post-traumatic processes contribute to the content of, and relationships with, voices. However, research has included small samples and lacked theory-based comprehensive assessments. Method In people with distressing voices (n = 73) who experienced trauma prior to voice-hearing, trauma-voice links were assessed both independently and dependently (descriptions were presented and rated separately and together, respectively) by both participants and researchers. A structured coding frame assessed four types of independent links (i.e. victimisation type, physiological-behavioural, emotional, and cognitive response themes including negative self-beliefs) and three types of dependent links: relational (similar interaction with/response to, voice and trauma); content (voice and trauma content are exactly the same); and identity (voice identity is the same as perpetrator). Results Independent links were prevalent in participants (51-58%) and low to moderately present in researcher ratings (8-41%) for significant themes. Identification of negative self-beliefs in trauma was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of negative self-beliefs in voices [participants odds ratio (OR) 9.8; researchers OR 4.9]. Participants and researchers also reported many dependent links (80%, 66%, respectively), most frequently relational links (75%, 64%), followed by content (60%, 25%) and identity links (51%, 22%). Conclusion Trauma appears to be a strong shaping force for voice content and its psychological impact. The most common trauma-voice links involved the experience of cognitive-affective psychological threat, embodied in relational experiences. Trauma-induced mechanisms may be important intervention targets.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

These deficits allegedly stem from impairments in functionally corresponding brain areas. Increasingly, studies suggest that some performance deficits are in part caused by negative task-taking attitudes such as poor motivation or the presence of distracting symptoms. A pilot study confirmed that these factors mediate neurocognitive deficits in depression. The validity of these results is however questionable given they were based solely on self-report measures. The present study addresses this caveat by having examiners assess influences during a neurocognitive examination, which were concurrently tested for their predictive value on performance. Methods Thirty-three patients with depression and 36 healthy controls were assessed on a battery of neurocognitive tests. The examiner completed the Impact on Performance Scale, a questionnaire evaluating mediating influences that may impact performance. Results On average, patients performed worse than controls at a large effect size. When the total score of the Impact on Performance Scale was accounted for by mediation analysis and analyses of covariance, group differences were reduced to a medium effect size. A total of 30% of patients showed impairments of at least one standard deviation below the mean. Conclusions This study confirms that neurocognitive impairment in depression is likely overestimated; future studies should consider fair test-taking conditions. We advise researchers to report percentages of patients showing performance deficits rather than relying solely on overall group differences.

The concept of dysregulated glutamatergic concentrations in specific brain regions remains controversial. Herein, we aimed to assess (i) the distribution of the glutamatergic concentration in the brain, (ii) the association between working memory (WM) differences in TRS and non-TRS patients, and (iii) whether an alteration in the glutamate (Glu) level is associated with WM. Methods The participants included 38 TRS patients, 35 non-TRS patients, and 19 healthy controls (HCs), all of whom underwent 1.5-Tesla proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). The ratios of glutamatergic neurometabolites to N-acetylaspartate + N-acetyl aspartylglutamate (NAAx) were calculated. Cognitive function was assessed using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, 4th Edition, which included the working memory index (WMI). Result The TRS patients had a higher glutamate + glutamine (Glx)/NAAx ratio compared to the non-TRS patients and HCs in the ACC, but this was not significantly different in the MPFC. WM was negatively correlated with Glx/NAAx in the ACC among the non-TRS patients, but not in the TRS patients or HCs. Conclusions Our findings were consistent with most studies indicating that the glutamatergic concentration in the ACC plays important roles in the classification of TRS and cognition. Our results may provide potential evidence for predictors and treatment response biomarkers in TRS patients. Further research is needed to probe the value using the relationship between Glu and WM as a potential prognostic predictor of schizophrenia.  © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods A cohort was formed of 20 293 young adults treated with psychological therapies in eight Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services. Pre-treatment characteristics, outcomes, and moderators of differential outcomes were compared for those who were and were not NEET. Associations between outcomes and the following were assessed for those that were NEET: missing fewer sessions, attending more sessions, having a recorded diagnosis, and waiting fewer days between referral and starting treatment. Results Those who were NEET had worse outcomes: odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for reliable recovery = 0.68 (0.63-0.74), for deterioration = 1.41 (1.25-1.60), and for attrition = 1.31 (1.19-1.43). Ethnic minority participants that were NEET had better outcomes than those that were White and NEET. Living in deprived areas was associated with worse outcomes. The intensity of treatment (high or low) did not moderate outcomes, but having more sessions was associated with improved outcomes for those that were NEET: odds (per one-session increase) of reliable recovery = 1.10 (1.08-1.12), deterioration = 0.94 (0.91-0.98), and attrition = 0.68 (0.66-0.71). Conclusions Earlier treatment, supporting those that are NEET to attend sessions, and in particular, offering them more sessions before ending treatment might be effective in improving clinical outcomes. Additional support when working with White young adults that are NEET and those in more deprived areas may also be important.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

We examined the intergenerational associations of separation anxiety and other forms of internalizing problems in an American community sample of 515 predominantly white children and their parents. Methods Children's separation anxiety (CSA), depression, and other anxiety disorders were modeled as latent factors using diagnoses from interviews and symptom scores from questionnaires completed by mothers, fathers, and children when children were 9 years old and again 3 years later. Parents' separation anxiety was assessed via a questionnaire and parents' other anxiety, depressive, and substance use disorders were assessed with a diagnostic interview when children were nine. Relationships between parents' and children's psychopathology were modeled using s.e.m. Results Mothers' and fathers' ASA were related to all three psychopathology factors in offspring, over and above other parental disorders, in concurrent and prospective analyses. CSA was also related to maternal depression concurrently and prospectively and to maternal anxiety prospectively. Of all paternal psychopathology variables, only ASA was significantly related to children's psychopathology in either model. Conclusions Results indicate that parental separation anxiety is an important, but non-specific, risk factor for children's psychopathology. The pathway by which this risk is transmitted may be genetic or environmental, and the observed statistical associations likely also encompass child-to-parent effects.  © The Author(s), 2022.

Another study showed that remitted MDD patients were able to modulate this neural signature using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback training, thereby increasing their self-esteem. The feasibility and potential of using this approach in symptomatic MDD were unknown. Method This single-blind pre-registered randomised controlled pilot trial probed a novel self-guided psychological intervention with and without additional rSATL-posterior subgenual cortex (BA25) fMRI neurofeedback, targeting self-blaming emotions in people with insufficiently recovered MDD and early treatment-resistance (n = 43, n = 35 completers). Participants completed three weekly self-guided sessions to rebalance self-blaming biases. Results As predicted, neurofeedback led to a training-induced reduction in rSATL-BA25 connectivity for self-blame v. other-blame. Both interventions were safe and resulted in a 46% reduction on the Beck Depression Inventory-II, our primary outcome, with no group differences. Secondary analyses, however, revealed that patients without DSM-5-defined anxious distress showed a superior response to neurofeedback compared with the psychological intervention, and the opposite pattern in anxious MDD. As predicted, symptom remission was associated with increases in self-esteem and this correlated with the frequency with which participants employed the psychological strategies in daily life. Conclusions These findings suggest that self-blame-rebalance neurofeedback may be superior over a solely psychological intervention in non-anxious MDD, although further confirmatory studies are needed. Simple self-guided strategies tackling self-blame were beneficial, but need to be compared against treatment-as-usual in further trials. https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN10526888  Copyright © The King's College London, 2021.

Impulsivity was shown to be strongly related to VB, and different evolutions of impulsivity were noticed along treatments. One possible variable involved in the relationship between VB and the evolution of impulsivity is cannabis use (CU). The high prevalence of CU in EPP and its relationship with VB led us to investigate: 1/the impact of CU and 2/the impact of early CU on the evolution of impulsivity levels during a 3-year program, in violent and non-violent EPP patients. Methods 178 non-violent and 62 violent patients (VPs) were followed-up over a 3 year period. Age of onset of CU was assessed at program entry and impulsivity was assessed seven times during the program. The evolution of impulsivity level during the program, as a function of the violent and non-violent groups of patients and CU precocity were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. Results Over the treatment period, impulsivity level did not evolve as a function of the interaction between group and CU (coef. = 0.02, p = 0.425). However, when including precocity of CU, impulsivity was shown to increase significantly only in VPs who start consuming before 15 years of age (coef. = 0.06, p = 0.008). Conclusion The precocity of CU in VPs seems to be a key variable of the negative evolution of impulsivity during follow-up and should be closely monitored in EPP patients entering care since they have a higher risk of showing VB.  © The Author(s), 2022.

We studied the association between a schizophrenia risk locus involving a 6.1Mb homozygous region on chromosome 13q22-31 in a consanguineous multiplex family and cognitive functioning, haemodynamic response and white matter integrity using neuroimaging. Methods We performed CANTAB neuropsychological testing on four affected family members (all homozygous for the risk locus), ten unaffected family members (seven homozygous and three heterozygous) and ten healthy volunteers, and tested neuronal responses on fMRI during an n-back working memory task, and white matter integrity on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on four affected and six unaffected family members (four homozygous and two heterozygous) and three healthy volunteers. For cognitive comparisons we used a linear mixed model (Kruskal-Wallis) test, followed by posthoc Dunn's pairwise tests with a Bonferroni adjustment. For fMRI analysis, we counted voxels exceeding the p < 0.05 corrected threshold. DTI analysis was observational. Results Family members with schizophrenia and unaffected family members homozygous for the risk haplotype showed attention (p < 0.01) and working memory deficits (p < 0.01) compared with healthy controls; a neural activation laterality bias towards the right prefrontal cortex (voxels reaching p < 0.05, corrected) and observed lower fractional anisotropy in the anterior cingulate cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

However, the progressive structural alteration pattern remains unknown. Methods To elaborate the progressive structural alteration of depression according to illness duration, we recruited 195 never-treated first-episode patients with depression and 130 healthy controls (HCs) undergoing T1-weighted MRI scans. Voxel-based morphometry method was adopted to measure gray matter volume (GMV) for each participant. Patients were first divided into three stages according to the length of illness duration, then we explored stage-specific GMV alterations and the causal effect relationship between them using causal structural covariance network (CaSCN) analysis. Results Overall, patients with depression presented stage-specific GMV alterations compared with HCs. Regions including the hippocampus, the thalamus and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) presented GMV alteration at onset of illness. Then as the illness advanced, others regions began to present GMV alterations. These results suggested that GMV alteration originated from the hippocampus, the thalamus and vmPFC then expanded to other brain regions. The results of CaSCN analysis revealed that the hippocampus and the vmPFC corporately exerted causal effect on regions such as nucleus accumbens, the precuneus and the cerebellum. In addition, GMV alteration in the hippocampus was also potentially causally related to that in the dorsolateral frontal gyrus. Conclusions Consistent with the neuroprogressive hypothesis, our results reveal progressive morphological alteration originating from the vmPFC and the hippocampus and further elucidate possible details about disease progression of depression.

Here, we assessed resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) at pre-treatment and during early treatment as a potential predictor of response to a novel attention bias modification procedure, gaze-contingent music reward therapy (GC-MRT). Methods Thirty-two adults with SAD were treated with GC-MRT. rsFC was assessed with multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI at pre-treatment and after 2-3 weeks. For comparison, 20 healthy control (HC) participants without treatment were assessed twice for rsFC over the same time period. All SAD participants underwent clinical evaluation at pre-treatment, early-treatment (week 2-3), and post-treatment. Results SAD and depressive symptoms improved significantly from pre-treatment to post-treatment. After 2-3 weeks of treatment, decreased connectivity between the executive control network (ECN) and salience network (SN), and increased connectivity within the ECN predicted improvement in SAD and depressive symptoms at week 8. Increased connectivity between the ECN and default mode network (DMN) predicted greater improvement in SAD but not depressive symptoms at week 8. Connectivity within the DMN decreased significantly after 2-3 weeks of treatment in the SAD group, while no changes were found in HC over the same time interval. Conclusion We identified early changes in rsFC during a course of GC-MRT for SAD that predicted symptom change. Connectivity changes within the ECN, ECN-DMN, and ECN-SN may be related to mechanisms underlying the clinical effects of GC-MRT and warrant further study in controlled trials.  © The Author(s), 2022.

However, inequalities in access have not been explored at the national level. Methods Using a unique individual patient dataset that linked 2011 Census information of English residents to national IAPT data collected between April 2017 and March 2018, we estimated the rate of access by a wide range of socio-demographic characteristics that are not routinely available. A large household survey was used to estimate the prevalence of probable CMDs by these socio-demographic characteristics. We estimated the probability of access to IAPT amongst people with CMDs by comparing the rates of access from IAPT data and the estimates of prevalence of CMDs from the household survey. Both unadjusted and adjusted (for important patient characteristics) access rates were estimated in logistic regression models. Results As a proportion of those with a probable CMD, access to IAPT varied markedly by socio-demographic characteristics. Older adults, males, people born outside of the UK, people with religious beliefs, people from Asian ethnic backgrounds, people reporting a disability and those without any academic or professional qualifications were underrepresented in IAPT services nationally, in adjusted models. Conclusions The identification of patients who may be underrepresented in IAPT provides an opportunity for services to target outreach and engagement with these groups.

We estimated the incidence and risk of suicide attempts and deaths during the first postpartum year in mothers who delivered via CD v. vaginally. Method All deliveries in Sweden between 1973 and 2012 were identified. The mothers were followed since delivery for 12 months or until the date of one of the outcomes (i.e. suicide attempt or death by suicide), death by other causes or emigration. Associations were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results Of 4 016 789 identified deliveries, 514 113 (12.8%) were CDs and 3 502 676 (87.2%) were vaginal deliveries. During the 12-month follow-up, 504 (0.098%) suicide attempts were observed in the CD group and 2240 (0.064%) in the vaginal delivery group (risk difference: 0.034%), while 11 (0.0037%) deaths by suicide were registered in the CD group and 109 (0.0029%) in the vaginal delivery group (risk difference: 0.008%). Compared to vaginal delivery, CD was associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts [hazard ratio (HR) 1.46; 95% CI 1.32-1.60], but not of deaths by suicide (HR 1.44; 95% CI 0.88-2.36). Conclusions Maternal suicidal behaviors during the first postpartum year were uncommon in Sweden. Compared to vaginal delivery, CD was associated with a small increased risk of suicide attempts, but not death by suicide. Improved understanding of the association between CD and maternal suicidal behaviors may promote more appropriate measures to improve maternal mental well-being and further reduce suicidal risks.

We aimed to explore the familial co-aggregation of ASD and asthma using different genetically informed designs. Methods We first examined familial co-aggregation of asthma and ASD in individuals born in Sweden from 1992 to 2007 (n = 1 569 944), including their full- and half-siblings (n = 1 704 388 and 356 544 pairs) and full cousins (n = 3 921 890 pairs), identified using Swedish register data. We then applied quantitative genetic modeling to siblings (n = 620 994 pairs) and twins who participated in the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (n = 15 963 pairs) to estimate the contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the co-aggregation. Finally, we estimated genetic correlations between traits using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC). Results We observed a within-individual association [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28-1.37] and familial co-aggregation between asthma and ASD, and the magnitude of the associations decreased as the degree of relatedness decreased (full-siblings: OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.38-1.50, maternal half-siblings: OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.18-1.39, paternal half-siblings: OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96-1.15, full cousins: OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.09), suggesting shared familial liability. Quantitative genetic models estimated statistically significant genetic correlations between ASD traits and asthma. Using the LDSC approach, we did not find statistically significant genetic correlations between asthma and ASD (coefficients between -0.09 and 0.12). Conclusions Using different genetically informed designs, we found some evidence of familial co-aggregation between asthma and ASD, suggesting the weak association between these disorders was influenced by shared genetics.  © The Author(s), 2022.

We aimed to examine the most updated evidence on the effects of psychotherapy in patients with depression and somatic disorders, including HIV, oncological, cardiometabolic, and neurological disorders. Methods We conducted a meta-analysis of 75 randomized trials (8209 participants) of psychotherapy for adults with somatic disorders and a diagnosis or elevated symptoms of depression. Outcomes included depression, QoL, somatic health-related outcomes, and mortality. Results Psychotherapy significantly reduced the severity of depression at post-treatment across all categories of somatic disorders (Hedges'g = 0.65; 95% CI 0.52-0.79), with sustained effects at 6-11 months (g = 0.38; 95% CI 0.22-0.53) and at 12 months follow-up or longer (g = 0.13; 95% CI 0.04-0.21). Psychotherapy also showed significant effects on QoL (g = 0.26; 95% CI 0.17-0.35), maintained up to 11 months follow-up (g = 0.25; 95% CI 0.16-0.34). No significant effects were observed on the most frequently reported somatic health-related outcomes (glycemic control, pain), and neither on mortality. Heterogeneity in most analyses was very high, and only 29 (38%) trials were rated at low risk of bias (RoB). Conclusions Psychotherapy may be an effective treatment option for patients with depression and somatic disorders, with long-term effects on depression severity and QoL. However, these results should be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneity and RoB. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

These changes may have particularly impacted on those with mental health problems, leading to a worsening of inequalities in the behaviours which influence health. Methods We used data from four national longitudinal British cohort studies (N = 10 666). Respondents reported mental health (psychological distress and anxiety/depression symptoms) and health behaviours (alcohol, diet, physical activity and sleep) before and during the pandemic. Associations between pre-pandemic mental ill-health and pandemic mental ill-health and health behaviours were examined using logistic regression; pooled effects were estimated using meta-analysis. Results Worse mental health was related to adverse health behaviours; effect sizes were largest for sleep, exercise and diet, and weaker for alcohol. The associations between poor mental health and adverse health behaviours were larger during the May lockdown than pre-pandemic. In September, when restrictions had eased, inequalities had largely reverted to pre-pandemic levels. A notable exception was for sleep, where differences by mental health status remained high. Risk differences for adverse sleep for those with the highest level of prior mental ill-health compared to those with the lowest were 21.2% (95% CI 16.2-26.2) before lockdown, 25.5% (20.0-30.3) in May and 28.2% (21.2-35.2) in September. Conclusions Taken together, our findings suggest that mental health is an increasingly important factor in health behaviour inequality in the COVID era. The promotion of mental health may thus be an important component of improving post-COVID population health.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

A higher polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (SzPRS) has been associated with smaller gray matter volume, lower activation, and decreased functional connectivity (FC). However, the effect of polygenic inheritance on the brain white matter microstructure has only been sparsely reported. Methods Eighty-four patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients and ninety-three healthy controls (HC) with genetics, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data were included in our study. We investigated impaired white matter integrity as measured by fractional anisotropy (FA) in the FES group, further examined the effect of SzPRS on white matter FA and FC in the regions connected by SzPRS-related white matter tracts. Results Decreased FA was observed in FES in many commonly identified regions. Among these regions, we observed that in the FES group, but not the HC group, SzPRS was negatively associated with the mean FA in the genu and body of corpus callosum, right anterior corona radiata, and right superior corona radiata. Higher SzPRS was also associated with lower FCs between the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG)-left inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), right IFG-left ITG, right IFG-left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and right IFG-right MFG in the FES group. Conclusion Higher polygenic risks are linked with disrupted white matter integrity and FC in patients with schizophrenia. These correlations are strongly driven by the interhemispheric callosal fibers and the connections between frontotemporal regions.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Methods PACAP-peptide levels were determined in a major stress-response site, the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), of people with major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and of a unique cohort of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with and without depression, all with matched controls. The expression of PACAP-(Adcyap1mRNA) and PACAP-receptors was determined in the MDD and BD patients by qPCR in presumed target sites of PACAP in stress-related disorders, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Results PACAP cell bodies and/or fibres were localised throughout the hypothalamus with differences between immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridisation. In the controls, PACAP-immunoreactivity-(ir) in the PVN was higher in women than in men. PVN-PACAP-ir was higher in male BD compared to the matched male controls. In all AD patients, the PVN-PACAP-ir was lower compared to the controls, but higher in AD depressed patients compared to those without depression. There was a significant positive correlation between the Cornell depression score and PVN-PACAP-ir in all AD patients combined. In the ACC and DLPFC, alterations in mRNA expression of PACAP and its receptors were associated with mood disorders in a differential way depending on the type of mood disorder, suicide, and psychotic features.

Clarifying the epidemiology of EDs in preadolescent children is a necessary first step to understand the nature and scope of this problem in this age group. Methods Analysis of data collected in the ABCD Study release 2.0.1. The ABCD cohort was a population-based sample that consisted of 11 721 children ages 9-10 years. Measures included reports of a lifetime and current mental disorders determined using a diagnostic interview for DSM-5 disorders, sociodemographic factors, and psychiatric treatment utilization. Results The lifetime prevalence of EDs was 0.95%. Being Black, multiracial, having unmarried parents, and family economic insecurity were significant predictors for developing an ED. Among psychiatric conditions, the major depressive disorder was most robustly associated with EDs in both cross-sectional and temporal analyses. Only 47.40% of children who had a lifetime ED received some type of psychiatric treatment. EDs were not a significant predictor of psychiatric treatment utilization after accounting for sex, sexual orientation, parent marital status, economic insecurity, and all other psychiatric diagnoses. Conclusions Despite increasing prevalence rates of preadolescent EDs, the current findings suggest that the majority of children with these disorders remain untreated. Devoting increased attention and resources to reaching families of children with EDs with the least means for receiving care, and screening for EDs in children with depression, may be important steps for reducing this unmet need.

Methods We investigated the dynamic functional connectivity (FC) by using instantaneous phase method based on Hilbert transform to detect abnormal spatiotemporal interaction in schizophrenia. Based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, two independent datasets were included, with 114 subjects from COBRE [51 schizophrenia patients (SZ) and 63 healthy controls (HCs)] and 96 from OpenfMRI (36 SZ and 60 HCs). Phase differences and instantaneous coupling matrices were firstly calculated at all time points by extracting instantaneous parameters. Global [global synchrony and intertemporal closeness (ITC)] and local dynamic features [strength of FC (sFC) and variability of FC (vFC)] were compared between two groups. Support vector machine (SVM) was used to estimate the ability to discriminate two groups by using all aberrant features. Results We found SZ had lower global synchrony and ITC than HCs on both datasets. Furthermore, SZ had a significant decrease in sFC but an increase in vFC, which were mainly located at prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, temporal cortex and visual cortex or temporal cortex and hippocampus, forming significant dynamic subnetworks. SVM analysis revealed a high degree of balanced accuracy (85.75%) on the basis of all aberrant dynamic features. Conclusions SZ has worse overall spatiotemporal stability and extensive FC subnetwork lesions compared to HCs, which to some extent elucidates the pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia, providing insight into time-variation properties of patients with other mental illnesses.

However, empirical evidence of reduced regulatory selection flexibility in PTSD is lacking. Multiple studies show that healthy individuals demonstrate regulatory selection flexibility manifested in selecting attentional disengagement regulatory strategies (e.g. distraction) in high-intensity emotional contexts and selecting engagement meaning change strategies (e.g. reappraisal) in low-intensity contexts. Accordingly, we hypothesized that PTSD populations will show reduced regulatory selection flexibility manifested in diminished increase in distraction (over reappraisal) preference as intensity increases from low to high intensity. Methods Study 1 compared student participants with high (N = 22) post-traumatic symptoms (PTS, meeting the clinical cutoff for PTSD) and participants with low (N = 22) post-traumatic symptoms. Study 2 compared PTSD diagnosed women (N = 31) due to childhood sexual abuse and matched non-clinical women (N = 31). In both studies, participants completed a well-established regulatory selection flexibility performance-based paradigm that involves selecting between distraction and reappraisal to regulate negative emotional words of low and high intensity. Results Beyond demonstrating adequate psychometric properties, Study 1 confirmed that relative to the low PTS group, the high PTS group presented reduced regulatory selection flexibility (p = 0.01, = 0.14). Study 2 critically extended findings of Study 1, in showing similar reduced regulatory selection flexibility in a diagnosed PTSD population, relative to a non-clinical population (p = 0.002, = 0.114).

Methods To test the association between peer victimization timing and intensity and mental health comorbidities, we used data from 1216 participants drawn from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, a population-based birth cohort. Peer victimization was self-reported at ages 6-17 years, and modeled as four trajectory groups: low, childhood-limited, moderate adolescence-emerging, and high-chronic. The outcomes were the number and the type of co-occurring self-reported mental health problems at age 20 years. Associations were estimated using negative binomial and multinomial logistic regression models and adjusted for parent, family, and child characteristics using propensity score inverse probability weights. Results Youth in all peer victimization groups had higher rates of co-occurring mental health problems and higher likelihood of comorbid internalizing-externalizing problems [odds ratios ranged from 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52-2.79 for childhood-limited to 4.34, 95% CI 3.15-5.98 for high-chronic victimization] compared to those in the low victimization group. The strength of these associations was highest for the high-chronic group, followed by moderate adolescence-emerging and childhood-limited groups. All groups also presented higher likelihood of internalizing-only problems relative to the low peer victimization group. Conclusions Irrespective of timing and intensity, self-reported peer victimization was associated with mental health comorbidities in young adulthood, with the strongest associations observed for high-chronic peer victimization. Tackling peer victimization, especially when persistent over time, could play a role in reducing severe and complex mental health problems in youth.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

There are no data for the magnitudes between ACEs and PD. This systematic review and meta-analysis estimated the overall, as well as the subgroups, odds ratio of having PD in adults who report ACEs, compared to adults who do not. Methods The study was pre-registered on PROSPERO [CRD42018111506] and the database was searched in June 2021. In order to overcome the violation of independent assumptions due to multiple estimations from the same samples, we utilized a robust variance estimation model that supports meta-analysis for clustered estimations. Accordingly, an advanced method relaxing the distributional and asymptotic assumptions was used to assess publication bias and sensitivity. Results The literature search and screening returned 34 final studies, comprising 192,182 participants. Ninety-six estimations of 20 types of ACEs were extracted. Pooled ORs are: overall 2.2, CI (1.82-2.58), sexual abuse 1.92, CI (1.37-2.46), physical abuse 1.71, CI (1.37-2.05), emotional abuse 1.61, CI (0.868-2.35), emotional neglect 1.53, CI (0.756-2.31), parental alcoholism 1.83, CI (1.24-2.43), and parental separation/loss 1.82, CI (1.14-2.50). No between-group difference was identified by either sociolegal classification (abuse, neglect, household dysfunction) or threat-deprivation dimensions (high on threat, high on deprivation and mixed). Conclusions There are links of mild to medium strength between overall ACEs and PD as well as individual ACEs. The homogeneous effect sizes across ACEs either suggest the effects of ACEs on PD are comparable, or raised the question whether the categorical or dimensional approaches to classifying ACEs are the definitive ways to conceptualize the impact of ACEs on later mental health.

In this study, using a rigorously phenomenological approach to elicit FRS, we examined (a) the degree to which unequivocally present FRS differentiated schizophrenia (n=513) from other psychotic disorders (n=633), and (b) the comparative validity between FRS and other reality-distortion symptoms against 16 external validators in the whole sample of psychotic disorders (n=1146). Diagnostic performance indices (with 95% CIs) of FRS for diagnosing schizophrenia were as follows: sensitivity=0.58 (0.54-0.61), specificity=0.65 (0.62-0.67), positive predictive value=0.57 (0.54-0.60) and negative predictive value=0.65 (0.63-0.68). While the overall association pattern of FRS and non-FRS scores with the validators was rather similar, three validators (premorbid social adjustment, number of hospitalizations and global assessment of functioning) were significantly related to non-FRS scores (p < 0.006) but not to FRS scores (p > 0.05). Furthermore, no validator was significantly related to FRS scores and unrelated to non-FRS scores, all of which indicates an overall better predictive validity for non-FRS delusions and hallucinations. These findings suggest that FRS do not have diagnostic value for diagnosing schizophrenia and that they do not meaningfully add to the external validity showed by other delusions and hallucinations. We believe that much of the misunderstanding about the diagnostic and clinical validity of FRS for schizophrenia is rooted in Schneider's confusing concept of the disorder.

Methods Demographic, clinical, and psychosocial measures were obtained for 276 participants from the Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode Early Treatment Program (RAISE-ETP) trial at baseline and 6-months, along with measures of social and occupational functioning from the Quality of Life Scale. The Greedy Fast Causal Inference algorithm was used to learn a partial ancestral graph modeling causal relationships across baseline variables and 6-month functioning. Effect sizes were estimated using a structural equation model. Results were validated in an independent dataset (N = 187). Results In the data-generated model, greater baseline socio-affective capacity was a cause of greater baseline motivation [Effect size (ES) = 0.77], and motivation was a cause of greater baseline social and occupational functioning (ES = 1.5 and 0.96, respectively), which in turn were causes of their own 6-month outcomes. Six-month motivation was also identified as a cause of occupational functioning (ES = 0.92). Cognitive impairment and duration of untreated psychosis were not direct causes of functioning at either timepoint. The graph for the validation dataset was less determinate, but otherwise supported the findings. Conclusions In our data-generated model, baseline socio-affective capacity and motivation are the most direct causes of occupational and social functioning 6 months after entering treatment in early schizophrenia. These findings indicate that socio-affective abilities and motivation are specific high-impact treatment needs that must be addressed in order to promote optimal social and occupational recovery.

Although cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychosocial treatment for this common disorder, how the intervention works is insufficiently understood. Specific pathways have been hypothesized, but only one small study has examined the precise nature of treatment effects of CBT, and no prior study has examined the effects of supportive psychotherapy (SPT). Methods This study re-examined a large trial (n = 120) comparing CBT to SPT for BDD. Network intervention analyses were used to explore symptom-level data across time. We computed mixed graphical models at multiple time points to examine relative differences in direct and indirect effects of the two interventions. Results In the resulting networks, CBT and SPT appeared to differentially target certain symptoms. The largest differences included CBT increasing efforts to disengage from and restructure unhelpful thoughts and resist BDD rituals, while SPT was directly related to improvement in BDD-related insight. Additionally, the time course of differences aligned with the intended targets of CBT; cognitive effects emerged first and behavioral effects second, paralleling cognitive restructuring in earlier sessions and the emphasis on exposure and ritual prevention in later sessions. Differences in favor of CBT were most consistent for behavioral targets. Conclusions CBT and SPT primarily affected different symptoms. To improve patient care, the field needs a better understanding of how and when BDD treatments and treatment components succeed. Considering patient experiences at the symptom level and over time can aid in refining or reorganizing treatments to better fit patient needs. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

However, PRSs are often associated with multiple mental health problems in children, complicating their use in research and clinical practice. The current study is the first to systematically test which PRSs associate broadly with all forms of childhood psychopathology, and which PRSs are more specific to one or a handful of forms of psychopathology. Methods The sample consisted of 4717 unrelated children (mean age = 9.92, s.d. = 0.62; 47.1% female; all European ancestry). Psychopathology was conceptualized hierarchically as empirically derived general factor (p-factor) and five specific factors: externalizing, internalizing, neurodevelopmental, somatoform, and detachment. Partial correlations explored associations between psychopathology factors and 22 psychopathology-related PRSs. Regressions tested which level of the psychopathology hierarchy was most strongly associated with each PRS. Results Thirteen PRSs were significantly associated with the general factor, most prominently Chronic Multisite Pain-PRS (r = 0.098), ADHD-PRS (r = 0.079), and Depression-PRS (r = 0.078). After adjusting for the general factor, Depression-PRS, Neuroticism-PRS, PTSD-PRS, Insomnia-PRS, Chronic Back Pain-PRS, and Autism-PRS were not associated with lower order factors. Conversely, several externalizing PRSs, including Adventurousness-PRS and Disinhibition-PRS, remained associated with the externalizing factor (|r| = 0.040-0.058). The ADHD-PRS remained uniquely associated with the neurodevelopmental factor (r = 062). Conclusions PRSs developed to predict vulnerability to emotional difficulties and chronic pain generally captured genetic risk for all forms of childhood psychopathology. PRSs developed to predict vulnerability to externalizing difficulties, e.g. disinhibition, tended to be more specific in predicting behavioral problems. The results may inform translation of existing PRSs to pediatric research and future clinical practice.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

In the largest multi-season study conducted to date, we aimed to clarify the nature and extent of hypersomnolence in SAD using multiple measurements during winter depressive episodes and summer remission. Methods Sleep measurements assessed in individuals with SAD and nonseasonal, never-depressed controls included actigraphy, daily sleep diaries, retrospective self-report questionnaires, and self-reported hypersomnia assessed via clinical interviews. To characterize hypersomnolence in SAD we (1) compared sleep between diagnostic groups and seasons, (2) examined correlates of self-reported hypersomnia in SAD, and (3) assessed agreement between commonly used measurement modalities. Results In winter compared to summer, individuals with SAD (n = 64) reported sleeping 72 min longer based on clinical interviews (p < 0.001) and 23 min longer based on actigraphy (p = 0.011). Controls (n = 80) did not differ across seasons. There were no seasonal or group differences on total sleep time when assessed by sleep diaries or retrospective self-reports (p's > 0.05). Endorsement of winter hypersomnia in SAD participants was predicted by greater fatigue, total sleep time, time in bed, naps, and later sleep midpoints (p's < 0.05). Conclusion Despite a winter increase in total sleep time and year-round elevated daytime sleepiness, the average total sleep time (7 h) suggest hypersomnolence is a poor characterization of SAD. Importantly, self-reported hypersomnia captures multiple sleep disruptions, not solely lengthened sleep duration. We recommend using a multimodal assessment of hypersomnolence in mood disorders prior to sleep intervention.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We investigated brain structure in adolescents with CD and their unaffected relatives (URs) to identify neuroanatomical markers of familial risk for CD. Methods Forty-one adolescents with CD, 24 URs of CD probands, and 38 healthy controls (aged 12-18), underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging. We performed surface-based morphometry analyses, testing for group differences in cortical volume, thickness, surface area, and folding. We also assessed the volume of key subcortical structures. Results The CD and UR groups both displayed structural alterations (lower surface area and folding) in left inferior parietal cortex compared with controls. In contrast, CD participants showed lower insula and pars opercularis volume than controls, and lower surface area and folding in these regions than controls and URs. The URs showed greater folding in rostral anterior cingulate and inferior temporal cortex than controls and greater medial orbitofrontal folding than CD participants. The surface area and volume differences were not significant when controlling for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder comorbidity. There were no group differences in subcortical volumes. Conclusions These findings suggest that alterations in inferior parietal cortical structure partly mediate the effects of familial risk for CD. These structural changes merit investigation as candidate endophenotypes for CD. Neuroanatomical changes in medial orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortex differentiated between URs and the other groups, potentially reflecting neural mechanisms of resilience to CD.

However, previous studies were rather small, only explored a few personality traits and did not include adverse drug effects nor the interdependency between antidepressant discontinuation patterns and response. Methods GENDEP included 589 patients with unipolar moderate-severe depression treated with escitalopram or nortriptyline for 12 weeks. Seven personality dimensions were measured using the self-reported 240-item Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R). We applied Cox proportional models to study discontinuation patterns, logistic and linear regression to investigate response and remission after 8 and 12 weeks, and mixed-effects linear models regarding time-varying treatment response and adverse drug reactions. Results Low harm avoidance, low cooperativeness, high self-transcendence and high novelty seeking were associated with higher risks for antidepressant discontinuation, independent of depressed mood, adverse drug reactions, drug, sex and age. Regression analyses showed that higher novelty seeking and cooperativeness scores were associated with a greater likelihood of response and remission after 8 and 12 weeks, respectively, but we found no correlations with response in the mixed-effects models. Only high harm avoidance was associated with more self-reported adverse effects. Conclusions This study, representing the largest investigation between several personality traits and response to two different antidepressants, suggests that correlations between personality traits and antidepressant treatment response may be confounded by differential rates of discontinuation. Future trials on personality in the treatment of depression need to consider this interdependency and study whether interventions aiming at improving compliance for some personality types may improve response to antidepressants.

Avoidance can be due to a variety of fears, including concerns about negative social evaluation, panicking, and harm from others. The result is inactivity and isolation. Behavioural avoidance tasks (BATs) provide an objective assessment of avoidance and in situ anxiety but are challenging to administer and lack standardisation. Our aim was to draw on the principles of BATs to develop a self-report measure of agoraphobia symptoms. Method The scale was developed with 194 patients with agoraphobia in the context of psychosis, 427 individuals in the general population with high levels of agoraphobia, and 1094 individuals with low levels of agoraphobia. Factor analysis, item response theory, and receiver operating characteristic analyses were used. Validity was assessed against a BAT, actigraphy data, and an existing agoraphobia measure. Test-retest reliability was assessed with 264 participants. Results An eight-item questionnaire with avoidance and distress response scales was developed. The avoidance and distress scales each had an excellent model fit and reliably assessed agoraphobic symptoms across the severity spectrum. All items were highly discriminative (avoidance: a = 1.24-5.43; distress: a = 1.60-5.48), indicating that small increases in agoraphobic symptoms led to a high probability of item endorsement. The scale demonstrated good internal reliability, test-retest reliability, and validity. Conclusions The Oxford Agoraphobic Avoidance Scale has excellent psychometric properties. Clinical cut-offs and score ranges are provided. This precise assessment tool may help focus attention on the clinically important problem of agoraphobic avoidance.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Two forms of affective traits that reflect the components of CD severity are callous-unemotional (CU; reduced guilt/empathy) traits and irritability. The form of the reinforcement-based decision-making dysfunction with respect to CD and CU traits remains debated and has not been examined with respect to irritability in cases with CD. The goals of the current study were to determine the extent of dysfunction in differential (reward v. punishment) responsiveness in CD, and CU traits and irritability in participants with CD. Methods The study involved 178 adolescents [typically developing (TD; N = 77) and cases with CD (N = 101)]. Participants were scanned with fMRI during a passive avoidance task that required participants to learn to respond to (i.e. approach) stimuli that engender reward and refrain from responding to (i.e. passively avoid) stimuli that engender punishment. Results Adolescents with CD showed reduced differential reward-punishment responsiveness within the striatum relative to TD adolescents. CU traits, but not irritability, were associated with reduced differential reward-punishment responsiveness within the striatum, rostromedial, and lateral frontal cortices. Conclusions The results suggest CD is associated with reduced differential reward-punishment responsiveness and the extent of this dysfunction in participants with CD is associated with the severity of CU traits but not irritability.

Methods In study 1 (N = 101), we used a subclinical sample to compare the film-based induction of sad v. happy mood with a distraction control group. Subsequently, participants underwent a well-established paradigm to examine intra-individual changes in performance-related expectations after unexpectedly positive performance feedback. In study 2, we applied the belief-updating task from study 1 to an inpatient sample (N = 81) and induced sad v. happy mood via film-clips v. recall of autobiographic events. Results The results of study 1 showed no significant group differences in belief updating; the severity of depressive symptoms was a negative predictor of belief revision, though, and there was a non-significant trend suggesting that the presence of sad mood hindered belief updating in the subgroup of participants with a diagnosed depressive episode. Study 2 revealed that participants updated their expectations significantly less in line with positive feedback when they underwent the induction of negative mood prior to feedback, relative to positive mood. Conclusions By indicating that the presence of negative mood can hinder the revision of negative beliefs in clinically depressed people, our findings suggest that learning from new experiences can be hampered if state negative mood is activated. Thus, interventions relying on learning from novel positive experiences should aim at reducing state negative mood in depression.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Previous research reported that pain-related perceived injustice covaries with these negative consequences. The current study probed whether chronic pain patients responded more strongly to disadvantageous social inequity than healthy individuals. Methods We administered the Ultimatum Game, a neuroeconomic social exchange game, where a sum of money is split between two players to a large sample of patients with chronic pain disorder with somatic and psychological factors (n = 102) and healthy controls (n = 101). Anonymised, and in truth experimentally controlled, co-players proposed a split, and our participants either accepted or rejected these offers. Results Chronic pain patients were hypersensitive to disadvantageous inequity and punished their co-players for proposed unequal splits more often than healthy controls. Furthermore, this systematic shift in social decision making was independent of patients' performance on tests of executive functions and risk-sensitive (non-social) decision making. Conclusions Our findings indicate that chronic pain is associated with anomalies in social decision making (compared to healthy controls) and hypersensitivity to social inequity that is likely to negatively impact social partaking and thereby the quality of life.

Longitudinal evaluation of psychosis spectrum features and neurocognition can establish developmental trajectories and impact on functional outcome. Methods 157 youth with 22q11DS were assessed longitudinally for psychopathology focusing on psychosis spectrum symptoms, neurocognitive performance and global functioning. We contrasted the pattern of positive and negative psychosis spectrum symptoms and neurocognitive performance differentiating those with more prominent Psychosis Spectrum symptoms (PS+) to those without prominent psychosis symptoms (PS-). Results We identified differences in the trajectories of psychosis symptoms and neurocognitive performance between the groups. The PS+ group showed age associated increase in symptom severity, especially negative symptoms and general nonspecific symptoms. Correspondingly, their level of functioning was worse and deteriorated more steeply than the PS- group. Neurocognitive performance was generally comparable in PS+ and PS- groups and demonstrated a similar age-related trajectory. However, worsening executive functioning distinguished the PS+ group from PS- counterparts. Notably, of the three executive function measures examined, only working memory showed a significant difference between the groups in rate of change. Finally, structural equation modeling showed that neurocognitive decline drove the clinical change. Conclusions Youth with 22q11DS and more prominent psychosis features show worsening of symptoms and functional decline driven by neurocognitive decline, most related to executive functions and specifically working memory. The results underscore the importance of working memory in the developmental progression of psychosis.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

This study sought to explore this paradoxical relationship connecting key parameters of the psychotic experience, psychotherapy, and psychedelic experience. Methods In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 24 healthy volunteers received 50 g d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or inactive placebo. Psychotic experience was assessed by aberrant salience (Aberrant Salience Inventory, ASI), therapeutic potential by suggestibility (Creative Imagination Scale, CIS) and mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, FFMQ; Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS; Experiences Questionnaire, EQ), and psychedelic experience by four questionnaires (Altered State of Consciousness Questionnaire, ASC; Mystical Experiences Questionnaire, MEQ; Challenging Experiences Questionnaire, CEQ; Ego-Dissolution Inventory, EDI). Relationships between LSD-induced effects were examined. Results LSD induced psychedelic experiences, including alteration of consciousness, mystical experiences, ego-dissolution, and mildly challenging experiences, increased aberrant salience and suggestibility, but not mindfulness. LSD-induced aberrant salience correlated highly with complex imagery, mystical experiences, and ego-dissolution. LSD-induced suggestibility correlated with no other effects. Individual mindfulness changes correlated with aspects of aberrant salience and psychedelic experience. Conclusions The LSD state resembles a psychotic experience and offers a tool for healing. The link between psychosis model and therapeutic model seems to lie in mystical experiences. The results point to the importance of meaning attribution for the LSD psychosis model and indicate that psychedelic-assisted therapy might benefit from therapeutic suggestions fostering mystical experiences.  © The Author(s), 2021.

However, few studies have tested these predictions directly. Method We used counterfactually based causal mediation to assess whether unhelpful coping strategies mediated the relationship between (1) loss-related memory characteristics and/or (2) negative grief-related appraisals and symptoms of PGD, PTSD and depression using a three-wave longitudinal sample (N = 275). Appraisals and memory characteristics were measured at time point 1, unhelpful coping strategies at T2, and symptom variables at T3. Additionally, multiple mediation analyses within a structural equation modelling (SEM) framework assessed which types of coping strategies differentially mediated symptoms of PGD, PTSD and depression. Results Coping strategies mediated the relationship between negative appraisals and memory characteristics and symptoms of PGD, PTSD and depression after adjusting for demographics and loss characteristics. Sensitivity analyses suggested that these results were most robust for PGD, followed by PTSD and then depression. Multiple mediation analyses suggested that all four subscales (avoidance, proximity seeking, loss rumination and injustice rumination) individually mediated the effect of memory characteristics and appraisals on PGD. Conclusions These results suggest that core predictions of the cognitive model for PTSD and the cognitive behavioural model of PGD are useful in predicting symptoms of post-loss mental health problems in the first 12-18 months after loss. Targeting unhelpful coping strategies is likely to reduce symptoms of PGD, PTSD and depression.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

However, much of this research has been done with cross-sectional samples, often years after trauma exposure, using self-report methodology only, and is focused on intimate relationship adjustment. Methods The current study investigated the longitudinal associations between interpersonal (intimate and non-intimate) relationship functioning and clinician- and self-reported posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in 151 recently (within the past 6 months) traumatized individuals. Participants were assessed at four time points over 1 year. Results Approximately 53% of the sample was diagnosed with PTSD at initial assessment, with declining rates of diagnostic status over time to 16%. Latent difference score (LDS) modeling revealed nonlinear declines in both clinician-assessed and self-reported PTSD symptom severity, with faster declines in earlier periods. Likewise, LDS models revealed nonlinear declines in negative (conflict) aspects of interpersonal relationship functioning, but linear declines in positive (support, depth) aspects. The relationship between PTSD and relationship functioning differed for clinician- and self-reported PTSD. Bivariate LDS modeling revealed significant cross-lagged effects from relationship conflict to clinician-assessed PTSD, and significant cross-lagged effects from self-reported PTSD to relationship conflict over time. Conclusions These results highlight that the variability in prior results may be related to the method of assessing PTSD symptomatology and different relational constructs. Implications for theory and early intervention are discussed. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

This proposal has been linked to abnormal (reduced) dopamine function in the disorder, because phasic release of dopamine is known to code for reward prediction error (RPE). Nevertheless, few functional imaging studies have examined if patients with negative symptoms show reduced RPE-associated activations. Methods Matched groups of DSM-5 schizophrenia patients with high negative symptom scores (HNS, N = 27) or absent negative symptoms (ANS, N = 27) and healthy controls (HC, N = 30) underwent fMRI scanning while they performed a probabilistic monetary reward task designed to generate a measure of RPE. Results In the HC, whole-brain analysis revealed that RPE was positively associated with activation in the ventral striatum, the putamen, and areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, among other regions. Group comparison revealed no activation differences between the healthy controls and the ANS patients. However, compared to the ANS patients, the HNS patients showed regions of significantly reduced activation in the left ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and in the right lingual and fusiform gyrus. HNS and ANS patients showed no activation differences in ventral striatal or midbrain regions-of-interest (ROIs), but the HNS patients showed reduced activation in a left orbitofrontal cortex ROI. Conclusions The findings do not suggest that a generalized reduction of RPE signalling underlies negative symptoms.

Declines in IQ mark the onset of schizophrenia, while stability is generally found post-onset. There are to date few studies on long-term IQ development in bipolar disorder. This study presents 10-year follow-up data on IQ, including premorbid IQ estimates, to track the developmental course from pre-onset levels to long-term outcomes in both patient groups compared to healthy controls. Methods We included 139 participants with schizophrenia, 76 with bipolar disorder and 125 healthy controls. Mixed model analyses were used to estimate developmental slopes for IQ scores from estimated premorbid level (NART IQ) through baseline (WASI IQ) measured within 12 months post-onset, to 10-year follow-up (WASI IQ), with pairwise group comparisons. The best fit was found using a model with a breakpoint at baseline assessment. Results Only the schizophrenia group had significant declines from estimated premorbid to baseline IQ levels compared to controls. When comparing patient groups, schizophrenia patients had steeper declines than the bipolar group. Increases in IQ were found in all groups over the follow-up period. Conclusions Trajectories of IQ from premorbid level to 10-year follow-up indicated declines from estimated premorbid level to illness onset in both patient groups, followed by increases during the follow-up period. Schizophrenia patients had a steeper decline than bipolar patients. During follow-up, increases indicate developmental improvement for both patient groups, but with a maintained lag compared to healthy controls due to lower premorbid levels.

These physical comorbidities have been linked to diet, inactivity and the effects of the illness itself, including disorganisation, impairments in global function and amotivation associated with negative symptoms of schizophrenia or co-morbid depression. Methods We aimed to describe the dietary intake, physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour patterns of a sample of patients with established psychosis participating in the Improving Physical Health and Reducing Substance Use in Severe Mental Illness (IMPaCT) randomised controlled trial, and to explore the relationship between these lifestyle factors and mental health symptomatology. Results A majority of participants had poor dietary quality, low in fruit and vegetables and high in discretionary foods. Only 29.3% completed ≥150 min of moderate and/or vigorous activity per week and 72.2% spent ≥6 h per day sitting. Cross-sectional associations between negative symptoms, global function, and PA and sedentary behaviour were observed. Additionally, those with more negative symptoms receiving IMPaCT therapy had fewer positive changes in PA from baseline to 12-month follow-up than those with fewer negative symptoms at baseline. Conclusion These results highlight the need for the development of multidisciplinary lifestyle and exercise interventions to target eating habits, PA and sedentary behaviour, and the need for further research on how to adapt lifestyle interventions to baseline mental status. Negative symptoms in particular may reduce patient's responses to lifestyle interventions.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Recent research however has not observed consistent racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic stress in the early aftermath of trauma, suggesting that such differences in chronic PTSD rates may be related to differences in recovery over time. Methods As part of the multisite, longitudinal AURORA study, we investigated racial/ethnic differences in PTSD and related outcomes within 3 months after trauma. Participants (n = 930) were recruited from emergency departments across the USA and provided periodic (2 weeks, 8 weeks, and 3 months after trauma) self-report assessments of PTSD, depression, dissociation, anxiety, and resilience. Linear models were completed to investigate racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic dysfunction with subsequent follow-up models assessing potential effects of prior life stressors. Results Racial/ethnic groups did not differ in symptoms over time; however, Black participants showed reduced posttraumatic depression and anxiety symptoms overall compared to Hispanic participants and White participants. Racial/ethnic differences were not attenuated after accounting for differences in sociodemographic factors. However, racial/ethnic differences in depression and anxiety were no longer significant after accounting for greater prior trauma exposure and childhood emotional abuse in White participants. Conclusions The present findings suggest prior differences in previous trauma exposure partially mediate the observed racial/ethnic differences in posttraumatic depression and anxiety symptoms following a recent trauma. Our findings further demonstrate that racial/ethnic groups show similar rates of symptom recovery over time. Future work utilizing longer time-scale data is needed to elucidate potential racial/ethnic differences in long-term symptom trajectories. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Previous studies have demonstrated substantial associations between substance use disorders (SUD) and suicidal behavior. The current study empirically assesses the extent to which shared genetic and/or environmental factors contribute to associations between alcohol use disorders (AUD) or drug use disorders (DUD) and suicidal behavior, including attempts and death. Methods. The authors used Swedish national registry data, including medical, pharmacy, criminal, and death registrations, for a large cohort of twins, full siblings, and half siblings (N = 1 314 990) born 1960-1980 and followed through 2017. They conducted twin-sibling modeling of suicide attempt (SA) or suicide death (SD) with AUD and DUD to estimate genetic and environmental correlations between outcomes. Analyses were stratified by sex. Results. Genetic correlations between SA and SUD ranged from rA = 0.60-0.88; corresponding shared environmental correlations were rC = 0.42-0.89 but accounted for little overall variance; and unique environmental correlations were rE = 0.42-0.57. When replacing attempt with SD, genetic and shared environmental correlations with AUD and DUD were comparable (rA = 0.48-0.72, rC = 0.92-1.00), but were attenuated for unique environmental factors (rE = −0.01 to 0.31). Conclusions. These findings indicate that shared genetic and unique environmental factors contribute to comorbidity of suicidal behavior and SUD, in conjunction with previously reported causal associations. Thus, each outcome should be considered an indicator of risk for the others. Opportunities for joint prevention and intervention, while limited by the polygenic nature of these outcomes, may be feasible considering moderate environmental correlations between SA and SUD. © The Author(s), 2021.

The aim of this study was to examine longitudinal changes in depression risk before and during COVID-19 in a cohort of emerging adults in the U.S. and to determine whether prior drinking or sleep habits could predict the severity of depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Methods Participants were 525 emerging adults from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), a five-site community sample including moderate-to-heavy drinkers. Poisson mixed-effect models evaluated changes in the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-10) from before to during COVID-19, also testing for sex and age interactions. Additional analyses examined whether alcohol use frequency or sleep duration measured in the last pre-COVID assessment predicted pandemic-related increase in depressive symptoms. Results The prevalence of risk for clinical depression tripled due to a substantial and sustained increase in depressive symptoms during COVID-19 relative to pre-COVID years. Effects were strongest for younger women. Frequent alcohol use and short sleep duration during the closest pre-COVID visit predicted a greater increase in COVID-19 depressive symptoms. Conclusions The sharp increase in depression risk among emerging adults heralds a public health crisis with alarming implications for their social and emotional functioning as this generation matures. In addition to the heightened risk for younger women, the role of alcohol use and sleep behavior should be tracked through preventive care aiming to mitigate this looming mental health crisis.

Different proxies have been used to estimate CR among individuals. A composite score of these proxies could elucidate the role of CR at illness onset on the variability of clinical and neurocognitive outcomes. Methods Premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ), years of education and premorbid adjustment were explored as proxies of CR in a large sample (N = 424) of first-episode psychosis (FEP) non-affective patients. Clusters of patients were identified and compared based on premorbid, clinical and neurocognitive variables at baseline. Additionally, the clusters were compared at 3-year (N = 362) and 10-year (N = 150) follow-ups. Results The FEP patients were grouped into five CR clusters: C1 (low premorbid IQ, low education and poor premorbid) 14%; C2 (low premorbid IQ, low education and good premorbid adjustment) 29%; C3 (normal premorbid IQ, low education and poor premorbid adjustment) 17%; C4 (normal premorbid IQ, medium education and good premorbid adjustment) 25%; and C5 (normal premorbid IQ, higher education and good premorbid adjustment) 15%. In general, positive and negative symptoms were more severe in the FEP patients with the lowest CR at baseline and follow-up assessments, while those with high CR presented and maintained higher levels of cognitive functioning. Conclusions CR could be considered a key factor at illness onset and a moderator of outcomes in FEP patients. A high CR could function as a protective factor against cognitive impairment and severe symptomatology. Clinical interventions focused on increasing CR and documenting long-term benefits are interesting and desirable.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Interventions based on trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy have shown promising results to facilitate recovery. The current trial evaluated whether a novel, scalable and digital early version of the intervention, Condensed Internet-Delivered Prolonged Exposure (CIPE), is effective in reducing post-traumatic stress symptoms. Method A single-site randomised controlled trial with self-referred adults (N = 102) exposed to trauma within the last 2 months. The participants were randomised to 3 weeks of CIPE or a waiting list (WL) for 7 weeks. Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 1-3 (primary endpoint), week 4-7 (secondary endpoint) and at 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Results The main analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle indicated statistically significant reductions in symptoms of post-traumatic stress in the CIPE group as compared to the WL group. The between-group effect size was moderate at week 3 (bootstrapped d = 0.70; 95% CI 0.33-1.06) and large at week 7 (bootstrapped d = 0.83; 95% CI 0.46-1.19). Results in the intervention group were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. No severe adverse events were found. Conclusions CIPE is a scalable intervention that may confer early benefits on post-traumatic stress symptoms in survivors of trauma. The next step is to compare this intervention to an active control group and also investigate its effects when implemented in regular care.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods A prospective cohort study of 1 965 214 individuals born in Sweden between 1971 and 1990 examining the independent effects of interpersonal and non-interpersonal TE on incidence of PTSD and NAPD using data from linked register data (Psychiatry-Sweden). Mediation analyses tested the hypothesis that PTSD lies on a causal pathway between interpersonal trauma and NAPD. Results Increasing doses of interpersonal and non-interpersonal TE were independently associated with increased risk of NAPD [linear-trend incidence rate ratios (IRR)adjusted = 2.17 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.02-2.33] and IRRadjusted = 1.27 (95% CI 1.23-1.31), respectively]. These attenuated to a relatively small degree in 5-year time-lagged models. A similar pattern of results was observed for PTSD [linear-trend IRRadjusted = 3.43 (95% CI 3.21-3.66) and IRRadjusted = 1.45 (95% CI 1.39-1.50)]. PTSD was associated with increased risk of NAPD [IRRadjusted = 8.06 (95% CI 7.23-8.99)], which was substantially attenuated in 5-year time-lagged analyses [IRRadjusted = 4.62 (95% CI 3.65-5.87)]. There was little evidence that PTSD diagnosis mediated the relationship between interpersonal TE and NAPD [IRRadjusted = 0.92 (percentile CI 0.80-1.07)]. Conclusion Despite the limitations to causal inference inherent in observational designs, the large effect-sizes observed between trauma, PTSD and NAPD in this study, consistent across sensitivity analyses, suggest that trauma may be a component cause of psychotic disorders. However, PTSD diagnosis might not be a good proxy for the likely complex psychological mechanisms mediating this association.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods Data were obtained from a recent trial in which we compared the health outcomes between a prolonged EW group (12 sessions) and a standard EW group (four sessions) (n = 56 per group) of BC patients receiving chemotherapy. The Chinese texts were tokenized using the THU Lexical Analyser for Chinese. Then, LIWC2015 was used to quantify positive and negative affect word use. Results Our first hypothesis that BC patients with higher levels of emotional expressivity tended to use higher levels of positive and negative affect words in texts was not supported (r = 0.067, p = 0.549 and r = 0.065, p = 0.559, respectively). The level of emotional expressivity has a significant effect on the quality of life (QOL), and those who used more positive or fewer negative affective words in texts had a better QOL (all p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was identified in physical and psychological well-being (all p > 0.05). Furthermore, the patterns of affective word use during EW did not mediate the effects of emotional expressivity on health outcomes (all p > 0.05). Conclusions Our findings suggest that the level of emotional expressivity and the pattern of affective word use could be factors that may moderate the effects of EW on QOL, which may help clinicians identify the individuals most likely to benefit from such writing exercises in China.  © The Author(s), 2021.

We set out to provide an assessment of positive self-beliefs that could be used in research and clinical practice. Methods A non-probability online survey was conducted with 2500 UK adults, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, ethnicity, income, and region. Exploratory factor analysis of a 94-item pool - generated with guidance from people with lived experience of mental health difficulties - was conducted to develop the Oxford Positive Self Scale (OxPos). The item pool was further reduced using regularised structural equation modelling (SEM) before confirmatory factor analysis. Optimal cut-off scores were developed using receiver operating characteristic curves. Additional validations were carried out with two further general population cohorts (n = 1399; n = 1693). Results A 24-item scale was developed with an excellent model fit [robust χ2 = 995.676; df = 246; CFI = 0.956; TLI = 0.951; RMSEA = 0.049 (0.047, 0.052); SRMR = 0.031]. The scale comprises four factors: mastery; strength; enjoyment; and character. SEM indicated that the scale explains 68.6% of variance in psychological well-being. The OxPos score was negatively correlated with depression (r = -0.49), anxious avoidance (r = -0.34), paranoia (r = -0.23), hallucinations (r = -0.20), and negative self-beliefs (r = -0.50), and positively correlated with psychological well-being (r = 0.79), self-esteem (r = 0.67), and positive social comparison (r = 0.72). Internal reliability and test-retest reliability were excellent. Cut-offs by age and gender were generated. A short-form was developed, explaining 96% of the full-scale variance. Conclusions The new open access scale provides a psychometrically robust assessment of positive cognitions that are strongly connected to psychological well-being. © The Author(s), 2023.

The aim of this multicentre case-control study was to examine and compare the characteristics of a group of forensic psychiatric patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorders and a history of significant interpersonal violence to a group of patients with the same diagnosis but no lifetime history of interpersonal violence. Method Overall, 398 patients (221 forensic and 177 non-forensic patients) were recruited across five European Countries (Italy, Germany, Poland, Austria and the United Kingdom) and assessed using a multidimensional standardised process. Results The most common primary diagnosis in both groups was schizophrenia (76.4%), but forensic patients more often met criteria for a comorbid personality disorder, almost always antisocial personality disorder (49.1 v. 0%). The forensic patients reported lower levels of disability and better social functioning. Forensic patients were more likely to have been exposed to severe violence in childhood. Education was a protective factor against future violence as well as higher levels of disability, lower social functioning and poorer performances in cognitive processing speed tasks, perhaps as proxy markers of the negative syndrome of schizophrenia. Forensic patients were typically already known to services and in treatment at the time of their index offence, but often poorly compliant. Conclusions This study highlights the need for general services to stratify patients under their care for established violence risk factors, to monitor patients for poor compliance and to intervene promptly in order to prevent severe violent incidents in the most clinically vulnerable.

However, not all children with anxiety/withdrawal problems will experience an AD in later life. Previous studies have shown that the severity of childhood anxiety/withdrawal accounts for some of the variability in AD outcomes. However, no studies to date have investigated how variation in features of anxiety/withdrawal may relate to continuity prognoses. The present research addresses this gap. Methods Data were gathered as part of the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a 40-year population birth cohort of 1265 children born in Christchurch, New Zealand. Fifteen childhood anxiety/withdrawal items were measured at 7-9 years and AD outcomes were measured at various interviews from 15 to 40 years. Six network models were estimated. Two models estimated the network structure of childhood anxiety/withdrawal items independently for males and females. Four models estimated childhood anxiety/withdrawal items predicting adolescent AD (14-21 years) and adult AD (21-40 years) in both males and females. Results Approximately 40% of participants met the diagnostic criteria for an AD during both the adolescent (14-21 years) and adult (21-40 years) outcome periods. Outcome networks showed that items measuring social and emotional anxious/withdrawn behaviours most frequently predicted AD outcomes. Items measuring situation-based fears and authority figure-specific anxious/withdrawn behaviour did not consistently predict AD outcomes. This applied across both the male and female subsamples. Conclusions Social and emotional anxious/withdrawn behaviours in middle childhood appear to carry increased risk for AD outcomes in both adolescence and adulthood.  © The Author(s), 2021.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of physical exercise in improving this cognitive function in schizophrenia. Methods A three-arm parallel open-labeled RCT took place in a university hospital. Participants were randomized and allocated into either the high-intensity-interval-training group (HIIT), aerobic-endurance exercise group (AE), or psychoeducation group for 12 weeks, with three sessions per week. Seventy-nine individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorder were contacted and screened for their eligibility. A total of 51 were successfully recruited in the study. The primary outcome was sleep-dependent procedural memory consolidation performance as measured by the finger-tapping motor sequence task (MST). Assessments were conducted during baseline and follow-up on week 12. Results The MST performance scored significantly higher in the HIIT (n = 17) compared to the psychoeducation group (n = 18) after the week 12 intervention (p < 0.001). The performance differences between the AE (n = 16) and the psychoeducation (p = 0.057), and between the AE and the HIIT (p = 0.999) were not significant. Yet, both HIIT (p < 0.0001) and AE (p < 0.05) showed significant within-group post-intervention improvement. Conclusions Our results show that HIIT and AE were effective at reverting the defective sleep-dependent procedural memory consolidation in individuals with schizophrenia. Moreover, HIIT had a more distinctive effect compared to the control group. These findings suggest that HIIT may be a more effective treatment to improve sleep-dependent memory functions in individuals with schizophrenia than AE alone.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

In this study, short- and longer-term effects of a brief self-affirmation intervention framed in terms of implementation intentions (if-then plans with self-affirming cognitions; S-AII) were evaluated against an active control group (non-affirming implementation intentions; N-AII), matched to the target condition, and mere goal intention condition (a non-active control) in adults with psoriasis. The three pre-registered primary outcomes captured depression, anxiety, and well-being. Methods Adults with psoriasis (N = 175; Mage = 36.53, s.d. = 11.52) were randomized into S-AII, N-AII, or control. Participants' mental health outcomes were assessed prior to randomization (at baseline), at week 2 (post-intervention), and at a 1-month follow-up. Results Linear mixed models were used and results were reported on the intention-to-treat principle. Analyses revealed that S-AII exerted significantly more improvement in the course of well-being (ds > 0.25), depressive symptoms (ds > -0.40), and anxiety (ds > -0.45) than the N-AII and control group at 2-week post-intervention. Though the differences between groups faded at 1-month follow-up, the within-group changes over time for S-AII in all mental health outcomes remained significant. Conclusions Brief and low-intensity S-AII intervention exerted in the short-term a considerable impact on mental health outcomes. The S-AII shows promising results as a relevant public mental health strategy for enhancing well-being and reducing psychological distress. Future studies could consider whether these effects can be further enhanced with booster interventions. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

This link may be mediated by psychosocial and biological factors, but evidence is lacking. The current study evaluates this mediation model. Method We analyzed data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (N = 27 170 community participants). Participants were 45-85 years at recruitment, when allostatic load and social engagement data were collected, and 3 years older at follow-up, when ACEs and multimorbidity data were collected. Structural equation modeling was used to test for mediation in the overall sample, and in sex- and age-stratified subsamples, all analyses adjusted for concurrent lifestyle confounds. Results In the overall sample, ACEs were associated with multimorbidity, directly, β = 0.12 (95% confidence interval 0.11-0.13) and indirectly. Regarding indirect associations, ACEs were related to social engagement, β = -0.14 (-0.16 to -0.12) and social engagement was related to multimorbidity, β = -0.10 (-0.12 to -0.08). ACEs were related to allostatic load, β = 0.04 (0.03-0.05) and allostatic load was related to multimorbidity, β = 0.16 (0.15-0.17). The model was significant for males and females and across age cohorts, with qualifications in the oldest stratum (age 75-85). Conclusions ACEs are related to multimorbidity, directly and via social engagement and allostatic load. This is the first study to show mediated pathways between early adversity and multimorbidity in adulthood. It provides a platform for understanding multimorbidity as a lifespan dynamic informing the co-occurrence of the varied disease processes represented in multimorbidity.

Resting-state functional connectivity was used to determine the strength of functional connectivity within and between OST, CON, and DMN. Results Functional connectivity within the CON was significantly greater in the OCD group as compared to the anxiety and healthy control groups. Additionally, the OCD group displayed greater functional connectivity between OST and CON compared to the other two groups, which did not differ significantly from each other. Conclusions Our findings indicate that previously noted network connectivity differences in pediatric patients with OCD were likely not attributable to co-morbid anxiety disorders. Moreover, these results suggest that specific patterns of hyperconnectivity within CON and between CON and OST circuitry may characterize OCD relative to non-OCD anxiety disorders in youth. This study improves understanding of network dysfunction underlying pediatric OCD as compared to pediatric anxiety.  © The Author(s), 2021.

It has been hypothesised that the opportunity cost of time (OCT) may be a key computational variable linking self-initiated behaviour with motivational status. OCT represents the amount of reward which is foregone per second if no action is taken. Using a novel behavioural task and computational modelling, we investigated the relationship between OCT, self-initiation and apathy. We predicted that higher OCT would engender shorter action latencies, and that individuals with greater sensitivity to OCT would have higher behavioural apathy. Methods We modulated the OCT in a novel task called the 'Fisherman Game', Participants freely chose when to self-initiate actions to either collect rewards, or on occasion, to complete non-rewarding actions. We measured the relationship between action latencies, OCT and apathy for each participant across two independent non-clinical studies, one under laboratory conditions (n = 21) and one online (n = 90). 'Average-reward' reinforcement learning was used to model our data. We replicated our findings across both studies. Results We show that the latency of self-initiation is driven by changes in the OCT. Furthermore, we demonstrate, for the first time, that participants with higher apathy showed greater sensitivity to changes in OCT in younger adults. Our model shows that apathetic individuals experienced greatest change in subjective OCT during our task as a consequence of being more sensitive to rewards. Conclusions Our results suggest that OCT is an important variable for determining free-operant action initiation and understanding apathy.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

The present study investigated the putative association between the serum-based protein markers of brain damage neurofilament light (NF-L), tau protein, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and cortical thinning in acute AN. Methods Blood samples and magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained from 52 predominantly adolescent, female patients with AN before and after partial weight restoration (increase in body mass index >14%). The effect of marker levels before weight gain and change in marker levels on cortical thickness (CT) was modeled at each vertex of the cortical surface using linear mixed-effect models. To test whether the observed effects were specific to AN, follow-up analyses exploring a potential general association of marker levels with CT were conducted in a female healthy control (HC) sample (n = 147). Results In AN, higher baseline levels of NF-L, an established marker of axonal damage, were associated with lower CT in several regions, with the most prominent clusters located in bilateral temporal lobes. Tau protein and GFAP were not associated with CT. In HC, no associations between damage marker levels and CT were detected. Conclusions A speculative interpretation would be that cortical thinning in acute AN might be at least partially a result of axonal damage processes. Further studies should thus test the potential of serum NF-L to become a reliable, low-cost and minimally invasive marker of structural brain alterations in AN.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

Recent work has shown the gut microbiome is important in modulating mental and physical health through the gut-brain axis. Yet, its association with emotions and emotion regulation are understudied. Here we examined whether positive and negative emotions, as well as two emotion regulation strategies (i.e. cognitive reappraisal and suppression), were associated with the gut microbiome composition and functional pathways in healthy women. Methods Participants were from the Mind-Body Study (N = 206, mean age = 61), a sub-study of the Nurses' Health Study II cohort. In 2013, participants completed measures of emotion-related factors. Two pairs of stool samples were collected, 6 months apart, 3 months after emotion-related factors measures were completed. Analyses examined associations of emotion-related factors with gut microbial diversity, overall microbiome structure, and specific species/pathways and adjusted for relevant covariates. Results Alpha diversity was negatively associated with suppression. In multivariate analysis, positive emotions were inversely associated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes bacterium CAG 94 and Ruminococcaceae bacterium D16, while negative emotions were directly correlated with the relative abundance of these same species. At the metabolic pathway level, negative emotions were inversely related to the biosynthesis of pantothenate, coenzyme A, and adenosine. Conclusions These findings offer human evidence supporting linkages of emotions and related regulatory processes with the gut microbiome and highlight the importance of incorporating the gut microbiome in our understanding of emotion-related factors and their associations with physical health.

Developing effective therapy for these children is critical to reduce mental disorders across the lifespan. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combining cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and sertraline (SERT) in the treatment of anxiety in youth, using a double-blind randomised control trial design. Methods Ninety-nine youth (ages 7-15 years) with an anxiety disorder were randomly allocated to either individual (CBT) and SERT or individual CBT and pill placebo and assessed again immediately and 6 months after treatment. Results There were no significant differences between conditions in remission of primary anxiety disorder or all anxiety disorders. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in rates of change in diagnostic severity, parent-reported anxiety symptoms, child-reported anxiety symptoms or life interference due to anxiety. Conclusions The efficacy of CBT for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders is not significantly enhanced by combination with a short-term course of anti-depressants over and above the combined effects of pill placebo.

Mounting evidence indicates that young children with later ASD attend less to other people, which could compromise learning opportunities with cascading effects. Passive looking behaviour does not tell us about engagement with visual information, but measures of physiological arousal can provide information on the depth of engagement. In the current study, we use heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) to measure engagement with social dynamic stimuli in ASD. Methods Sixty-seven preschoolers with ASD and 65 typical developing preschoolers between 2 and 4 years of age participated in a study where HR was measured during viewing of social and non-social videos. Using latent profile analyses, more homogeneous subgroups of children were created based on phenotype and physiology. Results Preschool-aged children with ASD, regardless of their non-verbal, verbal and social competencies, do not differ in overall HR or HRV compared to TD children. However, the ASD group showed a larger increase in HR (more disengagement) than the TD group to later-presented social stimuli. Phenotypic and physiological profiles showed this was primarily the case for children with below average verbal and non-verbal skills, but not necessarily those with more ASD symptoms. Conclusion Children with ASD, especially a subgroup showing moderate cognitive delays, show an increase in HR to social stimuli over time; this may reflect difficulties re-engaging with social information when attention is waning.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, but its neuropsychiatric implications in adolescents have not been examined. Methods Twelve- to 17-year-old unmedicated females with major depressive or anxiety disorders or with no psychopathology underwent a comprehensive psychiatric assessment for this pilot study. A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan was obtained, segmented using Freesurfer. Serum ferritin concentration (sF) was measured. Correlational analyses examined the association between body iron stores, psychiatric symptom severity, and basal ganglia volumes, accounting for confounding variables. Results Forty females were enrolled, 73% having a major depressive and/or anxiety disorder, 35% with sF < 15 ng/mL, and 50% with sF < 20 ng/mL. Serum ferritin was inversely correlated with both anxiety and depressive symptom severity (r = -0.34, p < 0.04 and r = -0.30, p < 0.06, respectively). Participants with sF < 15 ng/mL exhibited more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms as did those with sF < 20 ng/mL. Moreover, after adjusting for age and total intracranial volume, sF was inversely associated with left caudate (Spearman's r = -0.46, p < 0.04), left putamen (r = -0.58, p < 0.005), and right putamen (r = -0.53, p < 0.01) volume. Conclusions Brain iron may become depleted at a sF concentration higher than the established threshold to diagnose iron deficiency (i.e. 15 ng/mL), potentially disrupting brain maturation and contributing to the emergence of internalizing disorders in adolescents.

Importantly, despite the increasing rates of cannabis use and widespread legalization in the United States, the neural mechanisms underlying attentional dysfunction in chronic users are poorly understood. Methods We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a modified Posner cueing task in 21 regular cannabis users and 32 demographically matched non-user controls. MEG data were imaged in the time-frequency domain using a beamformer and peak voxel time series were extracted to quantify the oscillatory dynamics underlying use-related aberrations in attentional reorienting, as well as the impact on spontaneous neural activity immediately preceding stimulus onset. Results Behavioral performance on the task (e.g. reaction time) was similar between regular cannabis users and non-user controls. However, the neural data indicated robust theta-band synchronizations across a distributed network during attentional reorienting, with activity in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri being markedly stronger in users relative to controls (p's < 0.036). Additionally, we observed significantly reduced spontaneous theta activity across this distributed network during the pre-stimulus baseline in cannabis users relative to controls (p's < 0.020). Conclusions Despite similar performance on the task, we observed specific alterations in the neural dynamics serving attentional reorienting in regular cannabis users compared to controls. These data suggest that regular cannabis users may employ compensatory processing in the prefrontal cortices to efficiently reorient their attention relative to non-user controls.

Methods Adults (N = 588) who engaged in binge drinking or illicit drug use and endorsed at least one DSM-5 SUD criterion were included. DSM-5 SUD criteria were assessed for alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, heroin, and opioids. Craving was considered positive if wanted to use so badly that could not think of anything else (severe craving) or felt a very strong desire or urge to use (moderate craving) was endorsed. Baseline information on substance-related variables and psychopathology was collected, and electronic daily assessment queried substance use for the following 90 days. For each substance, logistic regression estimated the association between craving and validators, i.e. variables expected to be related to craving/SUD, and whether association with the validators differed for DSM-5 SUD diagnosed with craving as a criterion v. without. Results Across substances, craving was associated with most baseline validators (p values<0.05); neither moderate nor severe craving consistently showed greater associations. Baseline craving predicted subsequent use [odds ratios (OR): 4.2 (alcohol) - 234.3 (heroin); p's © 0.0001], with stronger associations for moderate than severe craving (p's < 0.05). Baseline DSM-5 SUD showed stronger associations with subsequent use when diagnosed with craving than without (p's < 0.05). Conclusion The DSM-5 craving criterion as operationalized in this study is valid. Including craving improves the validity of DSM-5 SUD diagnoses, and clinical relevance, since craving may cause impaired control over use and development and maintenance of SUD.

Most prior research on these issues was cross-sectional, however, and restricted to attitudes or behavioral intentions. The current research was designed to examine to what extent conspiracy beliefs predict health behavior and well-being over a longer period of time. Methods In this preregistered multi-wave study on a large Dutch research panel (weighted to provide nationally representative population estimates), we examined if conspiracy beliefs early in the pandemic (April 2020) would predict a range of concrete health and well-being outcomes eight months later (December 2020; N = 5745). Results The results revealed that Covid-19 conspiracy beliefs prospectively predicted a decreased likelihood of getting tested for corona; if tested, an increased likelihood of the test coming out positive; and, an increased likelihood of having violated corona regulations, deteriorated economic outcomes (job loss; reduced income), experiences of social rejection, and decreased overall well-being. Most of these effects generalized to a broader susceptibility to conspiracy theories (i.e. conspiracy mentality). Conclusions These findings suggest that conspiracy beliefs are associated with a myriad of negative life outcomes in the long run. Conspiracy beliefs predict how well people have coped with the pandemic over a period of eight months, as reflected in their health behavior, and their economic and social well-being.

Specifying a link between delayed gastric emptying and self-induced vomiting could offer new insights into the pathophysiology of purging disorder (PD). Methods Women (N = 95) recruited from the community meeting criteria for DSM-5 BN who purged (n = 26), BN with nonpurging compensatory behaviors (n = 18), PD (n = 25), or healthy control women (n = 26) completed assessments of gastric emptying, gut peptides, and subjective responses over the course of a standardized test meal under two conditions administered in a double-blind, crossover sequence: placebo and 10 mg of metoclopramide. Results Delayed gastric emptying was associated with purging with no main or moderating effects of binge eating in the placebo condition. Medication eliminated group differences in gastric emptying but did not alter group differences in reported gastrointestinal distress. Exploratory analyses revealed that medication caused increased postprandial PYY release, which predicted elevated gastrointestinal distress. Conclusions Delayed gastric emptying demonstrates a specific association with purging behaviors. However, correcting disruptions in gastric emptying may exacerbate disruptions in gut peptide responses specifically linked to the presence of purging after normal amounts of food.

To improve insights into these commonly co-occurring problems, we assessed the bidirectional association of sleep and 24-h activity rhythms with depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elderly persons. Methods In 1734 participants (mean age: 62.3 ± 9.3 years, 55% women) from the prospective Rotterdam Study, 24-h activity rhythms and sleep were estimated with actigraphy (mean duration: 146 ± 19.6 h), sleep quality with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale. Repeated measures were available for 947 participants (54%) over a median follow-up of 6 years (interquartile range = 5.6-6.3). Linear-mixed models were used to assess temporal associations of 24-h activity rhythms and sleep with depressive symptoms in both directions. Results High 24-h activity rhythm fragmentation (IV) (B = 1.002, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.641-1.363), long time in bed (TIB) (B = 0.111, 95% CI = 0.053-0.169), low sleep efficiency (SE) (B = -0.015, 95% CI = -0.020 to -0.009), long sleep onset latency (SOL) (B = 0.009, 95% CI = 0.006-0.012), and low self-rated sleep quality (B = 0.112, 95% CI = 0.0992-0.124) at baseline were associated with increasing depressive symptoms over time. Conversely, more depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with an increasing 24-h activity rhythm fragmentation (B = 0.002, 95% CI = 0.001-0.003) and TIB (B = 0.009, 95% CI = 0.004-0.015), and a decreasing SE (B = -0.140, 95% CI = -0.196 to -0.084), SOL (B = 0.013, 95% CI = 0.008-0.018), and self-rated sleep quality (B = 0.193, 95% CI = 0.171-0.215) over time.

The evaluation of racing thoughts relies on subjective reports, and objective measures are sparse. The current study aims at finding an objective neuropsychological equivalent of racing thoughts in a mixed group of BD patients and healthy controls by using a bistable perception paradigm. Method Eighty-three included participants formed three groups based on participants' levels of racing thoughts reported via the Racing and Crowded Thoughts Questionnaire. Participants reported reversals in their perception during viewing of the bistable Necker cube either spontaneously, while asked to focus on one interpretation of the cube, or while asked to accelerate perceptual reversals. The dynamics of perceptual alternations were studied both at a conscious level (with manual temporal windows reflecting perceptual reversals) and at a more automatic level (with ocular temporal windows derived from ocular fixations). Results The rate of windows was less modulated by attentional conditions in participants with racing thoughts, and most clearly so for ocular windows. The rate of ocular windows was especially high when participants with racing thoughts were asked to focus on one interpretation of the Necker cube and when they received these instructions for the first time. Conclusions Our results indicate that in subjects with racing thoughts automatic perceptual processes escape cognitive control mechanisms. Racing thoughts may involve not only conscious thought mechanisms but also more automatic processes.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Here, we test (1) whether these scores contribute to prediction over-and-above family history, (2) the extent to which PGS prediction reflects inherited genetic variation v. demography (population stratification and assortative mating) and indirect genetic effects of parents (genetic nurture), and (3) whether PGS prediction is mediated by behavioral disinhibition prior to substance use onset. Methods PGSs for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use/use disorder were calculated for Minnesota Twin Family Study participants (N = 2483, 1565 monozygotic/918 dizygotic). Twins' parents were assessed for histories of substance use disorder. Twins were assessed for behavioral disinhibition at age 11 and substance use from ages 14 to 24. PGS prediction of substance use was examined using linear mixed-effects, within-twin pair, and structural equation models. Results Nearly all PGS measures were associated with multiple types of substance use independently of family history. However, most within-pair PGS prediction estimates were substantially smaller than the corresponding between-pair estimates, suggesting that prediction is driven in part by demography and indirect genetic effects of parents. Path analyses indicated the effects of both PGSs and family history on substance use were mediated via disinhibition in preadolescence. Conclusions PGSs capturing risk of substance use and use disorder can be combined with family history measures to augment prediction of substance use outcomes. Results highlight indirect sources of genetic associations and preadolescent elevations in behavioral disinhibition as two routes through which these scores may relate to substance use.

Dimensional models of adversity purport that different types of adversity likely have distinct neurobiological consequences. Adolescence is a key developmental period, during which deviations from normative neurodevelopment may have particular relevance for mental health. However, longitudinal work examining links between different forms of maltreatment, neurodevelopment, and mental health is limited. Methods In the present study, we explored associations between abuse, neglect, and longitudinal development of within-network functional connectivity of the salience (SN), default mode (DMN), and executive control network in 142 community residing adolescents. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired at age 16 (T1; M = 16.46 years, s.d. = 0.52, 66F) and 19 (T2; mean follow-up period: 2.35 years). Mental health data were also collected at T1 and T2. Childhood maltreatment history was assessed prior to T1. Results Abuse and neglect were both found to be associated with increases in within-SN functional connectivity from age 16 to 19. Further, there were sex differences in the association between neglect and changes in within-DMN connectivity. Finally, increases in within-SN connectivity were found to mediate the association between abuse/neglect and lower problematic substance use and higher depressive symptoms at age 19. Conclusions Our findings suggest that childhood maltreatment is associated with altered neurodevelopmental trajectories, and that changes in salience processing may be linked with risk and resilience for the development of depression and substance use problems during adolescence, respectively. Further work is needed to understand the distinct neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes of abuse and neglect.  © The Author(s), 2021.

However, it is unknown whether massed prolonged exposure (MPE) is non-inferior to standard prolonged exposure (SPE) protocols in the long term. The current study aimed to assess whether MPE was non-inferior to SPE at 12 months post-treatment, and to ascertain changes in secondary measure outcomes. Methods A multi-site non-inferiority randomised controlled trial (RCT) compared SPE with MPE in 12 clinics. The primary outcome was PTSD symptom severity (CAPS-5) at 12 months post-treatment commencement. Secondary outcome measures included symptoms of depression, anxiety, anger, disability, and quality of life at 12 weeks and 12 months post-treatment commencement. Outcome assessors were blinded to treatment allocation. The intention-to-treat sample included 138 Australian military members and veterans and data were analysed for 134 participants (SPE = 71, MPE = 63). Results Reductions in PTSD severity were maintained at 12 months and MPE remained non-inferior to SPE. Both treatment groups experienced a reduction in depression, anxiety, anger, and improvements in quality of life at 12 weeks and 12 months post-treatment commencement. Treatment effects for self-reported disability in the SPE group at 12 weeks were not maintained, with neither group registering significant effects at 12 months. Conclusions The emergence of massed protocols for PTSD is an important advancement. The current study provides RCT evidence for the longevity of MPE treatment gains at 12 months post-treatment commencement and demonstrated non-inferiority to SPE. Promisingly, both treatments also significantly reduced the severity of comorbid symptoms commonly occurring alongside PTSD. © The Author(s), 2023.

Psychological interventions are the first-line treatment and, although a considerable number of randomized trials have been conducted, no recent comprehensive meta-analysis has evaluated treatment effects. Methods We used an existing database of randomized controlled trials of psychotherapies for adult depression and included studies aimed at perinatal depression. Random effects models were used in all analyses. We examined the effects of the interventions in the short and long term, and also examined secondary outcomes. Results Forty-three studies with 49 comparisons and 6270 participants between an intervention and control group were included. The overall effect size was g = 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45~0.89; numbers needed-to-be-treated = 4.39] with high heterogeneity (I2 = 80%; 95% CI 75~85). This effect size remained largely unchanged and significant in a series of sensitivity analyses, although some publication bias was found. The effects remained significant at 6-12 months follow-up. Significant effects were also found for social support, anxiety, functional limitations, parental stress and marital stress, although the number of studies for each outcome was low. All results should be considered with caution because of the high levels of heterogeneity in most analyses. Conclusions Psychological interventions are probably effective in the treatment of perinatal depression, with effects that last at least up to 6-12 months and probably also have effects on social support, anxiety, functional impairment, parental stress, and marital stress.

From direct interviews prior to (T1), and then in the same individuals after the pandemic onset (T2), we assessed the influence of personal psychiatric history on changes in symptoms and wellbeing. Methods Two hundred and four (19-69 years/117 female) individuals from a multigenerational family study were followed clinically up to T1. Psychiatric symptom changes (T1-to-T2), their association with lifetime psychiatric history (no, only-past, and recent psychiatric history), and pandemic-specific worries were investigated. Results At T2 relative to T1, participants with recent psychopathology (in the last 2 years) had significantly fewer depressive (mean, M = 41.7 v. 47.6) and traumatic symptoms (M = 6.6 v. 8.1, p < 0.001), while those with no and only-past psychiatric history had decreased wellbeing (M = 22.6 v. 25.0, p < 0.01). Three pandemic-related worry factors were identified: Illness/death, Financial, and Social isolation. Individuals with recent psychiatric history had greater Illness/death and Financial worries than the no/only-past groups, but these worries were unrelated to depression at T2. Among individuals with no/only-past history, Illness/death worries predicted increased T2 depression [B = 0.6(0.3), p < 0.05]. Conclusions As recent psychiatric history was not associated with increased depression or anxiety during the pandemic, new groups of previously unaffected persons might contribute to the increased pandemic-related depression and anxiety rates reported. These individuals likely represent incident cases that are first detected in primary care and other non-specialty clinical settings. Such settings may be useful for monitoring future illness among newly at-risk individuals. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Factors such as negative symptoms, effort-cost decision-making, cognition, and functional skills have all been associated with goal-directed behavior in schizophrenia as indexed by clinical interviews or laboratory-based tasks. However, little work has examined whether these factors relate to the real-world pursuit of goal-directed activities in this population. Methods This study aimed to fill this gap by using Ecological Momentary Assessment (four survey prompts per day for 1 week) to test hypotheses about symptom, effort allocation, cognitive, and functional measures associated with planned and completed goal-directed behavior in the daily lives of 63 individuals with schizophrenia. Results Individuals with schizophrenia completed more goal-directed activities than they planned [t(62) = -4.01, p < 0.001]. Motivation and pleasure (i.e. experiential) negative symptoms, controlling for depressive symptoms, negatively related to planned goal-directed behavior [odds ratio (OR) 0.92, p = 0.005]. Increased effort expenditure for high probability rewards (planned: OR 1.01, p = 0.034, completed: OR 1.01, p = 0.034) along with performance on a daily functional skills task (planned: OR 1.04, p = 0.002, completed: OR 1.03, p = 0.047) negatively related to both planned and completed goal-directed activity. Conclusions Our results present correlates of real-world goal-directed behavior that largely align with impaired ability to make future estimations in schizophrenia.

This study aimed to provide an estimate of the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for improving functioning in early psychosis. We also sought evidence of superiority between intervention approaches. Methods An electronic search was conducted using PubMed and PsycINFO to identify original articles reporting on trials of psychosocial interventions in early-stage psychosis, published up to December 2020 and is reported following PRISMA guidelines. Data were extracted on validated measures of functioning from included studies and pooled standardised mean difference (SMD) was estimated. Results In total, 31 studies involving 2811 participants were included, focusing on: cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis (CBTp), family-based therapy, supported employment, cognitive remediation training (CRT) and multi-component psychosocial interventions. Across interventions, improved function was observed (SMD = 0.239; 95% confidence interval 0.115-0.364, p < 0.001). Effect sizes varied by intervention type, stage of illness, length and duration of treatment and outcome measure used. In particular, interventions based on CRT significantly outperformed symptom-focused CBT interventions, while multi-component interventions were associated with largest gains. Conclusions Psychosocial interventions, particularly when provided as part of a multi-component intervention model and delivered in community-based settings are associated with significant improvements in social and occupational function. This review underscores the value of sensitively tracking and targeting psychosocial function as part of the standard provided by early intervention services.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

The use of endophenotypes may help clarify its aetiology. Measures from the smooth pursuit and antisaccade eye movement tasks have been identified as endophenotypes for schizophrenia in twin and family studies. However, the genetic basis of the overlap between schizophrenia and these oculomotor markers is largely unknown. Here, we tested whether schizophrenia polygenic risk scores (PRS) were associated with oculomotor performance in the general population. Methods Analyses were based on the data of 2956 participants (aged 30-95) of the Rhineland Study, a community-based cohort study in Bonn, Germany. Genotyping was performed on Omni-2.5 exome arrays. Using summary statistics from a recent meta-analysis based on the two largest schizophrenia genome-wide association studies to date, we quantified genetic risk for schizophrenia by creating PRS at different p value thresholds for genetic markers. We examined associations between PRS and oculomotor performance using multivariable regression models. Results Higher PRS were associated with higher antisaccade error rate and latency, and lower antisaccade amplitude gain. PRS showed inconsistent patterns of association with smooth pursuit velocity gain and were not associated with saccade rate during smooth pursuit or performance on a prosaccade control task. Conclusions There is an overlap between genetic determinants of schizophrenia and oculomotor endophenotypes. Our findings suggest that the mechanisms that underlie schizophrenia also affect oculomotor function in the general population.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Recently, peripheral acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) has been shown to be lower in patients with major depressive episodes (MDEs) than in controls. l-Carnitine is involved in mitochondrial function and ALC is its short-chain acetyl-ester. Our first aim was to compare the plasma levels of l-carnitine and ALC, and the l-carnitine/ALC ratio in patients with a current MDE and healthy controls (HCs). Our second aim was to assess their changes after antidepressant treatment. Methods l-Carnitine and ALC levels and the carnitine/ALC ratio were measured in 460 patients with an MDE in a context of MDD and in 893 HCs. Depressed patients were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months of antidepressant treatment for biology and clinical outcome. Results As compared to HC, depressed patients had lower ALC levels (p < 0.00001), higher l-carnitine levels (p < 0.00001) and higher l-carnitine/ALC ratios (p < 0.00001). ALC levels increased [coefficient: 0.18; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.24; p < 0.00001], and l-carnitine levels (coefficient: -0.58; 95% CI -0.75 to -0.41; p < 0.00001) and l-carnitine/ALC ratios (coefficient: -0.41; 95% CI -0.47 to -0.34; p < 0.00001), decreased after treatment. These parameters were completely restored after 6 months of antidepressant. Moreover, the baseline l-carnitine/ALC ratio predicted remission after 3 months of treatment (odds ratio = 1.14; 95% CI 1.03-1.27; p = 0.015). Conclusions Our data suggest a decreased mitochondrial metabolism of l-carnitine into ALC during MDE. This decreased mitochondrial metabolism is restored after a 6-month antidepressant treatment. Moreover, the magnitude of mitochondrial dysfunction may predict remission after 3 months of antidepressant treatment. New strategies targeting mitochondria should be explored to improve treatments of MDD. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Understanding the neural correlates of suicide ideation (SI) in children is crucial to ongoing efforts to understand and prevent youth suicide. This study characterized key neural networks during rest and emotion task conditions in an epidemiologically informed sample of children who report current, past, or no SI. Methods Data are from the adolescent brain cognitive development study, including 8248 children (ages 9-10; mean age = 119.2 months; 49.2% female) recruited from the community. Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and activation to emotional stimuli in the salience (SN) and default mode (DMN) networks were measured through fMRI. Self-reported SI and clinical profiles were gathered. We examined the replicability of our model results through repeated sub-sample reliability analyses. Results Children with current SI (2.0%), compared to those without any past SI, showed lower DMN RSFC (B = -0.267, p < 0.001) and lower DMN activation in response to negative as compared to neutral faces (B = -0.204, p = 0.010). These results were robust to the effects of MDD, ADHD, and medication use. Sub-sample analysis further supported the robustness of these results. We did not find support for differences in SN RSFC or in SN activation to positive or negative stimuli for children with or without SI. Conclusions Results from a large brain imaging study using robust statistical approaches suggest aberrant DMN functioning in children with current suicide ideation. Findings suggest potential mechanisms that may be targeted in suicide prevention efforts.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We therefore aimed to compare the neural responses during voluntary down-regulation of negative emotions in a large functional magnetic resonance imaging study of BD, patients' unaffected first-degree relatives (URs), and healthy controls (HCs). Methods We compared neural activity and fronto-limbic functional connectivity during emotion regulation in response to aversive v. neutral pictures in patients recently diagnosed with BD (n = 78) in full/partial remission, their URs (n = 35), and HCs (n = 56). Results Patients showed hypo-activity in the left dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (DMPFC and DLPFC) during emotion regulation while viewing aversive pictures compared to HCs, with URs displaying intermediate neural activity in these regions. There were no significant differences between patients with BD and HCs in functional connectivity from the amygdala during emotion regulation. However, exploratory analysis indicated that URs displayed more negative amygdala-DMPFC coupling compared with HCs and more negative amygdala-cingulate DLPFC coupling compared to patients with BD. At a behavioral level, patients and their URs were less able to dampen negative emotions in response aversive pictures. Conclusions The findings point to deficient recruitment of prefrontal resources and more negative fronto-amygdala coupling as neural markers of impaired emotion regulation in recently diagnosed remitted patients with BD and their URs, respectively.  © The Author(s), 2021.

As PLEs have been related to alterations in both white matter and cognition, we investigated whether cognition (g-factor and processing speed) mediates the relationship between white matter and PLEs. Methods We investigated two independent samples (6170 and 19 891) from the UK Biobank, through path analysis. For both samples, measures of whole-brain fractional anisotropy (gFA) and mean diffusivity (gMD), as indications of white matter microstructure, were derived from probabilistic tractography. For the smaller sample, variables whole-brain white matter network efficiency and microstructure were also derived from structural connectome data. Results The mediation of cognition on the relationships between white matter properties and PLEs was non-significant. However, lower gFA was associated with having PLEs in combination with distress in the full available sample (standardized β = -0.053, p = 0.011). Additionally, lower gFA/higher gMD was associated with lower g-factor (standardized β = 0.049, p < 0.001; standardized β = -0.027, p = 0.003), and partially mediated by processing speed with a proportion mediated of 7% (p = < 0.001) for gFA and 11% (p < 0.001) for gMD. Conclusions We show that lower global white matter microstructure is associated with having PLEs in combination with distress, which suggests a direction of future research that could help clarify how and why individuals progress from subclinical to clinical psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, we replicated that processing speed mediates the relationship between white matter microstructure and g-factor. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS) produce principal evidence for the association of genetic variants with disease. Transcriptomic imputation (TI) allows for the translation of those variants into regulatory mechanisms, which can then be used to assess the functional outcome of genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) in a broader setting through the use of phenome-wide association studies (pheWASs) in large and diverse clinical biobank populations with electronic health record phenotypes. Methods Here, we applied TI using S-PrediXcan to translate the most recent PGC-ED AN GWAS findings into AN-GReX. For significant genes, we imputed AN-GReX in the Mount Sinai BioMe™ Biobank and performed pheWASs on over 2000 outcomes to test the clinical consequences of aberrant expression of these genes. We performed a secondary analysis to assess the impact of body mass index (BMI) and sex on AN-GReX clinical associations. Results Our S-PrediXcan analysis identified 53 genes associated with AN, including what is, to our knowledge, the first-genetic association of AN with the major histocompatibility complex. AN-GReX was associated with autoimmune, metabolic, and gastrointestinal diagnoses in our biobank cohort, as well as measures of cholesterol, medications, substance use, and pain. Additionally, our analyses showed moderation of AN-GReX associations with measures of cholesterol and substance use by BMI, and moderation of AN-GReX associations with celiac disease by sex. Conclusions Our BMI-stratified results provide potential avenues of functional mechanism for AN-genes to investigate further. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

Estrogen is thought to contribute to sex differences in these disorders, and reduced estrogen is also known to be a key driver of menopause symptoms such as hot flashes. Moreover, estrogen is used to treat menopause symptoms. In order to test for potential shared genetic influences between menopause symptoms and psychiatric disorders, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of estrogen medication use (as a proxy for menopause symptoms) in the UK Biobank. Methods The analysis included 232 993 women aged 39-71 in the UK Biobank. The outcome variable for genetic analyses was estrogen medication use, excluding women using hormonal contraceptives. Trans-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses were conducted along with genetic correlation analyses on the European ancestry GWAS results. Hormone usage was also tested for association with depression and PTSD. Results GWAS of estrogen medication use (compared to non-use) identified a locus in the TACR3 gene, which was previously linked to hot flashes in menopause [top rs77322567, odds ratio (OR) = 0.78, p = 7.7 × 10-15]. Genetic correlation analyses revealed shared genetic influences on menopause symptoms and depression (rg = 0.231, s.e. = 0.055, p = 2.8 × 10-5). Non-genetic analyses revealed higher psychiatric symptoms scores among women using estrogen medications. Conclusions These results suggest that menopause symptoms have a complex genetic etiology which is partially shared with genetic influences on depression. Moreover, the TACR3 gene identified here has direct clinical relevance; antagonists for the neurokinin 3 receptor (coded for by TACR3) are effective treatments for hot flashes.

Methods Data were pooled from two intergenerational cohort studies: the Australian Temperament Project Generation 3 Study (395 mothers, 691 pregnancies) and the Victorian Intergenerational Health Cohort Study (398 mothers, 609 pregnancies). Alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use were assessed in adolescence (13-18 years), young adulthood (19-29 years) and at ages 29-35 years for those transitioning to parenthood. Exposures were weekly or more frequent preconception binge drinking (5 + drinks in one session), tobacco use and cannabis use. Outcomes were any alcohol, tobacco and cannabis use prior to awareness of the pregnancy, after awareness of pregnancy (up to and including the third trimester pregnancy) and at 1 year postpartum. Results Frequent preconception binge drinking, tobacco use and cannabis use across both adolescence and young adulthood were strong predictors of continued use post-conception, before and after awareness of the pregnancy and at 1 year postpartum. Substance use limited to young adulthood also predicted continued use post-conception. Conclusions Persistent alcohol, tobacco use and cannabis use that starts in adolescence has a strong continuity into parenthood. Reducing substance use in the perinatal period requires action well before pregnancy, commencing in adolescence and continuing into the years before conception and throughout the perinatal period.

The majority of research in the field has explored this issue by examining gender differences in global grief severity. Findings have been mixed. In this study, we explore potential gender differences in grief using network analysis. This approach examines how individual symptoms relate to and reinforce each other, and so offers potential to shed light on novel aspects of grief expression across genders. Method Graphical lasso networks were constructed using self-report data from 839 spousally bereaved older participants (584 female, 255 male) collected at 2- and 11- months post-bereavement. Edge strength, node strength and global network strength were compared to identify similarities and differences between gender networks across time. Results At both time points, the strongest connection for both genders was from yearning to pangs of grief. Yearning, pangs of grief, acceptance, bitterness and shock were prominent nodes at time 1. Numbness and meaninglessness emerged as prominent nodes at time 2. Males and females differed in the relative importance of shock at time 1, and the female network had greater overall strength than the male network at time 2. Conclusions This study identified many similarities and few differences in the relationships between prolonged grief symptoms for males and females.

This study investigated the sex-specific risk profiles for suicide among the bipolar disorder population in terms of incidence, healthcare utilization and comorbidity. Methods Using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2016, this nationwide cohort study included patients with bipolar disorder (N = 46 490) and individuals representative of the general population (N = 185 960) matched by age and sex at a 1:4 ratio. Mortality rate ratios (MRRs) of suicide were calculated between suicide rates of bipolar disorder cohort and general population. In addition, a nested case-control study (1428 cases died by suicide and 5710 living controls) was conducted in the bipolar disorder cohort to examine the sex-specific risk of healthcare utilization and comorbidities. Results Suicide risk was considerably higher in the cohort (MRR = 21.9) than in the general population, especially among women (MRR = 35.6). Sex-stratified analyses revealed distinct healthcare utilization patterns and physical comorbidity risk profiles between the sexes. Although female patients who died by suicide had higher risks of nonhypertensive cardiovascular disease, pneumonia, chronic kidney disease, peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome, and sepsis compared to their living counterparts, male patients who died by suicide had higher risks of chronic kidney disease and sepsis compared to the living controls. Conclusions Patients with bipolar disorder who died by suicide had sex-specific risk profiles in incidence and physical comorbidities. Identifying these modifiable risk factors may guide interventions for suicide risk reduction.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

The hippocampus may be particularly sensitive to substance exposure. This remains largely untested in humans and familial risk may confound exposure effects. We extend prior work on alcohol and hippocampal volume in women by testing common and unique substance use effects and the potential moderating role of sex on hippocampal volume during emerging adulthood. A quasi-experimental cotwin control (CTC) design was used to separate familial risk from exposure consequences. Methods In a population-based sample of 435 24-year-old same-sex twins (58% women), dimensional measures (e.g. frequency, amount) of alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine use across emerging adulthood were assessed. Hippocampal volume was assessed using MRI. Results Greater substance use was significantly associated with lower hippocampal volume for women but not men. The same pattern was observed for alcohol, cannabis, and nicotine. CTC analyses provided evidence that hippocampal effects likely reflected familial risk and the consequence of substance use in general and alcohol and nicotine in particular; cannabis effects were in the expected direction but not significant. Within-pair mediation analyses suggested that the effect of alcohol use on the hippocampus may reflect, in part, comorbid nicotine use. Conclusions The observed hippocampal volume deviations in women likely reflected substance-related premorbid familial risk and the consequences of smoking and, to a lesser degree, drinking. Findings contribute to a growing body of work suggesting heightened risk among women toward experiencing deleterious effects of substance exposure on the still-developing young adult hippocampus.

Results are reported on frequency of ADM use, reasons for use, and perceived effectiveness of use in general population surveys across 20 countries. Methods Face-to-face interviews with community samples totaling n = 49 919 respondents in the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys asked about ADM use anytime in the prior 12 months in conjunction with validated fully structured diagnostic interviews. Treatment questions were administered independently of diagnoses and asked of all respondents. Results 3.1% of respondents reported ADM use within the past 12 months. In high-income countries (HICs), depression (49.2%) and anxiety (36.4%) were the most common reasons for use. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), depression (38.4%) and sleep problems (31.9%) were the most common reasons for use. Prevalence of use was 2-4 times as high in HICs as LMICs across all examined diagnoses. Newer ADMs were proportionally used more often in HICs than LMICs. Across all conditions, ADMs were reported as very effective by 58.8% of users and somewhat effective by an additional 28.3% of users, with both proportions higher in LMICs than HICs. Neither ADM class nor reason for use was a significant predictor of perceived effectiveness. Conclusion ADMs are in widespread use and for a variety of conditions including but going beyond depression and anxiety. In a general population sample from multiple LMICs and HICs, ADMs were widely perceived to be either very or somewhat effective by the people who use them.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

ISAcog is associated with poorer long-term outcome in other diseases. This study examines ISAcog in PD with and without mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), compared to healthy controls, and its clinical-behavioral and neuroimaging correlates. Methods We examined 63 PD patients and 30 age- and education-matched healthy controls. Cognitive state was examined following the Movement Disorder Society Level II criteria. ISAcog was determined by subtracting z-scores (based on controls' scores) of objective tests and subjective questionnaires. Neural correlates were assessed by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in 47 patients (43 with MRI) and 11 controls. We analyzed whole-brain glucose metabolism and cortical thickness in regions where FDG-uptake correlated with ISAcog. Results PD-MCI patients (N = 23) showed significantly more ISAcog than controls and patients without MCI (N = 40). When all patients who underwent FDG-PET were examined, metabolism in the bilateral superior medial frontal gyrus, anterior and midcingulate cortex negatively correlated with ISAcog (FWE-corrected p < 0.001). In PD-MCI, ISAcog was related to decreased metabolism in the right superior temporal lobe and insula (N = 13; FWE-corrected p = 0.023) as well as the midcingulate cortex (FWE-corrected p = 0.002). Cortical thickness was not associated with ISAcog in these regions. No significant correlations were found between ISAcog and glucose metabolism in controls and patients without MCI. Conclusions Similar to Alzheimer's disease, the cingulate cortex seems to be relevant in ISAcog in PD. In PD-MCI patients, ISAcog might result from a disrupted network that regulates awareness of cognition and error processes.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

We aimed to use machine learning to characterise its ability to predict depression remission. Methods Data were obtained from 81 15- to 25-year-olds with a major depressive disorder who had participated in the YoDA-C trial, in which they had been randomised to receive cognitive behavioural therapy plus either fluoxetine or placebo. Prior to commencing treatment patients performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task to assess rACC suppression. Support vector machines were trained on the fMRI data using nested cross-validation, and were similarly trained on clinical data. We further tested our fMRI model on data from the YoDA-A trial, in which participants had completed the same fMRI paradigm. Results Thirty-six of 81 (44%) participants in the YoDA-C trial achieved remission. Our fMRI model was able to predict remission status (AUC = 0.777 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.638-0.916], balanced accuracy = 67%, negative predictive value = 74%, p < 0.0001). Clinical models failed to predict remission status at better than chance levels. Testing the model on the alternative YoDA-A dataset confirmed its ability to predict remission (AUC = 0.776, balanced accuracy = 64%, negative predictive value = 70%, p < 0.0001). Conclusions We confirm that rACC activity acts as a prognostic biomarker for depression. The machine learning model can identify patients who are likely to have difficult-to-treat depression, which might direct the earlier provision of enhanced support and more intensive therapies.

The current study investigated how PTSD diagnosis and symptom severity, depressive symptoms, and childhood trauma uniquely relate to diurnal neuroendocrine secretion (cortisol and alpha-amylase rhythms) in women who recently experienced interpersonal trauma compared to non-traumatized controls (NTCs). Method Using a longitudinal design, we examined diurnal cortisol and alpha-amylase rhythms in 98 young women (n = 57 exposed to recent interpersonal trauma, n = 41 NTCs). Participants provided saliva samples and completed symptom measures at baseline and 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. Results Multilevel models (MLMs) revealed lower waking cortisol predicted the development of PTSD in trauma survivors and distinguished at-risk women from NTCs. Women with greater childhood trauma exposure exhibited flatter diurnal cortisol slopes. Among trauma-exposed individuals, lower waking cortisol levels were associated with higher concurrent PTSD symptom severity. Regarding alpha-amylase, MLMs revealed women with greater childhood trauma exposure exhibited higher waking alpha-amylase and slower diurnal alpha-amylase increase. Conclusions Results suggest lower waking cortisol in the acute aftermath of trauma may be implicated in PTSD onset and maintenance. Findings also suggest childhood trauma may predict a different pattern of dysfunction in stress response systems following subsequent trauma exposure than the stress system dynamics associated with PTSD risk; childhood trauma appears to be associated with flattened diurnal cortisol and alpha-amylase slopes, as well as higher waking alpha-amylase.

Yet, their interrelationships have remained elusive. The aim of this study was to examine the multi-cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between (change in) smoking and alcohol use and (change in) number of depressive symptoms. Methods In this prospective, longitudinal study, 6646 adults from the general population were included with follow-up measurements after 3 and 6 years. Linear mixed-effects models were used to test multi-cross-sectional and longitudinal associations, with smoking behaviour, alcohol use and genetic risk scores for smoking and alcohol use as independent variables and depressive symptoms as dependent variables. Results In the multi-cross-sectional analysis, smoking status and number of cigarettes per day were positively associated with depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). Moderate drinking was associated with less symptoms of depression compared to non-use (p = 0.011). Longitudinally, decreases in the numbers of cigarettes per day and alcoholic drinks per week as well as alcohol cessation were associated with a reduction of depressive symptoms (p = 0.001-0.028). Results of genetic risk score analyses aligned with these findings. Conclusions While cross-sectionally smoking and moderate alcohol use show opposing associations with depressive symptoms, decreases in smoking behaviour as well as alcohol consumption are associated with improvements in depressive symptoms over time. Although we cannot infer causality, these results open avenues to further investigate interventions targeting smoking and alcohol behaviours in people suffering from depressive symptoms.  © The Author(s), 2021.

This paper aims to examine the effectiveness of EI on functioning and symptomatic improvement in adult-onset psychosis, and the optimal duration of the intervention. Methods 360 psychosis patients aged 26-55 years were randomized to receive either standard care (SC, n = 120), or case management for two (2-year EI, n = 120) or 4 years (4-year EI, n = 120) in a 4-year rater-masked, parallel-group, superiority, randomized controlled trial of treatment effectiveness (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00919620). Primary (i.e. social and occupational functioning) and secondary outcomes (i.e. positive and negative symptoms, and quality of life) were assessed at baseline, 6-month, and yearly for 4 years. Results Compared with SC, patients with 4-year EI had better Role Functioning Scale (RFS) immediate [interaction estimate = 0.008, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.001-0.014, p = 0.02] and extended social network (interaction estimate = 0.011, 95% CI = 0.004-0.018, p = 0.003) scores. Specifically, these improvements were observed in the first 2 years. Compared with the 2-year EI group, the 4-year EI group had better RFS total (p = 0.01), immediate (p = 0.01), and extended social network (p = 0.05) scores at the fourth year. Meanwhile, the 4-year (p = 0.02) and 2-year EI (p = 0.004) group had less severe symptoms than the SC group at the first year. Conclusions Specialized EI treatment for psychosis patients aged 26-55 should be provided for at least the initial 2 years of illness. Further treatment up to 4 years confers little benefits in this age range over the course of the study.  Copyright © University of Hong Kong, 2022.

In this longitudinal study, we compare symptom trajectories and remission over the first 2 years of treatment in FEP with and without CIT and examine if differences are linked to the use of antipsychotics. Methods FEP (N = 191) were recruited from in- and outpatient services 1997-2000, and assessed at baseline, 3 months, 1 and 2 years. Inclusion criteria were 15-65 years, actively psychotic with a DSM-IV diagnosis of psychotic disorder and no previous adequate treatment for psychosis. Antipsychotic medication is reported as defined daily dosage (DDD). CIT (<18) was assessed with the Brief Betrayal Trauma Survey, and symptomatic remission based on scores from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Results CIT (n = 63, 33%) was not associated with symptomatic remission at 2 years follow-up (71% in remission, 14% in relapse), or time to first remission (CIT 12/ no-CIT 9 weeks, p = 0.51). Those with CIT had significantly more severe positive, depressive, and excited symptoms. FEP with physical (N = 39, 20%) or emotional abuse (N = 22, 14, 7%) had higher DDD at 1 year (p < 0.05). Mean DDD did not excerpt a significant between-group effect on symptom trajectories of positive symptoms. Conclusion Results indicate that antipsychotic medication is equally beneficial in the achievement of symptomatic remission in FEP after 2 years independent of CIT. Still, FEP patients with CIT had more severe positive, depressive, and excited symptoms throughout.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

There have been few direct comparisons of CPT and PE intended to determine their comparative effectiveness, none of which have examined outcomes among military veterans receiving these treatments in a residential setting such as the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) residential rehabilitation treatment programs (RRTPs). Such work is essential given that these veterans are among the most complex and severely symptomatic patients with PTSD treated in VA. In this study we compared changes in PTSD and depressive symptoms across admission, discharge, four months and 12 months following discharge among veterans who received CPT or PE within VA RRTPs. Methods Using linear mixed models conducted on program evaluation data derived from the electronic medical record and follow-up surveys, we compared self-reported PTSD and depressive symptom outcomes among 1130 veterans with PTSD who were treated with individual CPT (n = 832, 73.5%) or PE (n = 297, 26.5%) in VA PTSD RRTPs in fiscal years 2018-2020. Results PTSD and depressive symptom severity did not significantly differ at any time points. The CPT and PE groups both showed large-sized reductions in PTSD (CPT d = 1.41, PE d = 1.51) and depression (CPT d = 1.01, PE d = 1.09) from baseline to 12-month follow-up. Conclusions Outcomes for PE and CPT do not differ among a highly complex population of veterans with severe PTSD and several comorbid conditions that can make it difficult to engage in treatment.

As cognitive processes and psychotic symptoms are both known to be sensitive to stress, the present study investigated the exact associations between stress, adapting of beliefs [reversal learning (RL), bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE), and jumping to conclusions (JTC)] and paranoia. We hypothesized that paranoia would increase under stress and that difficulties in adapting of beliefs would mediate or moderate the link between stress and paranoia. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the investigated effects would be strongest in the group of individuals diagnosed with a psychotic disorder. Methods We exposed 155 participants (38 diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, 40 individuals with attenuated psychotic symptoms, 39 clinical controls diagnosed with an obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 38 healthy controls) to a control condition and a stress condition, in which we assessed their levels of paranoia and their ability to adapt beliefs. We applied multilevel models to analyze the data. Results Paranoia was higher in the stress condition than in the control condition, b = 1.142, s.e. = 0.338, t(150) = 3.381, p < 0.001. RL, BADE, and JTC did not differ between conditions and did not mediate or moderate the association between stress and paranoia (all ps > 0.05). Conclusions The results support the assumption that stress triggers paranoia. However, the link between stress and paranoia does not seem to be affected by the ability to adapt beliefs.

However, prior studies largely focused on individual SDoH and thus less is known about the relative importance (RI) of SDoH variables, especially in older adults. Given that risk factors for MDD may differ across the lifespan, we aimed to identify the SDoH that was most strongly related to newly diagnosed MDD in a cohort of older adults. Methods We used self-reported health-related survey data from 41 174 older adults (50-89 years, median age = 67 years) who participated in the Mayo Clinic Biobank, and linked ICD codes for MDD in the participants' electronic health records. Participants with a history of clinically documented or self-reported MDD prior to survey completion were excluded from analysis (N = 10 938, 27%). We used Cox proportional hazards models with a gradient boosting machine approach to quantify the RI of 30 pre-selected SDoH variables on the risk of future MDD diagnosis. Results Following biobank enrollment, 2073 older participants were diagnosed with MDD during the follow-up period (median duration = 6.7 years). The most influential SDoH was perceived level of social activity (RI = 0.17). Lower level of social activity was associated with a higher risk of MDD [hazard ratio = 2.27 (95% CI 2.00-2.50) for highest v. lowest level]. Conclusion Across a range of SDoH variables, perceived level of social activity is most strongly related to MDD in older adults. Monitoring changes in the level of social activity may help identify older adults at an increased risk of MDD. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

We examine its potential genetic heterogeneity as a function of sex, age, clinical features and mode of ascertainment. Methods In the Swedish population born 1932-1995 (n = 5 829 952), we examined the genetic risk profiles for AUD, major depression (MD), anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, drug use disorder (DUD), attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and criminal behavior (CB) in 361 124 cases of AUD subdivided by sex, age at onset (AAO), recurrence, mode of ascertainment and medical complications. Family genetic risk scores (FGRS), calculated from 1st to 5th-degree relatives controlling of cohabitation, assesses genetic risk from phenotypes in the family, not from DNA variants. Results FGRS profiles differed modestly across sex with all scores higher in females. Differences were more pronounced for AAO and recurrence with the FGRS for AUD, DUD, ADHD and CB substantially higher in cases with early AAO or high recurrence rates. Genetic profiles differed considerably by mode of ascertainment, with higher FGRS for AUD and most other disorders in patients seen in hospital v. primary care settings. Cases of AUD with medical complications had higher FGRS for AUD. AUD cases comorbid with MD and DUD had higher FGRS risk for AUD, but this genetic may be less specific given increases in FGRS for multiple other disorders. Conclusions From a genetic perspective, AUD differs substantially as a function of AAO, recurrence, mode of ascertainment and patterns of comorbidity, suggesting caution in cross-sample comparisons of AUD cohorts that differ in these features.

To understand the potential of either neuropeptide as a pharmacological treatment for individuals with impairments in social cognition, it is important to demonstrate the beneficial effects of OT and AVP on mentalizing in healthy individuals. Methods In the present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n = 186) of healthy individuals, we examined the effects of OT and AVP administration on behavioral responses and neural activity in response to a mentalizing task. Results Relative to placebo, neither drug showed an effect on task reaction time or accuracy, nor on whole-brain neural activation or functional connectivity observed within brain networks associated with mentalizing. Exploratory analyses included several variables previously shown to moderate OT's effects on social processes (e.g., self-reported empathy, alexithymia) but resulted in no significant interaction effects. Conclusions Results add to a growing literature demonstrating that intranasal administration of OT and AVP may have a more limited effect on social cognition, at both the behavioral and neural level, than initially assumed.

Methods We present a secondary analysis of two nationally representative British birth cohorts, the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS) and 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). We used latent variable mixture models to identify pre-pandemic longitudinal trajectories of psychological distress and a modified Poisson model with robust standard errors to estimate associations with psychological distress, life satisfaction and loneliness at different points during the pandemic. Results Our analysis identified five distinct pre-pandemic trajectories of psychological distress in both cohorts. All trajectories with prior symptoms of psychological distress irrespective of age of onset, severity and chronicity were associated with a greater relative risk of poorer mental health outcomes during the pandemic and the probability of poorer mental health associated with psychological distress trajectories remained fairly constant. The relationship was not fully attenuated when most recent pre-pandemic psychological distress and other midlife factors were controlled for. Conclusions Whilst life-course trajectories with any prior symptoms of psychological distress put individuals at greater risk of poor mental health outcomes during the pandemic, those with chronic and more recent occurrences were at highest risk. In addition, prior poor mental health during the adult life-course may mean individuals are less resilient to shocks, such as pandemics. Our findings show the importance of considering heterogeneous mental health trajectories across the life-course in the general population in addition to population average trends.

Methods In total, 7164 individual twins (84.12% complete pairs; 59.81% female; mean age = 30.58 years) from the Australian Twin Registry reported their lifetime misuse of prescription opioids, stimulants, and sedatives, and lifetime use of heroin, cannabis, cocaine/crack, illicit stimulants, hallucinogens, inhalants, solvents, and dissociatives via telephone interview. Independent pathway models (IPMs) and common pathway models (CPMs) partitioned the variance of drug use phenotypes into general and drug-specific genetic (a), common environmental (c), and unique environmental factors (e). Results An IPM with one general a and one general e factor and a one-factor CPM provided comparable fit to the data. General factors accounted for 55% (a = 14%, e = 41%) and 79% (a = 64%, e = 15%) of the respective variation in POM and heroin use in the IPM, and 25% (a = 12%, c = 8%, e = 5%) and 80% (a = 38%, c = 27%, e = 15%) of the respective variation in POM and heroin use in the CPM. Across both models, POM emerged with substantial drug-specific genetic influence (26-39% of total phenotypic variance; 69-74% of genetic variance); heroin use did not (0% of total phenotypic variance; 0% of genetic variance in both models). Prescription sedative misuse also demonstrated significant drug-specific genetic variance. Conclusions Genetic variation in POM, but not heroin use, is predominantly drug-specific. Misuse of prescription medications that reduce experiences of subjective distress may be partially influenced by sources of genetic variation separate from illicit drug use.

One candidate RDoC indicator is delay discounting (DD), a behavioral economic measure of impulsivity, based predominantly on studies examining DD and individual conditions. The current study sought to evaluate the transdiagnostic significance of DD in relation to several psychiatric conditions concurrently. Methods Participants were 1388 community adults (18-65) who completed an in-person assessment, including measures of DD, substance use, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Relations between DD and psychopathology were examined with three strategies: first, examining differences by individual condition using clinical cut-offs; second, examining DD in relation to latent psychopathology variables via principal components analysis (PCA); and third, examining DD and all psychopathology simultaneously via structural equation modeling (SEM). Results Individual analyses revealed elevations in DD were present in participants screening positive for multiple substance use disorders (tobacco, cannabis, and drug use disorder), ADHD, major depressive disorder (MDD), and an anxiety disorder (ps < 0.05-0.001). The PCA produced two latent components (substance involvement v. the other mental health indicators) and DD was significantly associated with both (ps < 0.001). In the SEM, unique significant positive associations were observed between the DD latent variable and tobacco, cannabis, and MDD (ps < 0.05-0.001). Conclusions These results provide some support for DD as a transdiagnostic indicator, but also suggest that studies of individual syndromes may include confounding via comorbidities. Further systematic investigation of DD as an RDoC indicator is warranted.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Even less is known about whether child maltreatment and major depressive disorder (MDD) impact different well-being constructs. This study aims to examine whether maltreated or depressed individuals have specific impacts on well-being structures. Methods Data analyzed were from the Montreal South-West Longitudinal Catchment Area Study (N = 1380). The potential confounding of age and sex was controlled by propensity score matching. We used network analysis to assess the impact of maltreatment and MDD on well-being. The centrality of nodes was estimated with the 'strength' index and a case-dropping bootstrap procedure was used to test network stability. Differences in the structure and connectivity of networks between different studied groups were also examined. Results Autonomy and daily life and social relations were the most central nodes for the MDD and maltreated groups [MDD group: strength coefficient (SC)autonomy = 1.50; SCdaily life and social relations = 1.34; maltreated group: SCautonomy = 1.69; SCdaily life and social relations = 1.55]. Both maltreatment and MDD groups had statistical differences in terms of the global strength of interconnectivity in their networks. Network invariance differed between with and without MDD groups indicating different structures of their networks. The non-maltreatment and MDD group had the highest level of overall connectivity. Conclusions We discovered distinct connectivity patterns of well-being outcomes in maltreatment and MDD groups. The identified core constructs could serve as potential targets to maximize the effectiveness of clinical management of MDD and also advance prevention to minimize the sequelae of maltreatment.

Thus, we tested whether the evidence that a transdiagnostic eating disorder treatment reduces responsivity of brain valuation regions to thin models and high-calorie binge foods, the intervention targets, from a smaller earlier trial emerged when we recruited additional participants. Methods Women with DSM-5 eating disorders (N = 138) were randomized to the dissonance-based body project treatment (BPT) or a waitlist control condition and completed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans assessing neural response to thin models and high-calorie foods at pretest and posttest. Results BPT v. control participants showed significantly greater reductions in responsivity of regions implicated in reward valuation (caudate) and attentional motivation (precuneus) to thin v. average-weight models, echoing findings from the smaller sample. Data from this larger sample also provided novel evidence that BPT v. control participants showed greater reductions in responsivity of regions implicated in reward valuation (ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) and food craving (hippocampus) to high-calorie binge foods v. low-calorie foods, as well as significantly greater reductions in eating disorder symptoms, abstinence from binge eating and purging behaviors, palatability ratings for high calorie foods, monetary value for high-calorie binge foods, and significantly greater increases in attractiveness ratings of average weight models. Conclusions Results from this larger sample provide evidence that BPT reduces valuation of the thin ideal and high-calorie binge foods, the intervention targets, per objective brain imaging data, and produces clinically meaningful reductions in eating pathology.

In this observational population-based cohort study, we examined longitudinal changes in psychological distress associated with testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods Participants (N = 8002; observations = 139 035) were drawn from 23 waves of the Understanding America Study, a nationally representative probability-based online panel of American adults followed-up every 2 weeks from 1 April 2020 to 15 February 2021. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. Results Over the course of the study, 576 participants reported testing positive for COVID-19. Using regression analysis including individual and time-fixed effects we found that psychological distress increased by 0.29 standard deviations (p < 0.001) during the 2-week period when participants first tested positive for COVID-19. Distress levels remained significantly elevated (d = 0.16, p < 0.01) for a further 2 weeks, before returning to baseline levels. Coronavirus symptom severity explained changes in distress attributable to COVID-19, whereby distress was more pronounced among those whose symptoms were more severe and were slower to subside. Conclusions This study indicates that testing positive for COVID-19 is associated with an initial increase in psychological distress that diminishes quickly as symptoms subside. Although COVID-19 may not produce lasting psychological distress among the majority of the general population it remains possible that a minority may suffer longer-term mental health consequences.  © The Author(s), 2021.

This study reports on the development and validation of a self-report measure of pandemic paranoia; that is, heightened levels of suspicion and mistrust towards others due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An international consortium developed an initial set of 28 items for the Pandemic Paranoia Scale (PPS), which were completed by participants from the UK (n = 512), USA (n = 535), Germany (n = 516), Hong Kong (n = 454) and Australia (n = 502) using stratified quota sampling (for age, sex and educational attainment) through Qualtrics and translated for Germany and Hong Kong. Results Exploratory factor analysis in the UK sample suggested a 25-item, three-factor solution (persecutory threat; paranoid conspiracy and interpersonal mistrust). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the remaining combined sample showed sufficient model fit in this independent set of data. Measurement invariance analyses suggested configural and metric invariance, but no scalar invariance across cultures/languages. A second-order factor CFA on the whole sample indicated that the three factors showed large loadings on a common second-order pandemic paranoia factor. Analyses also supported the test-retest reliability and internal and convergent validity. Conclusion The PPS offers an internationally validated and reliable method for assessing paranoia in the context of a pandemic. The PPS has the potential to enhance our understanding of the impact of the pandemic, the nature of paranoia and to assist in identifying and supporting people affected by pandemic-specific paranoia.

Methods A probability-based sample (N = 1751) of the US population age 20 and over was followed prospectively from February 2019 (T1), with subsequent interviews in May 2020 (T2) and August 2020 (T3). Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess prospective relationships between T1 SPD with experiences of disruption of employment, health care, and childcare at T2. Binary logistic regression was then used to assess relationships of T1 SPD, and socioeconomic status and T2 pandemic-related stressors with T3 SPD. Results At T1, SPD was associated with age, race/ethnicity, and household income. SPD at T1 predicted disruption of employment (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.4-3.8) and health care (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.1) at T2. SPD at T1 (OR 10.2, 95% CI 4.5-23.3), low household income at T1 (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1-6.4), disruption of employment at T2 (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.4-7.6), and disruption of healthcare at T2 (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5-7.2) were all significantly associated with elevated risk for SPD at T3. Conclusions Elevated risk for SPD during the COVID-19 pandemic is related to multiple psychological and social pathways that are likely to interact over the life course. Policies and interventions that target individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions as well as those experiencing persistent unemployment should be high priorities in the mental health response to the pandemic.

Methods A confirmatory factor analysis was carried out on a white British group in order to establish an adequate measurement model. Secondly, a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was conducted in order to assess measurement invariance. A sensitivity analysis comparing summated and latent means across groups was carried out. Finally, revised estimates of scale reliability were derived using two different methods. Results A one-factor model including correlated error terms on the negatively phrased items showed superior fit in all ethnic groups. Tests for equal factor loadings and intercepts also showed adequate fit demonstrating metric and scalar invariance. Latent and summated scale estimates of mean group differences were similar for all groups. Scale reliability using McDonald's ω is lower than when using the more conventional Cronbach's α. Reliability across groups is reasonably consistent.

We investigated temporal and cross-sectional associations of a weighted score of cumulative environmental liability for schizophrenia - the exposome score for schizophrenia (ES-SCZ) - with functioning in first-episode psychosis (FEP). Methods Data were derived from the baseline and 1-month assessments of the Athens FEP Research Study that enrolled 225 individuals with FEP. The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and the Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) were used to measure social, occupational, and psychological functioning. The ES-SCZ was calculated based on the previously validated method. Results ES-SCZ was associated with the total scores of GAF and PSP at baseline and 1-month assessments. These findings remained significant when accounting for several associated alternative explanatory variables, including other environmental factors (obstetric complications, migration, ethnic minority), clinical characteristics (duration of untreated psychosis, symptom severity, previous antipsychotic use), and family history of psychosis, demonstrating that the association between ES-SCZ and functioning is over and above other risk factors and cannot be explained by symptom severity alone. Functioning improved from baseline to 1-month assessment, but no significant ES-SCZ-by-time interaction was found on functioning, indicating that functioning changes were not contingent on ES-SCZ. Conclusions Our findings suggest that rather than a predictor of functional improvement, ES-SCZ represents a stable severity indicator that captures poor functioning in early psychosis. Environmental risk loading for schizophrenia (ES-SCZ) can be beneficial for clinical characterization and incorporated into transdiagnostic staging models. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

This study investigated their risk of non-affective psychotic disorders (NAPD) and whether this risk is influenced by early childhood adversity, operationalised as age at adoption/residency, and/or gender. Methods Register study in Swedish national cohorts born 1972-1990 including 21 615 non-European international adoptees, 42 732 non-European refugees that settled in Sweden at age 0-14 years and 1 610 233 Swedish born. The study population was followed from age 18 to year 2016 for hospitalisations with a discharge diagnosis of NAPD. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated in gender stratified Cox regression models, adjusted for household income at age 17. Results The adjusted risks of NAPD were 2.33 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.07-2.63] for the international adoptees and 1.92 (1.76-2.09) for the former child refugees, relative to the Swedish-born population. For the international adoptees there was a stepwise gradient for NAPD by age of adoption from adjusted HR 1.66 (1.29-2.03) when adopted during the first year of life to adjusted HR 4.56 (3.22-6.46) when adopted at ages 5-14 years, with a similar risk pattern in women and men. Age at residency did not influence the risk of NAPD in the refugees, but their male to female risk ratio was higher than in Swedish-born and the adoptees. Conclusion The risk pattern in the international adoptees gives support to a link between early childhood adversity and NAPD. Male gender increased the risk of NAPD more among the refugees.

A neurobiological measure of the tendency to overvalue immediate gratification could facilitate the study of individuals who are susceptible to these mental disorders. The objective of this research was to develop a cortical assay of impulsive choice for immediate rewards. Methods A cortex-based assay of impulsive choice was developed using 1105 healthy adults from the Human Connectome Project, and then cross-validated in two independent samples of adults with elevated rates of psychiatric disorders. Results Study 1: Cortical delay discounting (C-DD) was developed using a multivariate additive model of gray matter thickness across both hemispheres. Higher C-DD corresponded to thinner cortex and greater impulsive choice for immediate rewards. It also predicted cannabis use beyond established risk factors for drug use, including familial substance use, childhood conduct problems, personality traits, and cognitive functioning. Study 2: C-DD replicated the association with delay discounting performance from study 1. Structural equation modeling showed C-DD covaried with symptoms of externalizing, but not internalizing disorders. Study 3: C-DD positively predicted future delay discounting behavior (6-34 months later). Conclusions Across three studies, a cortical assay of impulsive choice evidenced consistent associations with drug use and delay discounting task performance. It was also uniquely associated with psychiatric disorders that share impulsivity as a core feature. Together, findings support the utility of C-DD as a neurobiological assay of impulsive decision-making and a possible biomarker of externalizing disorders.  © The Author(s), 2021.

In this study, recurrence of anxiety and its predictors were studied in a large cohort of the adult general population. Methods Baseline, 3-year and 6-year follow-up data were derived from the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study-2 (NEMESIS-2). Respondents (N = 468) who had been in remission for at least a year prior to baseline were included. Recurrence was assessed at 3 and 6 years after baseline, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0. Cumulative recurrence rates were estimated using the number of years since remission of the last anxiety disorder. Furthermore, Cox regression analyses were conducted to investigate predictors of recurrence, using a broad range of putative predictors. Results The estimated cumulative recurrence rate was 2.1% at 1 year, 6.6% at 5 years, 10.6% at 10 years, and 16.2% at 20 years. Univariate regression analyses predicted a shorter time to recurrence for several variables, of which younger age at interview, parental psychopathology, neuroticism and a current depressive disorder remained significant in the, age and gender-adjusted, multivariable regression analysis. Conclusions Recurrence of anxiety disorders in the general population is common and the risk of recurrence extends over a lengthy period of time. In clinical practice, alertness to recurrence, monitoring of symptoms, and quick access to health care in case of recurrence are needed.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Altered glutamate levels have likewise been linked to schizophrenia. Glutamatergic abnormalities may affect the processing of motivational salience and outcome evaluation. It remains unresolved, whether glutamatergic dysfunction is associated with the coding of motivational salience and outcome evaluation in antipsychotic-naïve patients with first-episode psychosis. Methods Fifty-one antipsychotic-naïve patients with first-episode psychosis (22 ± 5.2 years, female/male: 31/20) and 52 healthy controls (HC) matched on age, sex, and parental education underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (3T) in one session. Brain responses to motivational salience and negative outcome evaluation (NOE) were examined using a monetary incentive delay task. Glutamate levels were estimated in the left thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex using LCModel. Results Patients displayed a positive signal change to NOE in the caudate (p = 0.001) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; p = 0.003) compared to HC. No group difference was observed in motivational salience or in levels of glutamate. There was a different association between NOE signal in the caudate and DLPFC and thalamic glutamate levels in patients and HC due to a negative correlation in patients (caudate: p = 0.004, DLPFC: p = 0.005) that was not seen in HC. Conclusions Our findings confirm prior findings of abnormal outcome evaluation as a part of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The results also suggest a possible link between thalamic glutamate and NOE signaling in patients with first-episode psychosis.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods This study included all young adults in Sweden, aged 19-29 years, with an incident diagnosis of ADHD 2006-2011 (n = 9718). Crude and multivariate sex-stratified hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were measured 5 years after the diagnosis of ADHD for the risk of disability pension, long-term sickness absence (SA) (>90 days), long-term unemployment (>180 days) and a combined measure of all three in young adults with ADHD compared to their siblings without ADHD and a matched comparison group. Results In the adjusted analyses young adults with ADHD had a 10-fold higher risk of disability pension (HR = 10.2; CI 9.3-11.2), a nearly three-fold higher risk of long-term SA (HR = 2.7; CI 2.5-2.8) and a 70% higher risk of long-term unemployment (HR = 1.7; CI 1.6-1.8) compared to the matched comparison group. The risk estimates were lower compared to siblings for disability pension (HR = 9.0; CI 6.6-12.3) and long-term SA (HR = 2.5; CI 2.1-3.1) but higher in the long-term unemployed (HR = 1.9; CI 1.6-2.1). Comorbid disorders explained about one-third of the association between ADHD and disability pension, but less regarding SA and long-term unemployment. Conclusions Young adults with ADHD have a high risk for different measures of LMM and comorbidities explain only a small proportion of this relationship.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods In a multi-study sample of 7-18-year-olds (n = 3397), we examined the effect of sex and age on the severity of PTSD symptoms after a single incident trauma at 1 month (T1), and on symptom change after a natural recovery period of 3 (T2) and 6 months (T3). PTSD scores were harmonised across measurement types, and linear regressions were used to determine sex and age effects, adjusting for study level variance and trauma type. Results A sex × age interaction was observed at T1 (p < 0.001) demonstrating that older age was associated with greater PTSD symptom severity in females (β = 0.008, p = 0.047), but less severe symptoms in males (β = -0.011, p = 0.014). The same pattern was observed at T2 and T3, with sex differences beginning to emerge by age 12 years. PTSD symptoms decreased naturally by ~25% at T2 with little further improvement by T3. Further, females showed a greater reduction in symptoms at T3 than males, although the same effect was not observed at T2. Conclusions Sex differences in PTSD symptoms become apparent during adolescence, due to opposing changes in susceptibility occurring in females and males with age. Understanding the factors contributing to these findings is likely to provide wider insight into sex-specific psychological vulnerability to trauma-related psychopathology.

Using a fully data driven approach in a prospective, case-control study, we tested the hypothesis that functional connectivity of these networks carries a neural signature of TD. Our aim was to investigate (i) the brain networks that distinguish adult patients with TD from controls, and (ii) the effects of antipsychotic medication on these networks. Methods Using a multivariate analysis based on support vector machine (SVM), we developed a predictive model of resting state functional connectivity in 48 patients and 51 controls, and identified brain networks that were most affected by disease and pharmacological treatments. We also performed standard univariate analyses to identify differences in specific connections across groups. Results SVM was able to identify TD with 67% accuracy (p = 0.004), based on the connectivity in widespread networks involving the striatum, fronto-parietal cortical areas and the cerebellum. Medicated and unmedicated patients were discriminated with 69% accuracy (p = 0.019), based on the connectivity among striatum, insular and cerebellar networks. Univariate approaches revealed differences in functional connectivity within the striatum in patients v. controls, and between the caudate and insular cortex in medicated v. unmedicated TD. Conclusions SVM was able to identify a neuronal network that distinguishes patients with TD from control, as well as medicated and unmedicated patients with TD, holding a promise to identify imaging-based biomarkers of TD for clinical use and evaluation of the effects of treatment.

We aimed to investigate the relationships between cannabis exposure and risks of receiving mental illness diagnoses or treatment as outcomes. Methods A population based, retrospective, open cohort study using patients recorded in 'IQVIA medical research data', a UK primary care database. Read codes were used to confirm patients with recorded exposure to cannabis use who were matched up to two unexposed patients. We examined the risk of developing three categories of mental ill health: depression, anxiety or serious mental illness (SMI). Results At study entry, the exposed cohort had an increased likelihood of having experienced mental ill health [odds ratio (OR) 4.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.99-4.27] and mental ill health-related prescription (OR 2.95; 95% CI 2.86-3.05) compared to the unexposed group. During the study period we found that exposure to cannabis was associated with an increased risk of developing any mental disorder [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.73; 95% CI 2.59-2.88], also noted when examining by subtype of disorder: anxiety (aHR 2.46; 95% CI 2.29-2.64), depression (aHR 2.34; 95% CI 2.20-2.49) and SMI (aHR 6.41; 95% CI 5.42-7.57). These results remained robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusion These findings point to the potential need for a public health approach to the management of people misusing cannabis. However, there is a gross under-recording of cannabis use in GP records, as seen by the prevalence of recorded cannabis exposure substantially lower than self-reported survey records.

However, previous meta-analyses disagree on these associations, and errors in data extraction may account for these discrepancies. Methods PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to 14 January 2020. Meta-analyses of observational studies examining the association between depression and levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1-β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were eligible. Errors were classified as follows: incorrect sample sizes, incorrectly used standard deviation, incorrect participant inclusion, calculation error, or analysis with insufficient data. We determined their impact on the results after correction thereof. Results Errors were noted in 14 of the 15 meta-analyses included. Across 521 primary studies, 118 (22.6%) showed the following errors: incorrect sample sizes (20 studies, 16.9%), incorrect use of standard deviation (35 studies, 29.7%), incorrect participant inclusion (7 studies, 5.9%), calculation errors (33 studies, 28.0%), and analysis with insufficient data (23 studies, 19.5%). After correcting these errors, 11 (29.7%) out of 37 pooled effect sizes changed by a magnitude of more than 0.1, ranging from 0.11 to 1.15. The updated meta-analyses showed that elevated levels of TNF- α, IL-6, CRP, but not IL-1β, are associated with depression. Conclusions These findings show that data extraction errors in meta-analyses can impact findings. Efforts to reduce such errors are important in studies of the association between depression and peripheral inflammatory biomarkers, for which high heterogeneity and conflicting results have been continuously reported.

We aimed to characterise demographic associations, peripheral inflammatory markers and outcome of catatonia. Methods Electronic healthcare records were searched for validated clinical diagnoses of catatonia. In a case-control study, demographics and inflammatory markers were compared in psychiatric inpatients with and without catatonia. In a cohort study, the two groups were compared in terms of their duration of admission and mortality. Results We identified 1456 patients with catatonia (of whom 25.1% had two or more episodes) and 24 956 psychiatric inpatients without catatonia. Incidence was 10.6 episodes of catatonia per 100 000 person-years. Patients with and without catatonia were similar in sex, younger and more likely to be of Black ethnicity. Serum iron was reduced in patients with catatonia [11.6 v. 14.2 mol/L, odds ratio (OR) 0.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.95), p = 0.03] and creatine kinase was raised [2545 v. 459 IU/L, OR 1.53 (95% CI 1.29-1.81), p < 0.001], but there was no difference in C-reactive protein or white cell count. N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor antibodies were significantly associated with catatonia, but there were small numbers of positive results. Duration of hospitalisation was greater in the catatonia group (median: 43 v. 25 days), but there was no difference in mortality after adjustment. Conclusions In the largest clinical study of catatonia, we found catatonia occurred in approximately 1 per 10 000 person-years. Evidence for a proinflammatory state was mixed. Catatonia was associated with prolonged inpatient admission but not with increased mortality. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

The goal of this study was to better understand the relationships between PMIE exposure and lifetime and past-year alcohol use disorder (AUD), drug use disorder (DUD), and SUD. Methods Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1321 combat veterans. Multivariable analyses examined associations between three types of PMIE exposure (perpetration, witnessing, and betrayal), and lifetime and past-year AUD, DUD, and SUD, adjusting for sociodemographic variables, combat exposure severity, prior trauma, and lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder. Results Perpetration was associated with increased odds of lifetime AUD (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.01-1.31) and lifetime SUD (OR 1.18; 95% CI 1.03-1.35). Witnessing was associated with greater odds of past-year DUD (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.04-1.38) and past-year SUD (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.02-1.28). Betrayal was associated with past-year AUD (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.03-1.39). A large proportion of the variance in past-year AUD was accounted for by betrayal (38.7%), while witnessing accounted for 25.8% of the variance in past-year DUD. Conclusions Exposure to PMIEs may be a stronger contributor to SUDs among veterans than previously known. These findings highlight the importance of targeted assessment and treatment of moral injury among veterans with SUDs, as well as attending to specific types of morally injurious experiences when conceptualizing and planning care.  © US Government, 2021.","Article","Scopus"

However, the precise relationship between these cognitive domains is not well understood. We examined the role of self-reference in emotion and reward processing, separately and in combination, in relation to depression. Methods Adults experiencing varying levels of depression (n = 144) completed self-report depression measures (PHQ-9, BDI-II). We measured self, emotion and reward processing, separately and in combination, using three cognitive tasks. Results When self-processing was measured independently of emotion and reward, in a simple associative learning task, there was little association with depression. However, when self and emotion processing occurred in combination in a self-esteem go/no-go task, depression was associated with an increased positive other bias [b = 3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-5.79]. When the self was processed in relation to emotion and reward, in a social evaluation learning task, depression was associated with reduced positive self-biases (b = 0.11, 95% CI 0.05-0.17). Conclusions Depression was associated with enhanced positive implicit associations with others, and reduced positive learning about the self, culminating in reduced self-favouring biases. However, when self, emotion and reward processing occurred independently there was little evidence of an association with depression. Treatments targeting reduced positive self-biases may provide more sensitive targets for therapeutic intervention and potential biomarkers of treatment responses, allowing the development of more effective interventions.

Such multi-modular programmes (1) may be unnecessarily long for those who do not require a full course of intervention and (2) make it difficult to distinguish those techniques that are effective from those that are redundant. Since dietary restraint is a well-replicated risk and maintaining factor for binge eating, we developed an internet- and app-based intervention composed solely of cognitive-behavioural techniques designed to modify dietary restraint as a mechanism to target binge eating. We tested the efficacy of this combined selective and indicated prevention programme in 403 participants, most of whom were highly symptomatic (90% reported binge eating once per week). Method Participants were randomly assigned to the internet intervention (n = 201) or an informational control group (n = 202). The primary outcome was objective binge-eating frequency. Secondary outcomes were indices of dietary restraint, shape, weight, and eating concerns, subjective binge eating, disinhibition, and psychological distress. Analyses were intention-to-treat. Results Intervention participants reported greater reductions in objective binge-eating episodes compared to the control group at post-test (small effect size). Significant effects were also observed on each of the secondary outcomes (small to large effect sizes). Improvements were sustained at 8 week follow-up. Conclusions Highly focused digital interventions that target one central risk/maintaining factor may be sufficient to induce meaningful change in core eating disorder symptoms.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Yet, there are no known efficacious treatments for anhedonia and reward deficits associated with chronic opioid use. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a novel behavioral intervention combining training in mindfulness with savoring of natural rewards, may hold promise for treating anhedonia in LTOT. Methods Veterans receiving LTOT (N = 63) for chronic pain were randomized to 8 weeks of MORE or a supportive group (SG) psychotherapy control. Before and after the 8-week treatment groups, we assessed the effects of MORE on the late positive potential (LPP) of the electroencephalogram and skin conductance level (SCL) during viewing and up-regulating responses (i.e. savoring) to natural reward cues. We then examined whether these neurophysiological effects were associated with reductions in subjective anhedonia by 4-month follow-up. Results Patients treated with MORE demonstrated significantly increased LPP and SCL to natural reward cues and greater decreases in subjective anhedonia relative to those in the SG. The effect of MORE on reducing anhedonia was statistically mediated by increases in LPP response during savoring. Conclusions MORE enhances motivated attention to natural reward cues among chronic pain patients on LTOT, as evidenced by increased electrocortical and sympathetic nervous system responses. Given neurophysiological evidence of clinical target engagement, MORE may be an efficacious treatment for anhedonia among chronic opioid users, people with chronic pain, and those at risk for opioid use disorder.

Our aim was to explore whether (i) a predictive CT pattern for transdiagnostic psychopathology exists, and whether (ii) CT can differentiate between distinct diagnosis-dependent psychopathology. Furthermore, we aimed to identify the association between CT, psychopathology and brain structure. Methods We used multivariate pattern analysis in data from 643 participants of the Personalised Prognostic Tools for Early Psychosis Management study (PRONIA), including healthy controls (HC), recent onset psychosis (ROP), recent onset depression (ROD), and patients clinically at high-risk for psychosis (CHR). Participants completed structured interviews and self-report measures including the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, SCID diagnostic interview, BDI-II, PANSS, Schizophrenia Proneness Instrument, Structured Interview for Prodromal Symptoms and structural MRI, analyzed by voxel-based morphometry. Results (i) Patients and HC could be distinguished by their CT pattern with a reasonable precision [balanced accuracy of 71.2% (sensitivity = 72.1%, specificity = 70.4%, p ≤ 0.001]. (ii) Subdomains 'emotional neglect' and 'emotional abuse' were most predictive for CHR and ROP, while in ROD 'physical abuse' and 'sexual abuse' were most important. The CT pattern was significantly associated with the severity of depressive symptoms in ROD, ROP, and CHR, as well as with the PANSS total and negative domain scores in the CHR patients. No associations between group-separating CT patterns and brain structure were found. Conclusions These results indicate that CT poses a transdiagnostic risk factor for mental health disorders, possibly related to depressive symptoms. While differences in the quality of CT exposure exist, diagnostic differentiation was not possible suggesting a multi-factorial pathogenesis.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

This study examined how the offspring's risk of attempting or dying by suicide varied by the timing of a first parental SA and the sex of the parent who attempted suicide. Methods Participants were 59 469 members of the 1987 Finnish Birth Cohort. The Finnish Hospital Discharge and Cause of Death Registers were the sources for parental and offspring SAs and offspring suicide. Timing of parental SA was coded as before (pre-pregnancy and pregnancy) and after the child's birth [infant/toddler years (0-2 years), childhood (3-11 years), adolescence (12-17 years), and young adulthood (18-26 years)]. Results In the multivariate models, having a parent who attempted suicide increased the offspring's risk of attempting suicide (odds ratio (OR) = 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-2.25), but not of dying by suicide. Compared to unexposed offspring, those exposed after child's birth were at higher risk of attempting suicide (OR = 1.90, 95% CI 1.46-2.47), specifically when the parent attempted during offspring's childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood. A first maternal SA increased offspring's risk of attempting suicide regardless of the timing. Conclusions The impact of a parental SA on offspring's risk of attempting suicide differed depending on the timing and sex of the parent who attempted suicide, suggesting that the transmission of suicide risk may occur through genetic as well as environmental factors. Our findings call for an intergenerational approach in suicide risk assessment.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We tested this hypothesis for the treatment outcome of compulsory admission. Methods Data from the 2010-2011 Mental Health Minimum Dataset (N = 1 053 617) was linked to the 2011 Census and 2010 Index of Multiple Deprivation. Own-group ethnic density was calculated by dividing the number of residents per ethnic group for each lower layer super output area (LSOA) in the Census by the LSOA total population. Multilevel modelling estimated the effect of own-group ethnic density on the risk of compulsory admission by ethnic group (White British, White other, Black, Asian and mixed), accounting for patient characteristics (age and gender), area-level deprivation and population density. Results Asian and White British patients experienced a reduced risk of compulsory admission when living in the areas of high own-group ethnic density [odds ratios (OR) 0.97, 95% credible interval (CI) 0.95-0.99 and 0.94, 95% CI 0.93-0.95, respectively], whereas White minority patients were at increased risk when living in neighbourhoods of higher own-group ethnic concentration (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.26). Higher levels of own-group ethnic density were associated with an increased risk of compulsory admission for mixed-ethnicity patients, but only when deprivation and population density were excluded from the model. Neighbourhood-level concentration of own-group ethnicity for Black patients did not influence the risk of compulsory admission.

Negative symptoms are prominent among individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis (i.e. those with prodromal syndromes) and predictive of conversion to illness. Mechanisms underlying negative symptoms are unclear in the CHR population. Methods The current study evaluated whether CHR participants demonstrated deficits in the willingness to expend effort for rewards and whether these impairments are associated with negative symptoms and greater risk for conversion. Participants included 44 CHR participants and 32 healthy controls (CN) who completed the Effort Expenditure for Reward Task (EEfRT). Results Compared to CN, CHR participants displayed reduced likelihood of exerting high effort for high probability and magnitude rewards. Among CHR participants, reduced effort expenditure was associated with greater negative symptom severity and greater probability of conversion to a psychotic disorder on a cross-sectional risk calculator.

The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS®) has been shown to effectively improve social skills for adolescents on the spectrum across different social cultures. However, the effectiveness for young adults beyond North America has yet to be examined. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the PEERS intervention in Taiwanese young adults with ASD, and examine its durability and clinical correlates. Methods We recruited 82 cognitively-able young adults with ASD, randomized to the PEERS treatment or treatment-as-usual. Results Following treatment, significant improvement was found in aspects of social deficits, autism severity, social interaction anxiety, empathy, and social skills knowledge either by self-report or coach-report. Additionally, communicative behaviors rated by observers improved throughout the sessions, showing a trend toward more appropriate eye contact, gestures, facial expression during conversation, and appropriate maintenance of conversation and reciprocity. Most effects maintained at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. The improvement of social deficits was positively correlated with baseline severity, while gains in social skills knowledge were positively correlated with IQ. The improvement of social deficits, autism severity, and empathy were positively correlated with each other. Conclusion Overall, the PEERS intervention appears to effectively improve social functioning in Taiwanese young adults with ASD. Improvement of social response and knowledge may be predicted by baseline severity and intelligence respectively.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

We aimed to examine the rate of dementia diagnosis in individuals with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP) compared to those without VLOSLP. Methods Using Swedish population register data, we established a cohort of 15 409 participants with VLOSLP matched by age and calendar period to 154 090 individuals without VLOSLP. Participants were born between 1920 and 1949 and followed from their date of first International Classification of Diseases [ICD], Revisions 8-10 (ICD-8/9/10) non-affective psychotic disorder diagnosis after age 60 years old (or the same date for matched participants) until the end of follow-up (30th December 2011), emigration, death, or first recorded ICD-8/9/10 dementia diagnosis. Results We found a substantially higher rate of dementia in individuals with VLOSLP [hazard ratio (HR): 4.22, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 4.05-4.41]. Median time-to-dementia-diagnosis was 75% shorter in those with VLOSLP (time ratio: 0.25, 95% CI 0.24-0.26). This association was strongest in the first year following VLOSLP diagnosis, and attenuated over time, although dementia rates remained higher in participants with VLOSLP for up to 20 years of follow-up. This association remained after accounting for potential misdiagnosis (2-year washout HR: 2.22, 95% CI 2.10-2.36), ascertainment bias (HR: 2.89, 95% CI 2.75-3.04), and differing mortality patterns between groups (subdistribution HR: 2.89, 95% CI 2.77-3.03). Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that individuals with VLOSLP represent a high-risk group for subsequent dementia. This may be due to early prodromal changes for some individuals, highlighting the importance of ongoing symptom monitoring in people with VLOSLP.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

We investigated these hypotheses in a large prospective study of UK women with no previous vascular disease. Methods At baseline in median year 2001 (IQR 2001-2003), Million Women Study participants reported whether or not they were currently being treated for depression or anxiety, their self-rated health, and medication use during the previous 4 weeks. Follow-up was through linkage to national hospital admission and mortality databases. Cox regression yielded adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the first myocardial infarction event in those reporting treatment for depression or anxiety (subdivided by whether or not the treatment was with psychotropic drugs) v. not, and stratified by self-reported health and length of follow-up. Results During mean follow-up of 13.9 years of 690 335 women (mean age 59.8 years) with no prior heart disease, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, or cancer, 12 819 had a first hospital admission or death from myocardial infarction. The aHRs for those reporting treatment for depression or anxiety with, and without, regular use of psychotropic drugs were 0.96 (95% CI 0.89-1.03) and 0.99 (0.89-1.11), respectively. No associations were found separately in women who reported being in good/excellent or poor/fair health or by length of follow-up.

Methods Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were obtained from 81 adults with BD while they performed an emotion processing task. CPM with 5000 permutations of leave-one-out cross-validation was applied to identify functional connectomes predictive of depressed and elevated mood symptom scores on the Hamilton Depression and Young Mania rating scales. The predictive ability of the identified connectomes was tested in an independent sample of 43 adults with BD. Results CPM predicted the severity of depressed [concordance between actual and predicted values (r = 0.23, pperm (permutation test) = 0.031) and elevated (r = 0.27, pperm = 0.01) mood. Functional connectivity of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and supplementary motor area nodes, with inter- and intra-hemispheric connections to other anterior and posterior cortical, limbic, motor, and cerebellar regions, predicted depressed mood severity. Connectivity of left fusiform and right visual association area nodes with inter- and intra-hemispheric connections to the motor, insular, limbic, and posterior cortices predicted elevated mood severity. These networks were predictive of mood symptomatology in the independent sample (r © 0.45, p = 0.002). Conclusions This study identified distributed functional connectomes predictive of depressed and elevated mood severity in BD. Connectomes subserving emotional, cognitive, and psychomotor control predicted depressed mood severity, while those subserving emotional and social perceptual functions predicted elevated mood severity. Identification of these connectome networks may help inform the development of targeted treatments for mood symptoms.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

This study investigates whether the mortality rate in this group has changed over the last decade. Methods Using Clinical Record Interactive Search software, we extracted data from a large electronic database of patients in South East London. All patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder from 2008 to 2012 and/or 2013 to 2017 were included. Estimates of life expectancy at birth, standardised mortality ratios and causes of death were obtained for each cohort according to diagnosis and gender. Comparisons were made between cohorts and with the general population using data obtained from the UK Office of National Statistics. Results In total, 26 005 patients were included. In men, life expectancy was greater in 2013-2017 (64.9 years; 95% CI 63.6-66.3) than in 2008-2012 (63.2 years; 95% CI 61.5-64.9). Similarly, in women, life expectancy was greater in 2013-2017 (69.1 years; 95% CI 67.5-70.7) than in 2008-2012 (68.1 years; 95% CI 66.2-69.9). The difference with general population life expectancy fell by 0.9 years between cohorts in men, and 0.5 years in women. In the 2013-2017 cohorts, cancer accounted for a similar proportion of deaths as cardiovascular disease. Conclusions Relative to the general population, life expectancy for people with SMI is still much worse, though it appears to be improving. The increased cancer-related mortality suggests that physical health monitoring should consider including cancer as well.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods At age 18, 21, 25, 30, and 35, participants reported on their methamphetamine use and psychotic symptoms in the period since the previous interview. Generalized estimating equations modelled the association between methamphetamine use and psychotic symptoms (percentage reporting any symptom, and number of symptoms per participant). Confounding factors included childhood individual characteristics, family socioeconomic circumstances and family functioning. Long term effects of methamphetamine use on psychotic symptoms were assessed by comparing the incidence of psychotic symptoms at age 30-35 for those with and without a history of methamphetamine use prior to age 30. Results After adjusting for confounding factors and time-varying covariate factors including concurrent cannabis use, methamphetamine use was associated with a modest increase in psychosis risk over five waves of data (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.72 for the percentage measure; and IRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.50 for the symptom count measure). The increased risk of psychotic symptoms was concentrated among participants who had used at least weekly at any point (adjusted OR 2.85, 95% CI 1.21-6.69). Use of methamphetamine less than weekly was not associated with increased psychosis risk. We found no evidence for a persistent vulnerability to psychosis in the absence of continuing methamphetamine use. Conclusion Methamphetamine use is associated with increased risk of psychotic symptoms in the general population. Increased risk is chiefly confined to people who ever used regularly (at least weekly), and recently.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Methods A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using Taiwan Illicit Drug Issue Database (TIDID) and National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) during 2012-2016. We included 9149 and 11 112 MMT patients as the short and long groups according to the length of their cumulative MMT duration, 1-364 and © 365 days, respectively. The risk of mortality was calculated by Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-dependent exposure to MMT, and the survival probability was plotted with the Kaplan-Meier curve.

Methods In the Swedish general population born 1932-1995 and followed through 2017 (n = 7 661 519), we calculate family genetic risk scores (FGRS) for SA, SD, MD, BD, SZ, AUD, and DUD. Registration for SA and SD was assessed from Swedish national registers. Results In univariate and multivariate models predicting SA, FGRS were highest for SA, AUD, DUD, and MD. In univariate models predicting SD, the strongest FGRS were AUD, DUD, SA, and SD. In multivariate models, the FGRS for SA and AUD were higher in predicting SA while the FGRS for SD, BD, and SZ were higher in predicting SD. Higher FGRS for all disorders significantly predicted both younger age at first SA and frequency of attempts. For SD, higher FGRS for MD, AUD, and SD predicted later age at SD. Mediation of FGRS effects on SA and SD was more pronounced for SD than SA, strongest for AUD, DUD, and SZ FGRS and weakest for MD. Conclusions FGRS for both SA and SD and for our five psychiatric disorders impact on risk for SA and SD in a complex manner. While some of the impact of genetic risk factors for psychiatric disorders on risk for SA and SD is mediated through developing the disorders, these risks also predispose directly to suicidal behaviors.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods The COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study is a longitudinal, nationally representative, online survey of UK adults. The current study analysed data from its first three waves of data collection: Wave 1 (March 2020, N = 2025), Wave 2 (April 2020, N = 1406) and Wave 3 (July 2020, N = 1166). Anxiety-depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (a composite measure of the PHQ-9 and GAD-7) and COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the International Trauma Questionnaire. Changes in mental health outcomes were modelled across the three waves. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify subgroups of individuals with different trajectories of change in anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Latent class membership was regressed on baseline characteristics. Results Overall prevalence of anxiety-depression remained stable, while COVID-19 PTSD reduced between Waves 2 and 3. Heterogeneity in mental health response was found, and hypothesised classes reflecting (i) stability, (ii) improvement and (iii) deterioration in mental health were identified. Psychological factors were most likely to differentiate the improving, deteriorating and high-stable classes from the low-stable mental health trajectories. Conclusions A low-stable profile characterised by little-to-no psychological distress ('resilient' class) was the most common trajectory for both anxiety-depression and COVID-19 PTSD. Monitoring these trajectories is necessary moving forward, in particular for the ~30% of individuals with increasing anxiety-depression levels.  © The Author(s), 2021.

To date, however, no known study has examined changes in mental health during the pandemic in the U.S. military veteran population. Methods Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative, prospective cohort survey of 3078 veterans. Pre-to-peri-pandemic changes in psychiatric symptoms were evaluated, as well as pre-pandemic risk and protective factors and pandemic-related correlates of increased psychiatric distress. Results The prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) positive screens increased from pre- to peri-pandemic (7.1% to 9.4%; p < 0.001) and was driven by an increase among veterans aged 45-64 years (8.2% to 13.5%; p < 0.001), but the prevalence of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder positive screens remained stable. Using a continuous measure of psychiatric distress, an estimated 13.2% of veterans reported a clinically meaningful pre-to-peri-pandemic increase in distress (mean = 1.1 standard deviation). Veterans with a larger pre-pandemic social network size and secure attachment style were less likely to experience increased distress, whereas veterans reporting more pre-pandemic loneliness were more likely to experience increased distress. Concerns about pandemic-related social losses, mental health COVID-19 effects, and housing stability during the pandemic were associated with increased distress, over-and-above pre-pandemic factors. Conclusions Although most U.S. veterans showed resilience to mental health problems nearly 1 year into the pandemic, the prevalence of GAD positive screens increased, particularly among middle-aged veterans, and one of seven veterans experienced increased distress. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

For example, some show a decrease in symptoms, whilst others experience an intensification of difficulties. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a dimensional condition, representing one end of a trait continuum that extends throughout the population. To date, no studies have investigated chronogeneity across the full range of autistic traits. We investigated the nature and clinical significance of autism trait chronogeneity in a large, general population sample. Methods Autistic social/communication traits (ASTs) were measured in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children using the Social and Communication Disorders Checklist (SCDC) at ages 7, 10, 13 and 16 (N = 9744). We used Growth Mixture Modelling (GMM) to identify groups defined by their AST trajectories. Measures of ASD diagnosis, sex, IQ and mental health (internalising and externalising) were used to investigate external validity of the derived trajectory groups. Results The selected GMM model identified four AST trajectory groups: (i) Persistent High (2.3% of sample), (ii) Persistent Low (83.5%), (iii) Increasing (7.3%) and (iv) Decreasing (6.9%) trajectories. The Increasing group, in which females were a slight majority (53.2%), showed dramatic increases in SCDC scores during adolescence, accompanied by escalating internalising and externalising difficulties. Two-thirds (63.6%) of the Decreasing group were male. Conclusions Clinicians should note that for some young people autism-trait-like social difficulties first emerge during adolescence accompanied by problems with mood, anxiety, conduct and attention. A converse, majority-male group shows decreasing social difficulties during adolescence.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Methods We studied three groups of young adults (Mage = 25 years, s.d. = 3.84 years): probands with histories of childhood onset depression - i.e. early-onset phenotype - (n = 293), their unaffected siblings (high-risk siblings, n = 273), and healthy controls (n = 171). Participants completed a full psychiatric interview, physical and laboratory assessments, and self-rating scales. MetS was defined using the criteria of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (2001). Results Early-onset depression phenotype and being a high-risk sibling were associated with higher MetS composite scores relative to that of controls, but did not differ from one another. With regard to MetS components: Probands and siblings had similarly larger waist circumference and lower HDL than did controls, while siblings and controls had lower triglyceride levels than did probands but did not differ from one another. Groups did not differ on glucose levels and SBP. Conclusions Our study extends the literature on the association between MetS and depression and underscores the importance of depression phenotypes: failure to account for the clinical heterogeneity of depression may partly underlie the inconsistent findings regarding its relation to MetS. The results also suggest that, in depression-prone populations, MetS may predate and possibly function as a risk factor for eventual depression.  © The Author(s), 2021.

We assessed whether both forms of wellbeing are associated with neural activity engaged during positive and negative emotion processing and the extent to which this association is driven by genetics or environment. Methods We assessed mental wellbeing in 230 healthy adult monozygotic and dizygotic twins using a previously validated questionnaire (COMPAS-W) and undertook functional magnetic resonance imaging during a facial emotion viewing task. We used linear mixed models to analyse the association between COMPAS-W scores and emotion-elicited neural activation. Univariate twin modelling was used to evaluate heritability of each brain region. Multivariate twin modelling was used to compare twin pairs to assess the contributions of genetic and environmental factors to this association. Results Higher levels of wellbeing were associated with greater neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, localised in the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), in response to positive emotional expressions of happiness. Univariate twin modelling showed activity in the IFG to have 20% heritability. Multivariate twin modelling suggested that the association between wellbeing and positive emotion-elicited neural activity was driven by common variance from unique environment (r = 0.208) rather than shared genetics. Conclusions Higher mental wellbeing may have a basis in greater engagement of prefrontal neural regions in response to positive emotion, and this association may be modifiable by unique life experiences.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Method We included 54 999 self-harm presentations (involving 31 419 individuals) to hospitals in the Multicentre Study of Self-harm in England (1/1/2004-31/12/2014), with mortality follow-up to 31/12/2019. Information on method of self-harm was obtained through monitoring in hospitals. Information about mortality was obtained through linkage with NHS Digital. We assessed the association of site of self-cut with death by suicide using mixed effect models. Results In total, 10 790 (19.6%) hospital presentations involved self-cutting/stabbing, 7489 of which (69.4%) were due to laceration to the arm/wrist alone, 1846 episodes (17.1%) involved cutting elsewhere on the body, and 1455 (13.5%) were due to laceration to unknown site. Controlling for confounders, presentation to a hospital following self-cut/stab to bodily parts other than wrist/arm was associated with greater chance of subsequent suicide relative to presentation after self-poisoning alone [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-2.96, p = 0.038]. The likelihood of suicide after presentation for cutting/stabbing the wrist/arm alone was comparable to that of patients who had self-poisoned alone. Presentations after laceration involving the neck were associated with a four-fold greater chance of subsequent suicide relative to self-poisoning (aOR 4.09, 95% CI 1.80-9.30, p = 0.001). Conclusions Patients who attend hospital after self-cutting/stabbing are a heterogeneous group in terms of characteristics, methods of cutting/stabbing and risk of subsequent suicide. Risk of suicide is greater in individuals who self-cut/stab to parts of the body other than the wrist or arm, especially the neck.  © The Author(s), 2021.

However, the generalization of the findings to real-world patients is limited due to inherent caveats of the RCT. We aimed to investigate the treatment discontinuation and risk of psychiatric hospitalization using a nationwide population database. Methods The Health Insurance Review Agency database in South Korea was obtained, and the observation period started from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2016. We defined the maintenance period as the period from 6-month after the diagnosis of schizophrenia, which is utilized for the main results. For a total of 44 396 patients with FES, a within-individual Cox regression model was used to compare the risk of the treatment discontinuation and psychiatric hospitalization. Results In group comparison, a long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotic group was associated with the lowest risk of the treatment discontinuation (0.64, 0.55-0.75) and psychiatric hospitalization (0.29, 0.22-0.38) in comparison with a typical antipsychotic group and no use, respectively. Among individual antipsychotics, the lowest risk of the treatment discontinuation was observed in LAI paliperidone (0.46, 0.37-0.66) compared to olanzapine. Clozapine was found to be the most effective antipsychotic in lowering the risk of psychiatric hospitalization as monotherapy compared to no use (0.23, 0.18-0.31). Conclusions In real-world patients with FES, LAI paliperidone and clozapine were associated with low treatment discontinuation and better effectiveness in lowering the risk of psychiatric hospitalization.

Though adult psychopathic traits emerge from both genetic and environmental risk, no studies have examined etiologic associations between adult psychopathic traits and experiences of parenting in childhood, or the extent to which parenting practices may impact the heritability of adult psychopathic traits using a genetically-informed design. Methods In total, 1842 adult twins from the community reported their current psychopathic traits and experiences of negative parenting during childhood. We fit bivariate genetic models to the data, decomposing the variance within, and the covariance between, psychopathic traits and perceived negative parenting into their genetic and environmental components. We then fit a genotype × environment interaction model to evaluate whether negative parenting moderated the etiology of psychopathic traits. Results Psychopathic traits were moderately heritable with substantial non-shared environmental influences. There were significant associations between perceived negative parenting and three of four psychopathy facets (interpersonal manipulation, erratic lifestyle, antisocial tendencies, but not callous affect). These associations were attributable to a common non-shared environmental pathway and not to overlapping genetic effects. Additionally, we found that primarily shared environmental influences were stronger on psychopathic traits for individuals with a history of greater negative parenting. Conclusions Utilizing a genetically-informed design, we found that both genetic and non-shared environmental factors contribute to the emergence of psychopathic traits. Moreover, perceptions of negative parenting emerged as a clear environmental influence on the development of interpersonal, lifestyle, and antisocial features of psychopathy.

The authors aimed to determine the familial risk of suicide in Utah, and tested whether familial risk varies based on the characteristics of the suicides and their relatives. Methods A population-based sample of 12 160 suicides from 1904 to 2014 were identified from the Utah Population Database and matched 1:5 to controls based on sex and age using at-risk sampling. All first through third- and fifth-degree relatives of suicide probands and controls were identified (N = 13 480 122). The familial risk of suicide was estimated based on hazard ratios (HR) from an unsupervised Cox regression model in a unified framework. Moderation by sex of the proband or relative and age of the proband at time of suicide (<25 v. ≥ 25 years) was examined. Results Significantly elevated HRs were observed in first- (HR 3.45; 95% CI 3.12-3.82) through fifth-degree relatives (HR 1.07; 95% CI 1.02-1.12) of suicide probands. Among first-degree relatives of female suicide probands, the HR of suicide was 6.99 (95% CI 3.99-12.25) in mothers, 6.39 in sisters (95% CI 3.78-10.82), and 5.65 (95% CI 3.38-9.44) in daughters. The HR in first-degree relatives of suicide probands under 25 years at death was 4.29 (95% CI 3.49-5.26). Conclusions Elevated familial suicide risk in relatives of female and younger suicide probands suggests that there are unique risk groups to which prevention efforts should be directed - namely suicidal young adults and women with a strong family history of suicide.  © The Author(s), 2021.

We explored sex differences and the role of familial factors and externalizing problems in the association between several NDs and violent victimization in adolescence and young adulthood. Methods Individuals born in Sweden 1985-1997, residing in Sweden at their 15th birthday, were followed until date of violent victimization causing a hospital visit or death, death due to other causes, emigration, or December 31, 2013, whichever came first. The exposures were diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID) and other NDs. We used three different Cox regression models: a crude model, a model adjusted for familial confounding using sibling-comparisons, and a model additionally adjusted for externalizing problems. Results Among 1 344 944 individuals followed, on average, for 5 years, 74 487 were diagnosed with NDs and 37 765 had a hospital visit or died due to violence. ADHD was associated with an increased risk of violent victimization in males [hazard ratio (HR) 2.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.43-2.70) and females (HR 5.39; 95% CI 4.97-5.85). ASD and ID were associated with an increased risk of violent victimization in females only. After adjusting for familial factors and externalizing problems, only ADHD was associated with violent victimization among males (HR 1.27; 95% CI 1.06-1.51) and females (HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.21-2.36). Conclusions Females with NDs and males with ADHD are at greater risk of being victim of severe violence during adolescence and young adulthood.

Less is known for countries with only a recent history of migration. This study aimed to determine the risk for developing a psychotic disorder in migrants to the Republic of Ireland. Methods We included all presentations of first-episode psychosis over 8.5 years to the DETECT Early Intervention for psychosis service in the Republic of Ireland (573 individuals aged 18-65, of whom 22% were first-generation migrants). Psychotic disorder diagnosis relied on SCID. The at-risk population was calculated using census data, and negative binomial regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios. Results The annual crude incidence rate for a first-episode psychotic disorder in the total cohort was 25.62 per 100000 population at risk. Migrants from Africa had a nearly twofold increased risk for developing a psychotic disorder compared to those born in the Republic of Ireland (IRR = 1.83, 95% CI 1.11-3.02, p = 0.02). In contrast, migrants from certain Asian countries had a reduced risk, specifically those from China, India, Philippines, Pakistan, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Hong Kong (aIRR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.16-0.81, p = 0.01). Conclusions Further research into the reasons for this inflated risk in specific migrant groups could produce insights into the aetiology of psychotic disorders. This information should also be used, alongside other data on environmental risk factors that can be determined from census data, to predict the incidence of psychotic disorders and thereby resource services appropriately.

Methods We used Danish nation-wide population-based longitudinal register linkage to investigate socio-economic functioning in 19 955 patients with bipolar disorder, their 13 923 siblings and 20 sex, age and calendar-matched control individuals from the general population. Follow-up was from 1995 to 2017. Results Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder had lower odds of having achieved the highest educational level [OR 0.75 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.77)], being employed [OR 0.16 (95% CI 0.159-0.168)], having achieved the 80% highest quartile of income [OR 0.33 (95% CI 0.32-0.35)], cohabitating [OR 0.44 (95% CI 0.43-0.46)] and being married [OR 0.54 (95% CI 0.52-0.55)] at first contact to hospital psychiatry as inpatient or outpatient compared with control individuals from the general population. Similarly, siblings to patients with bipolar disorder had a lower functioning within all five socio-economic areas than control individuals. Furthermore, patients and partly siblings showed substantially decreased ability to enhance their socio-economic functioning during the 23 years follow-up compared to controls. Conclusions Socio-economic functioning is substantially decreased in patients with bipolar disorder and their siblings and does not improve during long-term follow-up after the initial hospital contact, highlighting a severe and overlooked treatment gap.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models promise to detect psychopathology in natural language, but they have been evaluated primarily in non-clinical settings using social media. This study sought to test the ability of AI-based language assessments to predict PTSD symptom trajectories among responders. Methods Participants were 124 responders whose health was monitored at the Stony Brook WTC Health and Wellness Program who completed oral history interviews about their initial WTC experiences. PTSD symptom severity was measured longitudinally using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) for up to 7 years post-interview. AI-based indicators were computed for depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and extraversion along with dictionary-based measures of linguistic and interpersonal style. Linear regression and multilevel models estimated associations of AI indicators with concurrent and subsequent PTSD symptom severity (significance adjusted by false discovery rate). Results Cross-sectionally, greater depressive language (β = 0.32; p = 0.049) and first-person singular usage (β = 0.31; p = 0.049) were associated with increased symptom severity. Longitudinally, anxious language predicted future worsening in PCL scores (β = 0.30; p = 0.049), whereas first-person plural usage (β = -0.36; p = 0.014) and longer words usage (β = -0.35; p = 0.014) predicted improvement. Conclusions This is the first study to demonstrate the value of AI in understanding PTSD in a vulnerable population. Future studies should extend this application to other trauma exposures and to other demographic groups, especially under-represented minorities.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

However, the underlying mechanisms of between- and within-generational anxiety resemblance remain poorly understood. By disentangling the genetic v. environmental sources of familial resemblance in anxiety, we can help prevent within-family transmission of anxiety disorders. Therefore, data from both parents and twins are needed to obtain unbiased and detailed estimations of genetic and environmental sources of similarity between family members. Methods We examined data from 991 families with same-sex twins. Trait anxiety in twins was assessed via self-report and parent report, while parental trait anxiety was assessed via self-report. We established a nuclear twin family model and estimated genetic and environmental variances using two survey waves. Results The results suggested that additive genetic (A), dominant genetic (D), and non-shared environmental (E) influences significantly contributed to trait anxiety, whereas familial environmental influences (F) and passive gene-environment correlations (rGE) did not. Sibling environmental influences (S) were only found in self-report data, and increased when genetic influences decreased from Wave 1 to Wave 2. Conclusions Our study highlights the important role of broad heritability in intrafamilial trait anxiety similarity. Parent-child resemblance occurred primarily due to shared genetic makeup rather than direct environmental transmission. Sibling-specific environments, as the only source of shared environments, need further investigation. These findings have both theoretical and practical significance for anxiety disorders. Future research can expand our understanding by examining the gene-environment interplay and sex differences.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Understanding the aetiology of disorder emergence and recovery is important for establishing preventative measures and optimising treatment. Experimental approaches can serve as a useful model for disorder and recovery relevant processes. One such model is fear conditioning. We conducted a remote fear conditioning paradigm in monozygotic and dizygotic twins to determine the degree and extent of overlap between genetic and environmental influences on fear acquisition and extinction. Methods In total, 1937 twins aged 22-25 years, including 538 complete pairs from the Twins Early Development Study took part in a fear conditioning experiment delivered remotely via the Fear Learning and Anxiety Response (FLARe) smartphone app. In the fear acquisition phase, participants were exposed to two neutral shape stimuli, one of which was repeatedly paired with a loud aversive noise, while the other was never paired with anything aversive. In the extinction phase, the shapes were repeatedly presented again, this time without the aversive noise. Outcomes were participant ratings of how much they expected the aversive noise to occur when they saw either shape, throughout each phase. Results Twin analyses indicated a significant contribution of genetic effects to the initial acquisition and consolidation of fear, and the extinction of fear (15, 30 and 15%, respectively) with the remainder of variance due to the non-shared environment. Multivariate analyses revealed that the development of fear and fear extinction show moderate genetic overlap (genetic correlations 0.4-0.5). Conclusions Fear acquisition and extinction are heritable, and share some, but not all of the same genetic influences. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

However, little is known about the gene-environment (G × E) mechanisms underlying their aetiology. For the first time, we tested the independent and interactive associations of ACEs and polygenic scores of major depressive disorder (MDD-PGS) and C-reactive protein (CRP-PGS) with longitudinal trajectories of depression and chronic inflammation in older adults. Methods Data were drawn from the English longitudinal study of ageing (N~3400). Retrospective information on ACEs was collected in wave3 (2006/07). We calculated a cumulative risk score of ACEs and also assessed distinct dimensions separately. Depressive symptoms were ascertained on eight occasions, from wave1 (2002/03) to wave8 (2016/17). CRP was measured in wave2 (2004/05), wave4 (2008/09), and wave6 (2012/13). The associations of the risk factors with group-based depressive-symptom trajectories and repeated exposure to high CRP (i.e. ≥ mg/L) were tested using multinomial and ordinal logistic regression. Results All types of ACEs were independently associated with high depressive-symptom trajectories (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.30-1.60) and inflammation (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.07-1.09). The risk of high depressive-symptom trajectories (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.28-1.70) and inflammation (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04) was also higher for participants with higher MDD-PGS. G×E analyses revealed that the associations between ACEs and depressive symptoms were larger among participants with higher MDD-PGS (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.23). ACEs were also more strongly related to inflammation in participants with higher CRP-PGS (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03). Conclusions ACEs and polygenic susceptibility were independently and interactively associated with elevated depressive symptoms and chronic inflammation, highlighting the clinical importance of assessing both ACEs and genetic risk factors to design more targeted interventions.  © The Author(s), 2021.

The models have typically been based on samples from specialized clinics. We evaluated the generalizability of 19 prediction models to clinical practice in an unselected adolescent psychiatric sample. Methods In total, 153 adolescent psychiatric patients in the Helsinki Prodromal Study underwent an extensive baseline assessment including the SIPS interview and a neurocognitive battery, with 50 participants (33%) fulfilling CHR criteria. The adolescents were followed up for 7 years using comprehensive national registers. Assessed outcomes were (1) any psychotic disorder diagnosis (n = 18, 12%) and (2) first psychiatric hospitalization (n = 25, 16%) as an index of overall deterioration of functioning. Results Most models improved the overall prediction accuracy over standard CHR criteria (area under the curve estimates ranging between 0.51 and 0.82), although the accuracy was worse than that in the samples used to develop the models, also when applied only to the CHR subsample. The best models for transition to psychosis included the severity of positive symptoms, especially delusions, and negative symptoms. Exploratory models revealed baseline negative symptoms, low functioning, delusions, and sleep problems in combination to be the best predictor of psychiatric hospitalization in the upcoming years. Conclusions Including the severity levels of both positive and negative symptomatology proved beneficial in predicting psychosis. Despite these advances, the applicability of extended psychosis-risk models to general psychiatric practice appears limited.  © The Author(s), 2021.

In SZ, MMN was significantly correlated with FAST (r = 0.48) and CCFT (r = -0.31). In BPD, MMN was significantly correlated with DMS (r = -0.54). For P3a, RVP and FAST scores were significant predictors in SZ, whereas RVP, WAIS and FAST were significant predictors in BPD. Conclusions The present study found deficits in MMN, P3a, neurocognition in drug naïve SZ and BPD patients. These deficits appeared to link with levels of higher-order cognition and functioning.

However, it is not known whether their adulthood health and socio-economic sequelae are changing over time. Methods Participants (N = 31 349) are from two prospective national birth cohort studies: 1958 National Child Development Study (n = 16 091) and the 1970 British Cohort Study (n = 15 258). Adolescent mental health was operationalised both as traditional internalising and externalising factors and a hierarchical bi-factor. Associations between adolescent psychopathology and age 42 health and wellbeing (mental health, general health, life satisfaction), social (cohabitation, voting behaviour) and economic (education and employment) outcomes are estimated using linear and logistic multivariable regressions across cohorts, controlling for a wide range of early life potential confounding factors. Results The prevalence of adolescent mental health difficulties increased and their associations with midlife health, wellbeing, social and economic outcomes became more severe or remained similar between those born in 1958 and 1970. For instance, a stronger association with adolescent mental health difficulties was found for those born in 1970 for midlife psychological distress [odds ratio (OR) 1970 = 1.82 (1.65-1.99), OR 1958 = 1.60 (1.43-1.79)], cohabitation [OR 1970 = 0.64 (0.59-0.70), OR 1958 = 0.79 (0.72-0.87)], and professional occupations [OR 1970 = 0.75 (0.67-0.84), OR 1958 = 1.05 (0.88-1.24)]. The associations of externalising symptoms with later outcomes were mainly explained by their shared variance with internalising symptoms. Conclusion The widening of mental health-based inequalities in midlife outcomes further supports the need to recognise that secular increases in adolescent mental health symptoms is a public health challenge with measurable negative consequences through the life-course. Increased public health efforts to minimise adverse outcomes are needed.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Methods Between May and October 2020, we randomised 68 UK participants with mild to moderate low mood to either a 4-week online programme of non-specialist administered BA or to a passive control group. Before and after the intervention, we collected self-report data on mood and COVID-related disruption, as well as measuring emotional cognition as an objective marker of risk for depression. Results In comparison to the control group, the BA group showed a significant decrease in depression, anxiety and anhedonia after the intervention, as well as an increase in self-reported activation and social support. Benefits persisted at 1-month follow-up. BA also decreased negative affective bias on several measures of the Facial Emotion Recognition Task and early change in bias was associated with later therapeutic gain. Participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable. Conclusion This study highlights the benefits of online BA that can be administered by non-specialists after brief training. These findings can help inform the policy response towards the rising incidence of mental health problems during a crisis situation such as a pandemic. They also highlight the use of objective cognitive markers of risk across different treatment modalities.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Data-driven subtyping of this clinically heterogeneous patient population and the associated underlying neural mechanisms are highly needed to identify who will benefit from psychotherapy. Methods In 53 comorbid PTSD/AUD patients, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected prior to undergoing individual psychotherapy. We used a data-driven approach to subgroup patients based on directed connectivity profiles. Connectivity subgroups were compared on clinical measures of PTSD severity and heavy alcohol use collected at pre- and post-treatment. Results We identified a subgroup of patients associated with improvement in PTSD symptoms from integrated-prolonged exposure therapy. This subgroup was characterized by lower insula to inferior parietal cortex (IPC) connectivity, higher pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) to posterior midcingulate cortex connectivity and a unique pgACC to IPC path. We did not observe any connectivity subgroup that uniquely benefited from integrated-coping skills or subgroups associated with change in alcohol consumption. Conclusions Data-driven approaches to characterize PTSD/AUD subtypes have the potential to identify brain network profiles that are implicated in the benefit from psychological interventions - setting the stage for future research that targets these brain circuit communication patterns to boost treatment efficacy.  © United States Department of Veterans Affairs, 2021.","Article","Scopus"

Given the association between the cortiocolimbic system and anxiety, this study aimed to compare developmental trajectories of corticolimbic regions in VP children with and without anxiety diagnosis at 13 years. Methods MRI data from 124 VP children were used to calculate whole brain and corticolimbic region volumes at term-equivalent age (TEA), 7 and 13 years. The presence of an anxiety disorder was assessed at 13 years using a structured clinical interview. Results VP children who met criteria for an anxiety disorder at 13 years (n = 16) displayed altered trajectories for intracranial volume (ICV, p < 0.0001), total brain volume (TBV, p = 0.029), the right amygdala (p = 0.0009) and left hippocampus (p = 0.029) compared with VP children without anxiety (n = 108), with trends in the right hippocampus (p = 0.062) and left medial orbitofrontal cortex (p = 0.079). Altered trajectories predominantly reflected slower growth in early childhood (0-7 years) for ICV (β = -0.461, p = 0.020), TBV (β = -0.503, p = 0.021), left (β = -0.518, p = 0.020) and right hippocampi (β = -0.469, p = 0.020) and left medial orbitofrontal cortex (β = -0.761, p = 0.020) and did not persist after adjusting for TBV and social risk. Conclusions Region- and time-specific alterations in the development of the corticolimbic system in children born VP may help to explain an increase in anxiety disorders observed in this population.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that maternal intake of omega-3 PUFAs is associated with a lower risk of infant maltreatment. Methods Participants were 92 191 mothers involved in the ongoing Japan Environment and Children's Study. Omega-3 PUFA intake during pregnancy was measured using a food frequency questionnaire. Infant maltreatment was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire administered at 1 and 6 months postpartum. Results Analysis using the lowest quintile of intake as a reference revealed that the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cases of 'hitting' decreased as quintiles increased, with values for the second to fifth quintiles of 0.93 (95% CI 0.77-1.13), 0.79 (95% CI 0.64-0.97), 0.78 (95% CI 0.64-0.96), and 0.72 (95% CI 0.59-0.89), respectively. Adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for 'shaking very hard' at 6 months were 0.87 (0.73-1.04), 0.81 (0.67-0.97), 0.73 (0.61-0.89), and 0.78 (0.65-0.94), respectively. Adjusted ORs for 'leaving alone at home' for the second to fifth quintiles were 0.92 (0.87-0.98), 0.91 (0.86-0.97), 0.94 (0.88-0.99), and 0.85 (0.80-0.90), respectively. Conclusions Higher maternal intake of omega-3 PUFAs during pregnancy was associated with fewer cases of hitting and violent shaking and leaving the child alone at home, implying a lower risk of infant maltreatment.

There is a need to develop effective interventions that can be delivered remotely. Previous research has suggested that emotional processing biases are a potential target for intervention, and these may be altered through brief training programs. Methods We report two experimental medicine studies of emotional bias training in two samples: individuals from the general population (n = 522) and individuals currently taking antidepressants to treat anxiety or depression (n = 212). Participants, recruited online, completed four sessions of EBT from their own home. Mental health and cognitive functioning outcomes were assessed at baseline, immediately post-training, and at 2-week follow-up. Results In both studies, our intervention successfully trained participants to perceive ambiguous social information more positively. This persisted at a 2-week follow-up. There was no clear evidence that this change in emotional processing transferred to improvements in symptoms in the primary analyses. However, in both studies, there was weak evidence for improved quality of life following EBT amongst individuals with more depressive symptoms at baseline. No clear evidence of transfer effects was observed for self-reported daily stress, anhedonia or depressive symptoms. Exploratory analyses suggested that younger participants reported greater treatment gains. Conclusions These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of delivering a multi-session online training program to promote lasting cognitive changes. Given the inconsistent evidence for transfer effects, EBT requires further development before it can be considered as a treatment for anxiety and depression.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

We test if an operationalized guided-dose-reduction algorithm can help reach a lower effective dose without increased risks of relapse. Methods A 2-year open-label randomized prospective comparative cohort trial from Aug 2017 to Sep 2022. Patients with a history of schizophrenia-related psychotic disorders under stable medications and symptoms were eligible, randomized 2:1 into guided dose reduction group (GDR) v. maintenance treatment group (MT1), together with a group of naturalistic maintenance controls (MT2). We observed if the relapse rates would be different between 3 groups, to what extent the dose could be reduced, and if GDR patients could have improved functioning and quality of life. Results A total of 96 patients, comprised 51, 24, and 21 patients in GDR, MT1, and MT2 groups, respectively. During follow-up, 14 patients (14.6%) relapsed, including 6, 4, and 4 from GDR, MT1, and MT2, statistically no difference between groups. In total, 74.5% of GDR patients could stay well under a lower dose, including 18 patients (35.3%) conducting 4 consecutive dose-tapering and staying well after reducing 58.5% of their baseline dose. The GDR group exhibited improved clinical outcomes and endorsed better quality of life. Conclusions GDR is a feasible approach as the majority of patients had a chance to taper antipsychotics to certain extents. Still, 25.5% of GDR patients could not successfully decrease any dose, including 11.8% experienced relapse, a risk comparable to their maintenance counterparts.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

We aimed to determine the clinical portrait of such symptom dimensions among individuals in the community. Methods This cross-sectional study consisted of 25 261 self-reported White UK Biobank participants with major depression. Nine questions from the UK Biobank Mental Health Questionnaire encompassing depressive symptoms were decomposed into underlying factors or 'symptom dimensions' via factor analysis, which were then tested for association with psychiatric diagnoses and polygenic risk scores for major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Replication was performed among 655 self-reported non-White participants, across sexes, and among 7190 individuals with an ICD-10 code for MDD from linked inpatient or primary care records. Results Four broad symptom dimensions were identified, encompassing negative cognition, functional impairment, insomnia and atypical symptoms. These dimensions replicated across ancestries, sexes and individuals with inpatient or primary care MDD diagnoses, and were also consistent among 43 090 self-reported White participants with undiagnosed self-reported depression. Every dimension was associated with increased risk of nearly every psychiatric diagnosis and polygenic risk score. However, while certain psychiatric diagnoses were disproportionately associated with specific symptom dimensions, the three polygenic risk scores did not show the same specificity of associations. Conclusions An analysis of questionnaire data from a large community-based cohort reveals four replicable symptom dimensions of depression with distinct clinical, but not genetic, correlates.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Cognitive dysfunction is common, but how it contributes to various functional outcomes in this population has not been well investigated. This study examines how cognition covaries with community functioning and subjective quality of life over a 6-year period while accounting for the effects of risk and protective factors. Methods Participants were 349 homeless adults (mean age = 39.8) recruited from the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez Soi study, a large Canadian randomized control trial of Housing First. Participants completed up to four clinical evaluations over 6 years. Factor scores were created to index verbal learning and memory (vLM) and processing speed-cognitive flexibility (PSCF). The primary outcomes were community functioning and subjective quality of life. Risk factors included lifetime homelessness, mental health diagnoses, medical comorbidity, and childhood adversity. Linear mixed-effects models were conducted to examine cognition-functional outcome associations over time, with resilience as a moderator. Results Better vLM (b = 0.787, p = 0.010) and PSCF (b = 1.66, p < 0.001) were associated with better community functioning, but not with quality of life. Resilience conferred a protective effect on subjective quality of life (b = 1.45, p = 0.011) but did not moderate outcomes. Conclusions Our findings suggest a need to consider the unique determinants of community functioning and quality of life among homeless adults. Cognition should be prioritized as a key intervention target within existing service delivery models to optimize long-term functional outcomes.  © The Author(s), 2021.

As many specific PPS syndromes share common behavioural, cognitive, and affective influences, transdiagnostic treatments might be effective for this patient group. We evaluated the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a therapist-delivered, transdiagnostic cognitive behavioural intervention (TDT-CBT) plus (+) standard medical care (SMC) v. SMC alone for the treatment of patients with PPS in secondary medical care. Methods A two-arm randomised controlled trial, with measurements taken at baseline and at 9, 20, 40- and 52-weeks post randomisation. The primary outcome measure was the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) at 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included mood (PHQ-9 and GAD-7), symptom severity (PHQ-15), global measure of change (CGI), and the Persistent Physical Symptoms Questionnaire (PPSQ). Results We randomised 324 patients and 74% were followed up at 52 weeks. The difference between groups was not statistically significant for the primary outcome (WSAS at 52 weeks: estimated difference -1.48 points, 95% confidence interval from -3.44 to 0.48, p = 0.139). However, the results indicated that some secondary outcomes had a treatment effect in favour of TDT-CBT + SMC with three outcomes showing a statistically significant difference between groups. These were WSAS at 20 weeks (p = 0.016) at the end of treatment and the PHQ-15 (p = 0.013) and CGI at 52 weeks (p = 0.011). Conclusion We have preliminary evidence that TDT-CBT + SMC may be helpful for people with a range of PPS. However, further study is required to maximise or maintain effects seen at end of treatment.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We aim to compare the rates of neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and controls. Method We established a lifetime diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, communication disorders, intellectual disabilities, specific learning disorders, and motor disorders] using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, Present and Lifetime Version in 400 participants (mean age 11.3 + s.d. 3.9 years), including 93 offspring of parents with bipolar disorder, 182 offspring of parents with major depressive disorder, and 125 control offspring of parents with no mood disorder. Results Neurodevelopmental disorders were elevated in offspring of parents with bipolar disorder [odds ratio (OR) 2.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-4.47, p = 0.010] and major depressive disorder (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.03-3.39, p = 0.035) compared to controls. This difference was driven by the rates of ADHD, which were highest among offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (30.1%), intermediate in offspring of parents with major depressive disorder (24.2%), and lowest in controls (14.4%). There were no significant differences in frequencies of other neurodevelopmental disorders between the three groups. Chronic course of mood disorder in parents was associated with higher rates of any neurodevelopmental disorder and higher rates of ADHD in offspring. Conclusions Our findings suggest monitoring for ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring of parents with MDDs may be indicated to improve early diagnosis and treatment.  © The Author(s), 2021.

TCT can be effective in enhancing neurocognition and function in schizophrenia, but such gains require significant time and effort and elude many patients. Methods As a strategy to increase and/or accelerate TCT-induced clinical gains, we tested the dose- and time-course effects of the pro-attentional drug, amphetamine (AMPH; placebo, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg po; within-subject double-blind, order balanced) on auditory learning in schizophrenia patients [n = 32; M:F = 19:13; age 42.0 years (24-55)]. To understand predictors and/or mechanisms of AMPH-enhanced TCT, we also measured auditory fidelity (words-in-noise (WIN), quick speech-in-noise (QuickSIN)) and neurocognition (MATRICS comprehensive cognitive battery (MCCB)). Some measures were also acquired from age-matched healthy subjects (drug free; n = 10; M:F = 5:5). Results Patients exhibited expected deficits in neurocognition. WIN and QuickSIN performance at low signal intensities was impaired in patients with low v. high MCCB attention/vigilance (A/V) scores; these deficits were corrected by AMPH, maximally at 2.5-5 mg (d's = 0.79-1.29). AMPH also enhanced auditory learning, with maximal effects at 5 mg (d = 0.93), and comparable effects 60 and 210 min post pill. 'Pro-learning' effects of AMPH and AMPH-induced gains in auditory fidelity were most evident in patients with low MCCB A/V scores. Conclusions These findings advance our understanding of the impact of pro-attentional interventions on auditory information processing and suggest dose- and time-course parameters for studies that assess the ability of AMPH to enhance the clinical benefits of TCT in schizophrenia patients.

Moreover, the influence of CM severity and frequency was also explored. Methods In total, 187 participants aged 7-17 were assessed for CM history using validated questionnaires and ad hoc interviews to be classified according to the criteria of the Tool for Assessing the Severity of Situations in which Children are Vulnerable (TASSCV). Psychopathology was ascertained using the K-SADS-PL5. To assess HPA-axis functioning, salivary cortisol samples were collected throughout a normal day and during an acute psychosocial stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test for children (TSST-C). Subjective anxiety was evaluated using STAI/-C. Results Youth with a CM history had higher overall diurnal cortisol levels (p = 0.001), blunted cortisol response to acute psychosocial stress (p = 0.002) and greater perceived anxiety (p = 0.003), than those without CM. Specifically, participants exposed to moderate/severe or often/frequent CM showed the greater diurnal cortisol output (pseverity = 0.002; pfrequency = 0.003), and blunted cortisol response during the TSST-C (pseverity = 0.006; pfrequency = 0.008). Meanwhile, youth with low CM severity/frequency exhibited a similar cortisol response to those without CM. However, perceived anxiety was higher in those exposed to CM (p < 0.001), regardless of its severity/frequency. Conclusions Disturbances in HPA-axis functioning are already evident early after CM exposure, while psychological and physiological responses to an acute stressor are dissociated in youth exposed to CM. The dose-response relationship described in this paper highlights the need to comprehensively evaluate CM so that vulnerable children can be identified and assigned to proper interventions.

We investigated the relationships between domains of cognitive functioning and psychopathology in a transdiagnostic sample using a data-driven approach. Methods Cross-sectional network analyses were conducted to investigate the relationships between domains of psychopathology and cognitive functioning and detect clusters in the network. This naturalistic transdiagnostic sample consists of 1016 psychiatric patients who have a variety of psychiatric diagnoses, such as depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Psychopathology symptoms were assessed using various questionnaires. Core cognitive domains were assessed with a battery of automated tests. Results Network analysis detected three clusters that we labelled: general psychopathology, substance use, and cognition. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, verbal memory, and visual attention were the most central nodes in the network. Most associations between cognitive functioning and symptoms were negative, i.e. increased symptom severity was associated with worse cognitive functioning. Cannabis use, (subclinical) psychotic experiences, and anhedonia had the strongest total negative relationships with cognitive variables. Conclusions Cognitive functioning and psychopathology are independent but related dimensions, which interact in a transdiagnostic manner. Depression, anxiety, verbal memory, and visual attention are especially relevant in this network and can be considered independent transdiagnostic targets for research and treatment in psychiatry. Moreover, future research on cognitive functioning in psychopathology should take a transdiagnostic approach, focusing on symptom-specific interactions with cognitive domains rather than investigating cognitive functioning within diagnostic categories.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Neural theories of psychosis pathophysiology suggest that dysfunction worsens with illness stage. Here, we test the hypothesis that hippocampal function is impaired in the early stage of psychosis and declines further over the next 2 years. Methods We measured hippocampal function over 2 years using a scene processing task in 147 participants (76 individuals in the early stage of a non-affective psychotic disorder and 71 demographically similar healthy control individuals). Two-year follow-up was completed in 97 individuals (50 early psychosis, 47 healthy control). Voxelwise longitudinal analysis of activation in response to scenes was carried out within a hippocampal region of interest to test for group differences at baseline and a group by time interaction. Results At baseline, we observed lower anterior hippocampal activation in the early psychosis group relative to the healthy control group. Contrary to our hypothesis, hippocampal activation remained consistent and did not show the predicted decline over 2 years in the early psychosis group. Healthy controls showed a modest reduction in hippocampal activation after 2 years. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that hippocampal dysfunction in early psychosis does not worsen over 2 years and highlight the need for longer-term longitudinal studies.

Yet due to the increasing reports of early sensory processing deficit, recent models focus more on the developmental effects of impaired sensory process on high-order functions. The present study examined whether this pathological interaction relates to an overarching system-level imbalance, specifically a disruption in macroscale hierarchy affecting integration and segregation of unimodal and transmodal networks. Methods We applied a novel combination of connectome gradient and stepwise connectivity analysis to resting-state fMRI to characterize the sensorimotor-to-transmodal cortical hierarchy organization (96 patients v. 122 controls). Results We demonstrated compression of the cortical hierarchy organization in schizophrenia, with a prominent compression from the sensorimotor region and a less prominent compression from the frontal-parietal region, resulting in a diminished separation between sensory and fronto-parietal cognitive systems. Further analyses suggested reduced differentiation related to atypical functional connectome transition from unimodal to transmodal brain areas. Specifically, we found hypo-connectivity within unimodal regions and hyper-connectivity between unimodal regions and fronto-parietal and ventral attention regions along the classical sensation-to-cognition continuum (voxel-level corrected, p < 0.05). Conclusions The compression of cortical hierarchy organization represents a novel and integrative system-level substrate underlying the pathological interaction of early sensory and cognitive function in schizophrenia. This abnormal cortical hierarchy organization suggests cascading impairments from the disruption of the somatosensory-motor system and inefficient integration of bottom-up sensory information with attentional demands and executive control processes partially account for high-level cognitive deficits characteristic of schizophrenia.

The objectives of this study were to present the first cross-national data on the prevalence of NSSI and NSSI disorder among first-year college students and its association with mental disorders. Methods Data come from a survey of the entering class in 24 colleges across nine countries participating in the World Mental Health International College Student (WMH-ICS) initiative assessed in web-based self-report surveys (20 842 first-year students). Using retrospective age-of-onset reports, we investigated time-ordered associations between NSSI and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-IV) mood (major depressive and bipolar disorder), anxiety (generalized anxiety and panic disorder), and substance use disorders (alcohol and drug use disorder). Results NSSI lifetime and 12-month prevalence were 17.7% and 8.4%. A positive screen of 12-month DSM-5 NSSI disorder was 2.3%. Of those with lifetime NSSI, 59.6% met the criteria for at least one mental disorder. Temporally primary lifetime mental disorders predicted subsequent onset of NSSI [median odds ratio (OR) 2.4], but these primary lifetime disorders did not consistently predict 12-month NSSI among respondents with lifetime NSSI. Conversely, even after controlling for pre-existing mental disorders, NSSI consistently predicted later onset of mental disorders (median OR 1.8) as well as 12-month persistence of mental disorders among students with a generalized anxiety disorder (OR 1.6) and bipolar disorder (OR 4.6). Conclusions NSSI is common among first-year college students and is a behavioral marker of various common mental disorders.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

The aim was to examine the association between pre-existing mental health diagnosis and COVID-19 outcomes (positive screen, hospitalization, mortality). Methods Electronic medical record data for 30 976 adults tested for COVID-19 between March 2020 and 10th July 2020 was analyzed. COVID-19 outcomes included positive screen, hospitalization among screened positive, and mortality among screened positive and hospitalized. Primary independent variable, mental health disorders, was based on ICD-10 codes categorized as bipolar, internalizing, externalizing, and psychoses. Descriptive statistics were calculated, unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the relationship between each mental health disorder and COVID-19 outcomes. Results Adults with externalizing (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95%CI 0.57-0.79) and internalizing disorders (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.88) had lower odds of having a positive COVID-19 test in fully adjusted models. Adults with bipolar disorder had significantly higher odds of hospitalization in fully adjusted models (OR 4.27, 95% CI 2.06-8.86), and odds of hospitalization were significantly higher among those with externalizing disorders after adjusting for demographics (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.23-2.38). Mortality was significantly higher in the fully adjusted model for patients with bipolar disorder (hazard ratio 2.67, 95% CI 1.07-6.67). Conclusions Adults with mental health disorders, while less likely to test positive for COVID-19, were more likely to be hospitalized and to die in the hospital. Study results suggest the importance of developing interventions that incorporate elements designed to address smoking cessation, nutrition and physical activity counseling and other needs specific to this population to improve COVID-19 outcomes.

Prior research mainly focused on the hippocampus and amygdala in single diagnostic categories. However, other brain regions may be impacted by trauma as well, and effects may be independent of diagnosis. This cross-sectional study investigated cortical and subcortical gray matter volume in relation to childhood trauma severity. Methods We included 554 participants: 250 bipolar-I patients, 84 schizophrenia-spectrum patients and 220 healthy individuals without a psychiatric history. Participants filled in the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Anatomical T1 MRI scans were acquired at 3T, regional brain morphology was assessed using Freesurfer. Results In the total sample, trauma-related gray matter reductions were found in the frontal lobe (β = -0.049, p = 0.008; q = 0.048), this effect was driven by the right medial orbitofrontal, paracentral, superior frontal regions and the left precentral region. No trauma-related volume reductions were observed in any other (sub)cortical lobes nor the hippocampus or amygdala, trauma-by-group (i.e. both patient groups and healthy subjects) interaction effects were absent. A categorical approach confirmed a pattern of more pronounced frontal gray matter reductions in individuals reporting multiple forms of trauma and across quartiles of cumulative trauma scores. Similar dose-response patterns were revealed within the bipolar and healthy subgroups, but did not reach significance in schizophrenia-spectrum patients. Conclusions Findings show that childhood trauma is linked to frontal gray matter reductions, independent of psychiatric morbidity. Our results indicate that childhood trauma importantly contributes to the neurobiological changes commonly observed across psychiatric disorders. Frontal volume alterations may underpin affective and cognitive disturbances observed in trauma-exposed individuals.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Reviews describing the accuracy of respective questionnaires are available, but their focus on individual questionnaires precludes comparisons across tools. We conducted an overview of systematic reviews to assess the comparative accuracy of informant questionnaires and identify areas where evidence is lacking. Methods We searched six databases to identify systematic reviews describing diagnostic test accuracy of informant questionnaires for cognitive impairment or dementia. We pooled sensitivity and specificity data for each questionnaire and used network approaches to compare accuracy estimates across the differing tests. We used grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) to evaluate the overall certainty of evidence. Finally, we created an evidence 'heat-map', describing the availability of accurate data for individual tests in different populations and settings. Results We identified 25 reviews, consisting of 93 studies and 13 informant questionnaires. Pooled analysis (37 studies; 11 052 participants) ranked the eight-item interview to ascertain dementia (AD8) highest for sensitivity [90%; 95% credible intervals (CrI) = 82-95; 'best-test' probability = 36]; while the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) was most specific (81%; 95% CrI = 66-90; 'best-test' probability = 29%). GRADE-based evaluation of evidence suggested certainty was 'low' overall. Our heat-map indicated that only AD8 and IQCODE have been extensively evaluated and most studies have been in the secondary care settings. Conclusions AD8 and IQCODE appear to be valid questionnaires for cognitive impairment or dementia assessment. Other available informant-based cognitive screening questionnaires lack evidence to justify their use at present. Evidence on the accuracy of available tools in primary care settings and with specific populations is required.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

This study aimed to examine cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of trust in government regarding COVID-19 control with the adoption of recommended health behaviours and prosocial behaviours, and potential determinants of trust in government during the pandemic. Methods This study analysed data from the PsyCorona Survey, an international project on COVID-19 that included 23 733 participants from 23 countries (representative in age and gender distributions by country) at baseline survey and 7785 participants who also completed follow-up surveys. Specification curve analysis was used to examine concurrent associations between trust in government and self-reported behaviours. We further used structural equation model to explore potential determinants of trust in government. Multilevel linear regressions were used to examine associations between baseline trust and longitudinal behavioural changes. Results Higher trust in government regarding COVID-19 control was significantly associated with higher adoption of health behaviours (handwashing, avoiding crowded space, self-quarantine) and prosocial behaviours in specification curve analyses (median standardised β = 0.173 and 0.229, p < 0.001). Government perceived as well organised, disseminating clear messages and knowledge on COVID-19, and perceived fairness were positively associated with trust in government (standardised β = 0.358, 0.230, 0.056, and 0.249, p < 0.01).

An association between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and subsequent depression is clear in adults. We examined associations between individual CVD risk factors and depression in young people. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases from inception to 1 January 2020. We extracted data from cohort studies assessing the longitudinal association between CVD risk factors [body mass index (BMI), smoking, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein] and depression, measured using a validated tool in individuals with mean age of 24 years or younger. Random effect meta-analysis was used to combine effect estimates from individual studies, including odds ratio (OR) for depression and standardised mean difference for depressive symptoms. Results Based on meta-analysis of seven studies, comprising 15 753 participants, high BMI was associated with subsequent depression [pooled OR 1.61; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-2.14; I2 = 31%]. Based on meta-analysis of eight studies, comprising 30 539 participants, smoking was associated with subsequent depression (pooled OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.36-2.20; I2 = 74%). Low, but not high, SBP was associated with an increased risk of depression (pooled OR 3.32; 95% CI 1.68-6.55; I2 = 0%), although this was based on a small pooled high-risk sample of 893 participants. Generalisability may be limited as most studies were based in North America or Europe. Conclusions Targeting childhood/adolescent smoking and obesity may be important for the prevention of both CVD and depression across the lifespan. Further research on other CVD risk factors including blood pressure and cholesterol in young people is required.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Our primary aim was to estimate in the UK adult population the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy explained by blood-injection-injury fears. Methods In total, 15 014 UK adults, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, ethnicity, income and region, took part (19 January-5 February 2021) in a non-probability online survey. The Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale assessed intent to be vaccinated. Two scales (Specific Phobia Scale-blood-injection-injury phobia and Medical Fear Survey-injections and blood subscale) assessed blood-injection-injury fears. Four items from these scales were used to create a factor score specifically for injection fears. Results In total, 3927 (26.2%) screened positive for blood-injection-injury phobia. Individuals screening positive (22.0%) were more likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy compared to individuals screening negative (11.5%), odds ratio = 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.97-2.40, p < 0.001. The population attributable fraction (PAF) indicated that if blood-injection-injury phobia were absent then this may prevent 11.5% of all instances of vaccine hesitancy, AF = 0.11; 95% CI 0.09-0.14, p < 0.001. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was associated with higher scores on the Specific Phobia Scale, r = 0.22, p < 0.001, Medical Fear Survey, r = 0.23, p = <0.001 and injection fears, r = 0.25, p < 0.001. Injection fears were higher in youth and in Black and Asian ethnic groups, and explained a small degree of why vaccine hesitancy is higher in these groups. Conclusions Across the adult population, blood-injection-injury fears may explain approximately 10% of cases of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Addressing such fears will likely improve the effectiveness of vaccination programmes.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

These findings prompted our investigation of treating pathological fear using this non-invasive stimulation approach either alone to the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), or to the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) in combination with exposure therapy. Methods Volunteers with pathological fear of either enclosed spaces, contamination, public speaking, or anxiety-related bodily sensations were recruited for this randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled trial with four arms: (a) Exposure + TILS_vmPFC (n = 29), (b) Exposure + sham TILS_vmPFC (n = 29), (c) TILS_dlPFC alone (n = 26), or (d) Sham TILS _dlPFC alone (n = 28). Post-treatment assessments occurred immediately following treatment. Follow-up assessments occurred 2 weeks after treatment. Results A total of 112 participants were randomized [age range: 18-63 years; 96 females (85.71%)]. Significant interactions of Group × Time and Group × Context indicated differential treatment effects on retention (i.e. between time-points, averaged across contexts) and on generalization (i.e. between contexts, averaged across time-points), respectively. Among the monotherapies, TILS_dlPFC outperformed SHAM_dlPFC in the initial context, b = -13.44, 95% CI (-25.73 to -1.15), p = 0.03. Among the combined treatments, differences between EX + TILS_vmPFC and EX + SHAM_vmPFC were non-significant across all contrasts. Conclusions TILS to the dlPFC, one of the PFC regions implicated in emotion regulation, resulted in a context-specific benefit as a monotherapy for reducing fear. Contrary to prediction, TILS to the vmPFC, a region implicated in fear extinction memory consolidation, did not enhance exposure therapy outcome.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

The first COVID-19 national lockdown led to an increasing reliance on home-carers and we investigate the short- and longer-term impacts of lockdown on their mental health. Methods Data from 9737 adult participants (aged 16+) from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (Understanding Society) were used to explore changes in 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) score between (a) pre-pandemic (2019) and early lockdowns (April 2020) and (b) early and later (July 2020) lockdowns. Results GHQ-12 scores among home-carers were higher pre-lockdown and increased more than for non-carers from 2019 to April 2020 with further increases for home-carers compared with non-carers between April and July. Compared with respondents caring for a spouse/partner, those caring for a child under 18 had a particularly marked increase in GHQ-12 score between 2019 and April, as did those caring for someone with a learning disability. Home-carers of children under 18 improved from April to July while those caring for adult children saw a marked worsening of their mental health. Home-carers with greater care burden saw larger increases in GHQ-12 score from 2019 to April and from April to July, and increases through both periods were greater for home-carers who had formal help prior to lockdown but then lost it. Conclusions The mental health of home-carers deteriorated more during lockdown than non-carers. Policies that reinstate support for them and their care-recipients will benefit the health of both vulnerable groups.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

This meta-analysis provides a quantitative synthesis of literature on transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology to evaluate the validity of the HiTOP framework. Methods Published studies estimating factor-analytic models from diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM) diagnoses were screened. A total of 120,596 participants from 35 studies assessing 23 DSM diagnoses were included in the meta-analytic models. Data were pooled into a meta-analytic correlation matrix using a random effects model. Exploratory factor analyses were conducted using the pooled correlation matrix. A hierarchical structure was estimated by extracting one to five factors representing levels of the HiTOP framework, then calculating congruence coefficients between factors at sequential levels. Results Five transdiagnostic dimensions fit the DSM diagnoses well (comparative fit index = 0.92, root mean square error of approximation = 0.07, and standardized root-mean-square residual = 0.03). Most diagnoses had factor loadings >|0.30| on the expected factors, and congruence coefficients between factors indicated a hierarchical structure consistent with the HiTOP framework. Conclusions A model closely resembling the HiTOP framework fit the data well and placement of DSM diagnoses within transdiagnostic dimensions were largely confirmed, supporting it as valid structure for conceptualizing and organizing psychopathology. Results also suggest transdiagnostic research should (1) use traits, narrow symptoms, and dimensional measures of psychopathology instead of DSM diagnoses, (2) assess a broader array of constructs, and (3) increase focus on understudied pathologies.  © The Author(s), 2021.

We compared cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) each to an individual psychotherapy comparator group, and CPT to PE in a large national healthcare system. Methods We utilized effectiveness and comparative effectiveness emulated trials using retrospective cohort data from electronic medical records. Participants were veterans with PTSD initiating mental healthcare (N = 265 566). The primary outcome was PTSD symptoms measured by the PTSD Checklist (PCL) at baseline and 24-week follow-up. Emulated trials were comprised of 'person-trials,' representing 112 discrete 24-week periods of care (10/07-6/17) for each patient. Treatment group comparisons were made with generalized linear models, utilizing propensity score matching and inverse probability weights to account for confounding, selection, and non-adherence bias. Results There were 636 CPT person-trials matched to 636 non-EBP person-trials. Completing ≥8 CPT sessions was associated with a 6.4-point greater improvement on the PCL (95% CI 3.1-10.0). There were 272 PE person-trials matched to 272 non-EBP person-trials. Completing ≥8 PE sessions was associated with a 9.7-point greater improvement on the PCL (95% CI 5.4-13.8). There were 232 PE person-trials matched to 232 CPT person-trials. Those completing ≥8 PE sessions had slightly greater, but not statistically significant, improvement on the PCL (8.3-points; 95% CI 5.9-10.6) than those completing ≥8 CPT sessions (7.0-points; 95% CI 5.5-8.5).

Methods The random-intercept cross-lagged panel model decomposes observed variables into a latent intercept representing the traits, and occasion-specific latent 'state' variables. This permits correlations to be assessed between the traits, while longitudinal 'cross-lagged' associations and cross-sectional correlations can be assessed between occasion-specific latent variables. We examined dynamic relationships between depressive symptoms and insulin resistance across five visits over 20 years of adulthood in the population-based Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. Possible differences based on population group (Black v. White participants), sex and years of education were tested. Depressive symptoms and insulin resistance were quantified using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale and the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), respectively. Results Among 4044 participants (baseline mean age 34.9 ± 3.7 years, 53% women, 51% Black participants), HOMA-IR and CES-D traits were weakly correlated (r = 0.081, p = 0.002). Some occasion-specific correlations, but no cross-lagged associations were observed overall. Longitudinal dynamics of these relationships differed by population groups such that HOMA-IR at age 50 was associated with CES-D score at age 55 (β = 0.076, p = 0.038) in White participants only. Longitudinal dynamics were consistent between sexes and based on education. Conclusions The relationship between depressive symptoms and insulin resistance was best characterized by weak correlations between occasion-specific states and enduring traits, with weak evidence that insulin resistance might be temporally associated with subsequent depressive symptoms among White participants later in adulthood.

Early intervention efforts need to focus on subgroups of the population who are more likely to transition from ideation to suicidal plans and attempts. The current study utilised data from a large nationally representative sample to investigate the time taken to transition and the demographic and mental health correlates of transitioning to suicidal plans and attempts among those with suicidal ideation. Methods Data were from 1237 Australians aged 16-85 years who reported suicidal thoughts at some point in their life. Discrete time survival analysis was used to retrospectively examine the time in years and correlates of transitioning from suicidal ideation to suicide plans and suicide attempt. Results The majority of those who transitioned to suicide plans or attempts typically did so within 2 years of first experiencing suicidal ideation. Several factors were independently associated with increased speed to transition, including alcohol use disorder, drug use disorder, major depressive episode, obsessive compulsive disorder, sexual minority status, and non-urban location. Older age, being male, older age of first ideation and greater family support were associated with a slower transition. Conclusion The current study suggests that pre-existing mental or substance use disorders, particularly drug use disorder, as well as sexual minority status, sex and greater family support play an important role in the transition from suicidal ideation to plans or attempts. These results highlight the potential importance of suicide prevention programs that aim to improve social connectedness.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

This study aimed to conduct a randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of long-term psychotherapy for rehabilitating offenders with PDs. Methods We compared schema therapy (ST), an evidence-based psychotherapy for PDs, to treatment-as-usual (TAU) at eight high-security forensic hospitals in the Netherlands. Patients in both conditions received multiple treatment modalities and differed only in the individual, study-specific therapy they received. One-hundred-three male offenders with antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, or paranoid PDs, or Cluster B PD-not-otherwise-specified, were assigned to 3 years of ST or TAU and assessed every 6 months. Primary outcomes were rehabilitation, involving gradual reintegration into the community, and PD symptoms. Results Patients in both conditions showed moderate to large improvements in outcomes. ST was superior to TAU on both primary outcomes - rehabilitation (i.e. attaining supervised and unsupervised leave) and PD symptoms - and six of nine secondary outcomes, with small to moderate advantages over TAU. ST patients moved more rapidly through rehabilitation (supervised leave, treatment*time: F(5308) = 9.40, p < 0.001; unsupervised leave, treatment*time: F(5472) = 3.45, p = 0.004), and showed faster improvements on PD scales (treatment*time: t(1387) = -2.85, p = 0.005). Conclusions These findings contradict pessimistic views on the treatability of violent offenders with PDs, and support the effectiveness of long-term psychotherapy for rehabilitating these patients, facilitating their re-entry into the community.

Numerous environmental factors have been identified; however, the individual effects are small. The additive and interactive effects of multiple risk factors are not well elucidated. Twin pairs discordant for schizophrenia offer a unique opportunity to identify factors that differ between patients and unaffected co-twins, who are perfectly matched for age, sex and genetic background. Methods Register data were combined with clinical data for 216 twins including monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) proband pairs (one or both twins having a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis) and MZ/DZ healthy control (HC) pairs. Logistic regression models were applied to predict (1) illness vulnerability (being a proband v. HC pair) and (2) illness status (being the patient v. unaffected co-twin). Risk factors included: A polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia, birth complications, birth weight, Apgar scores, paternal age, maternal smoking, season of birth, parental socioeconomic status, urbanicity, childhood trauma, estimated premorbid intelligence and cannabis. Results The PRS [odds ratio (OR) 1.6 (1.1-2.3)], childhood trauma [OR 4.5 (2.3-8.8)], and regular cannabis use [OR 8.3 (2.1-32.7)] independently predicted illness vulnerability as did an interaction between childhood trauma and cannabis use [OR 0.17 (0.03-0.9)]. Only regular cannabis use predicted having a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis between patients and unaffected co-twins [OR 3.3 (1.1-10.4)]. Conclusion The findings suggest that several risk factors contribute to increasing schizophrenia spectrum vulnerability. Moreover, cannabis, a potentially completely avoidable environmental risk factor, seems to play a substantial role in schizophrenia pathology.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a amplitude reflect an individual's detection and subsequent change in attention to stimulus change in their environment. Our primary aim was to explore MMN and P3a amplitude in adult ADHD patients and to examine the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) on these measures. Methods Forty initially psychostimulant-naïve, adult ADHD patients without comorbid ASD and 42 matched healthy controls (HC) were assessed with an MMN paradigm at baseline. Both groups were retested after 6 weeks, in which patients were treated with MPH. Results Neither significant group differences in MMN nor P3a amplitude were found at baseline. Although 6-week MPH treatment significantly reduced symptomatology and improved daily functioning of the patients, it did not significantly affect MMN amplitude; however, it did significantly reduce P3a amplitude compared to the HC. Furthermore, more severe ADHD symptoms were significantly associated with larger MMN amplitudes in the patients, both at baseline and follow-up. Conclusion We found no evidence for early information processing deficits in patients with ADHD, as measured with MMN and P3a amplitude. Six-week treatment with MPH decreased P3a but not MMN amplitude, although more severe ADHD-symptoms were associated with larger MMN amplitudes in the patients. Given that P3a amplitude represents an important attentional process and that glutamate has been linked to both ADHD and MMN amplitude, future research should investigate augmenting MPH treatment of less responsive adults with ADHD with glutamatergic antagonists.

It is unclear whether comorbid pain also is associated with a poorer response to treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Methods 162 MDD subjects received 30 sessions of 10 Hz rTMS treatment administered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with depression and pain symptoms measured before and after treatment. For a subset of 96 patients, a resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded at baseline. Clinical outcome was compared between subjects with and without comorbid pain, and the relationships among outcome, pain severity, individual peak alpha frequency (PAF), and PAF phase-coherence in the EEG were examined. Results 64.8% of all subjects reported pain, and both depressive and pain symptoms were significantly reduced after rTMS treatment, irrespective of age or gender. Patients with severe pain were 27% less likely to respond to MDD treatment than pain-free individuals. PAF was positively associated with pain severity. PAF phase-coherence in the somatosensory and default mode networks was significantly lower for MDD subjects with pain who failed to respond to MDD treatment. Conclusions Pain symptoms improved after rTMS to left DLPFC in MDD irrespective of age or gender, although the presence of chronic pain symptoms reduced the likelihood of treatment response. Individual PAF and baseline phase-coherence in the sensorimotor and midline regions may represent predictors of rTMS treatment outcome in comorbid pain and MDD.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Given the vital role of the hippocampus in memory, a prime candidate for investigation is whether total and/or subfield hippocampal volume can serve as biological markers of dissociative amnesia. Methods A total of 75 women, 32 with DID and 43 matched healthy controls (HC), underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using Freesurfer (version 6.0), volumes were extracted for bilateral global hippocampus, cornu ammonis (CA) 1-4, the granule cell molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG), fimbria, hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area (HATA), parasubiculum, presubiculum and subiculum. Analyses of covariance showed volumetric differences between DID and HC. Partial correlations exhibited relationships between the three factors of the dissociative experience scale scores (dissociative amnesia, absorption, depersonalisation/derealisation) and traumatisation measures with hippocampal global and subfield volumes. Results Hippocampal volumes were found to be smaller in DID as compared with HC in bilateral global hippocampus and bilateral CA1, right CA4, right GC-ML-DG, and left presubiculum. Dissociative amnesia was the only dissociative symptom that correlated uniquely and significantly with reduced bilateral hippocampal CA1 subfield volumes. Regarding traumatisation, only emotional neglect correlated negatively with bilateral global hippocampus, bilateral CA1, CA4 and GC-ML-DG, and right CA3. Conclusion We propose decreased CA1 volume as a biomarker for dissociative amnesia. We also propose that traumatisation, specifically emotional neglect, is interlinked with dissociative amnesia in having a detrimental effect on hippocampal volume.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

This study investigates the impact of age and sex on the point prevalence across different mood and anxiety disorders, internalizing symptoms, and neuroticism. Methods We used cross-sectional data on 146 315 subjects, aged 18-80 years, from the Lifelines Cohort Study, a Dutch general population sample. Between 2012 and 2016, five current internalizing disorders - major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and panic disorder - were assessed according to DSM-IV criteria. Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, neuroticism, and negative affect (NA) were also measured. Generalized additive models were used to identify nonlinear patterns across age, and to investigate sex differences. Results The point prevalence of internalizing disorders generally increased between the ages of 18 and 30 years, stabilized between 30 and 50, and decreased after age 50. The patterns of internalizing symptoms and traits were different. NA and neuroticism gradually decreased after age 18. Women reported more internalizing disorders than men, but the relative difference remained stable across age (relative risk ~1.7). Conclusions The point prevalence of internalizing disorders was typically highest between age 30 and 50, but there were differences between the disorders, which could indicate differences in etiology. The relative gap between the sexes remained similar across age, suggesting that changes in sex hormones around the menopause do not significantly influence women's risk of internalizing disorders.

Methods To assess the causal impact of COVID-19 on psychological changes in China, we constructed a city-level panel data set based on the expressed sentiment in the contents of 13 million geotagged tweets on Sina Weibo, the Chinese largest microblog platform. Results Applying a difference-in-differences approach, we found a significant deterioration in mental health status after the occurrence of COVID-19. We also observed that this psychological effect faded out over time during our study period and was more pronounced among women, teenagers and older adults. The mental health impact was more likely to be observed in cities with low levels of initial mental health status, economic development, medical resources and social security.

However, valid causal inference from sibling studies is subject to challenges inherent to human studies of MSP and biases particular to this design. We addressed these challenges in the first sibling study of MSP and depression conducted among adults past the peak age for the onset of depression, utilizing a prospectively collected and biologically validated measure of MSP and accounting for non-shared as well as mediating factors. Methods We fit GEE binomial regression models to correct for dependence in the risk of depression across pregnancies of the same mother. We also fit marginal structural models (MSM) to estimate the controlled direct effect of MSP on depression that is not mediated by the offspring's smoking status. Both models allow the estimation of within- and between-sibling risk ratios. Results The adjusted within-sibling risk ratios (RRW) from both models (GEE: RRW = 1.97, CI 1.16-3.32; MSM: RRW = 2.08, CI 1.04-4.17) evinced an independent association between MSP and risk of depression. The overall effects from a standard model evinced lower associations (GEE: RRT = 1.12, CI 0.98-1.28; MSM: RRT = 1.18, CI 1.01-1.37). Conclusions Based on within-sibling information free of unmeasured shared confounders and accounting for a range of unshared factors, we found an effect of MSP on the offspring's risk of depression. Our findings, should they be replicated in future studies, highlight the importance of considering challenges inherent to human studies of MSP and affective disorders.

This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the MINI-7 psychosis items in a sample of 8609 participants across four countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods We examined the latent factor structure and the item difficulty of the MINI-7 psychosis items in the full sample and across four countries. Results Multiple group confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) revealed an adequate fitting unidimensional model for the full sample; however, single group CFAs at the country level revealed that the underlying latent structure of psychosis was not invariant. Specifically, although the unidimensional structure was an adequate model fit for Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa, it was a poor fit for Uganda. Instead, a 2-factor latent structure of the MINI-7 psychosis items provided the optimal fit for Uganda. Examination of item difficulties revealed that MINI-7 item K7, measuring visual hallucinations, had the lowest difficulty across the four countries. In contrast, the items with the highest difficulty were different across the four countries, suggesting that MINI-7 items that are the most predictive of being high on the latent factor of psychosis are different for each country.

In this study, we set out to assess the clinical features and outcomes of patients with current psychiatric disorders exposed to COVID-19. Methods This multi-center prospective study was conducted in 22 psychiatric wards dedicated to COVID-19 inpatients between 28 February and 30 May 2020. The main outcomes were the number of patients transferred to somatic care units, the number of deaths, and the number of patients developing a confusional state. The risk factors of confusional state and transfer to somatic care units were assessed by a multivariate logistic model. The risk of death was analyzed by a univariate analysis. Results In total, 350 patients were included in the study. Overall, 24 (7%) were transferred to medicine units, 7 (2%) died, and 51 (15%) patients presented a confusional state. Severe respiratory symptoms predicted the transfer to a medicine unit [odds ratio (OR) 17.1; confidence interval (CI) 4.9-59.3]. Older age, an organic mental disorder, a confusional state, and severe respiratory symptoms predicted mortality in univariate analysis. Age >55 (OR 4.9; CI 2.1-11.4), an affective disorder (OR 4.1; CI 1.6-10.9), and severe respiratory symptoms (OR 4.6; CI 2.2-9.7) predicted a higher risk, whereas smoking (OR 0.3; CI 0.1-0.9) predicted a lower risk of a confusional state. Conclusion COVID-19 patients with severe psychiatric disorders have multiple somatic comorbidities and have a risk of developing a confusional state. These data underline the need for extreme caution given the risks of COVID-19 in patients hospitalized for psychiatric disorders.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Precise and powerful estimates of digital intervention effectiveness for anxiety disorders are necessary for further adoption in practice. The present systematic review and meta-analysis examined the effectiveness of digital interventions across all anxiety disorders and specific to each disorder v. wait-list and care-as-usual controls. Methods A systematic search of bibliographic databases identified 15 030 abstracts from inception to 1 January 2020. Forty-seven randomized controlled trials (53 comparisons; 4958 participants) contributed to the meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted by an anxiety disorder, risk of bias, treatment support, recruitment, location and treatment adherence. Results A large, pooled effect size of g = 0.80 [95% Confidence Interval: 0.68-0.93] was found in favor of digital interventions. Moderate to large pooled effect sizes favoring digital interventions were found for generalized anxiety disorder (g = 0.62), mixed anxiety samples (g = 0.68), panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (g = 1.08) and social anxiety disorder (g = 0.76) subgroups. No subgroups were significantly different or related to the pooled effect size. Notably, the effects of guided interventions (g = 0.84) and unguided interventions (g = 0.64) were not significantly different. Supplemental analysis comparing digital and face-to-face interventions (9 comparisons; 683 participants) found no significant difference in effect [g = 0.14 favoring digital interventions; Confidence Interval: -0.01 to 0.30]. Conclusion The precise and powerful estimates found further justify the application of digital interventions for anxiety disorders in place of wait-list or usual care.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Neuron-specific enolase (NSE), mainly located in the neuronal cytoplasm, may indicate the process as it is upregulated after neuronal injury while a switch from non-neuronal enolase to NSE occurs during neuronal maturation. Methods We included 1132 adult patients with SMI [schizophrenia (SZ) or bipolar spectrum disorders], 903 adult healthy controls (HC), 32 adolescent patients with SMI and 67 adolescent HC. Plasma NSE concentrations were measured by enzyme immunoassay. For 842 adults and 85 adolescents, we used total grey matter volume (TGMV) based on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images processed in FreeSurfer v6.0. We explored NSE case-control differences in adults and adolescents separately. To investigate whether putative case-control differences in NSE were TGMV-dependent we controlled for TGMV. Results We found significantly lower NSE concentrations in both adult (p < 0.001) and adolescent patients with SMI (p = 0.007) compared to HC. The results remained significant after controlling for TGMV. Among adults, both patients with SZ spectrum (p < 0.001) and bipolar spectrum disorders (p = 0.005) had lower NSE than HC. In both patient subgroups, lower NSE levels were associated with increased symptom severity. Among adults (p < 0.001) and adolescents (p = 0.040), females had lower NSE concentrations than males. Conclusion We found lower NSE concentrations in adult and adolescent patients with SMI compared to HC. The results suggest the lack of progressive neuronal injury, and may reflect abnormal neuronal maturation. This provides further support of a neurodevelopmental rather than a neurodegenerative mechanism in SMI.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

The aim of this study was to examine the combined effect of Type D personality and depression on clinical outcomes in patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods This prospective cohort study included 3568 patients diagnosed with AMI between February 2017 and September 2018. Type D personality and depression were assessed at baseline, while the major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rate (cardiac death, recurrent non-fatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, and stroke) and in-stent restenosis (ISR) rate were analyzed after a 2-year follow-up period. Results A total of 437 patients developed MACEs and 185 had ISR during the follow-up period. The Type D (+) depression (+) and Type D (+) depression (-) groups had a higher risk of MACE [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.74-6.07] (95% CI 1.25-2.96) and ISR (95% CI 3.09-8.28) (95% CI 1.85-6.22). Analysis of Type D and depression as continuous variables indicated that the main effect of Type D, depression and their combined effect were significantly associated with MACE and ISR. Moreover, Type D (+) depression (+) and Type D (+) depression (-) emerged as significant risk factors for MACE and ISR in males, while only Type D (+) depression (+) was associated with MACE and ISR in female patients. Conclusions These findings suggest that patients complicated with depression and Type D personality are at a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Individual assessments of Type D personality and depression, and comprehensive interventions are required.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

We explored the risk of dementia in Scottish military veterans aged up to 73 years in comparison with people who have never served. Methods Retrospective cohort study of 78 000 veterans and 253 000 people with no record of service, matched for age, sex and area of residence, with up to 37 years follow-up, using Cox proportional hazard analysis to compare risk of dementia in veterans and non-veterans, overall and by subgroup. Results Dementia was recorded in 0.2% of both veterans and non-veterans overall, Cox proportional hazard ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-1.19, p = 0.879 (landmark age: 50 years), with no difference for men but increased risk in veteran women and Early Service Leavers. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was associated with a higher risk of dementia in both veterans and non-veterans, although possibly to a lesser degree in veterans. A history of mood disorder was strongly associated with developing dementia, greater in veterans than in non-veterans, odds ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.01-2.35, p = 0.045. Conclusions There was no evidence to suggest that military service increased the risk of dementia, although this may change as the cohort ages. The well-documented association with PTSD shows no evidence of being stronger in veterans; by contrast, the association of mood disorder with dementia is much stronger in veterans. Healthcare providers should carefully assess the cognitive status of older veterans presenting with depressive illness in order to identify early dementia and ensure optimum management.

We evaluated pandemic-related psychopathology and psychiatry diagnoses and their determinants in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Health (ELSA-Brasil) São Paulo Research Center. Methods Between pre-pandemic ELSA-Brasil assessments in 2008-2010 (wave-1), 2012-2014 (wave-2), 2016-2018 (wave-3) and three pandemic assessments in 2020 (COVID-19 waves in May-July, July-September, and October-December), rates of common psychiatric symptoms, and depressive, anxiety, and common mental disorders (CMDs) were compared using the Clinical Interview Scheduled-Revised (CIS-R) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Multivariable generalized linear models, adjusted by age, gender, educational level, and ethnicity identified variables associated with an elevated risk for mental disorders. Results In 2117 participants (mean age 62.3 years, 58.2% females), rates of CMDs and depressive disorders did not significantly change over time, oscillating from 23.5% to 21.1%, and 3.3% to 2.8%, respectively; whereas rate of anxiety disorders significantly decreased (2008-2010: 13.8%; 2016-2018: 9.8%; 2020: 8%). There was a decrease along three wave-COVID assessments for depression [β = -0.37, 99.5% confidence interval (CI) -0.50 to -0.23], anxiety (β = -0.37, 99.5% CI -0.48 to -0.26), and stress (β = -0.48, 99.5% CI -0.64 to -0.33) symptoms (all ps < 0.001). Younger age, female sex, lower educational level, non-white ethnicity, and previous psychiatric disorders were associated with increased odds for psychiatric disorders, whereas self-evaluated good health and good quality of relationships with decreased risk. Conclusion No consistent evidence of pandemic-related worsening psychopathology in our cohort was found. Indeed, psychiatric symptoms slightly decreased along 2020. Risk factors representing socioeconomic disadvantages were associated with increased odds of psychiatric disorders.  © The Author(s), 2021.

We captured the co-development of teacher-rated externalizing and internalizing problems at age 6-12 using multitrajectories. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule administered at age 15 and 22, we identified individuals (1) who never experienced suicidal ideation/attempts, (2) experienced suicidal ideation but never attempted suicide and (3) attempted suicide. Results The identified profiles were no/low problems (45%), externalizing (29%), internalizing (11%) and comorbid problems (13%). After adjusting for socioeconomic and familial characteristics, children with externalizing (OR 2.00, CI 1.39-2.88), internalizing (OR 2.34, CI 1.51-3.64) and comorbid (OR 3.29, CI 2.05-5.29) problems were at higher risk of attempting suicide (v. non-suicidal) by age 22 than those with low/no problems. Females with comorbid problems were at higher risk of attempting suicide than females with one problem. Childhood problems were not associated with suicidal ideation. Externalizing (OR 2.01, CI 1.29-3.12) and comorbid problems (OR 2.28, CI 1.29-4.03) distinguished individuals who attempted suicide from those who thought about suicide without attempting. Conclusion Childhood externalizing problems alone or combined with internalizing problems were associated with suicide attempts, but not ideation (without attempts), suggesting that these problems confer a specific risk for suicide attempts.

This is regarded as an emotion regulation strategy with adverse long-term effects implicated in disorder maintenance and treatment resistance. Therefore, we aimed to examine neural correlates of food/body-related AM-recall in AN. Methods Twenty-nine female patients with AN and 30 medication-free age-sex-matched normal-weight healthy controls (HC) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while recalling AMs in response to food/body-related and neutral cue words. To control for general knowledge retrieval, participants engaged in a semantic generation and riser detection task. Results In comparison to HC, patients with AN generated fewer and less specific AMs in response to food/body-related words, but not for neutral cue words. Group comparisons revealed reduced activation in regions associated with self-referential processing and memory retrieval (precuneus and angular gyrus) during the retrieval of specific food/body-related AM in patients with AN. Brain connectivity in regions associated with memory functioning and executive control was reduced in patients with AN during the retrieval of specific food/body-related AM. Finally, resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed no differences between groups, arguing against a general underlying disconnection of brain networks implicated in memory and emotional processing in AN. Conclusions These results indicate impaired neural processing of food/body-related AM in AN, with a reduced involvement of regions involved in self-referential processing. Our findings are discussed as possible neuronal correlates of emotional avoidance in AN and provide new insights of AN-pathophysiology underscoring the importance of targeting dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies during treatment.

This strong association may reflect a shared pathophysiology in the form of altered autonomic activity and increased reactivity. Using an acoustic startle paradigm, we investigated the interrelationships of psychophysiological measures during wakefulness and PTSD diagnosis, posttraumatic nightmares, and nontraumatic nightmares. Methods A community sample of 122 trauma survivors were presented with a series of brief loud tones, while heart rate (HRR), skin conductance (SCR), and orbicularis oculi electromyogram (EMGR) responses were measured. Prior to the tone presentations, resting heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed. Nightmares were measured using nightmare logs. Three dichotomous groupings of participants were compared: (1) current PTSD diagnosis (n = 59), no PTSD diagnosis (n = 63), (2) those with (n = 26) or without (n = 96) frequent posttraumatic nightmares, and (3) those with (n = 22) or without (n = 100) frequent nontraumatic nightmares. Results PTSD diagnosis was associated with posttraumatic but not with nontraumatic nightmares. Both PTSD and posttraumatic nightmares were associated with a larger mean HRR to loud tones, whereas nontraumatic nightmare frequency was associated with a larger SCR. EMGR and resting HRV were not associated with PTSD diagnosis or nightmares. Conclusions Our findings suggest a shared pathophysiology between PTSD and posttraumatic nightmares in the form of increased HR reactivity to startling tones, which might reflect reduced parasympathetic tone. This shared pathophysiology could explain why PTSD is more strongly related to posttraumatic than nontraumatic nightmares, which could have important clinical implications.

However, associations of these impairments with disturbances in social, cognitive, and affective brain networks remain uninvestigated. Methods The present study examined patterns of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in a sample of 74 age- and sex-matched participants (45 inpatients with PD and 29 healthy controls). At a minimum, PD patients carried a diagnosis of borderline PD, although the majority of the sample had one or more additional PDs. rsFC patterns in the following networks were compared between groups and in association with dimensional personality impairments: default mode network (DMN)/core mentalization, frontolimbic, salience, and central executive. Further, the extent to which variation in rsFC was explained by levels of personality impairment as compared to typology-specific borderline PD symptom severity was explored. Results Relative to controls, the PD group showed disruptions in rsFC within the DMN/core mentalization and frontolimbic networks. Among PD patients, greater severity of dimensional self-interpersonal impairment was associated with stronger intralimbic rsFC. In contrast, severity of borderline PD-specific typology was not associated with any rsFC patterns. Conclusions Disruptions in core mentalization and affective networks are present in PD. Higher intralimbic functional connectivity may underlie self-interpersonal personality impairment in PD regardless of diagnostic typology-specific PD symptoms, providing initial neurobiological evidence supporting alternative dimensional conceptualizations of personality pathology.  © The Author(s), 2021.

However, the mechanisms through which a mother's experience of ACEs are transmitted to her offspring are understudied. The current study investigates potential modifiable mediators (maternal psychopathology and parenting) of the association between maternal ACEs and children's behavioral problems. Methods We utilized data from a pregnancy cohort study (N = 1030; CANDLE study) to investigate longitudinal associations between maternal ACEs, postpartum anxiety, observed parenting behavior, and child internalizing behaviors (meanage = 4.31 years, s.d.age = 0.38) in a racially diverse (67% Black; 33% White/Other) sample. We used structural equation modeling to test for direct associations between maternal ACEs and children's internalizing behaviors, as well as indirect associations via two simple mediations (maternal anxiety and parenting), and one serial mediation (sequence of maternal anxiety to parenting). Results Simple mediation results indicated that maternal anxiety and cognitive growth fostering behaviors independently mediated the association between maternal ACEs and child internalizing. We observed no evidence of a serial mediation from ACEs to internalizing via the effects of maternal anxiety on parenting. Conclusions This study supports and refines extant literature by confirming the intergenerational association between maternal ACEs and child internalizing behaviors in a large, diverse sample, and identifies potential modifiable mediators: maternal anxiety and parenting behaviors related to fostering cognitive development. Findings may inform interventions targeting mothers who have experienced ACEs and suggest that providing support around specific parenting behaviors and addressing maternal anxiety may reduce internalizing behaviors in children.

Cognitive remediation (CR) is a psychological therapy targeting cognitive and functioning difficulties. Recent evidence suggests that CR may enhance long-term functioning but transfer mechanisms on functional outcomes have not been explored. We aim to investigate whether and how cognitive gains after CR transfer to functional improvement. Methods We considered data from a randomized controlled trial comparing CR (n = 40) to treatment-as-usual (TAU; n = 40) in euthymic people with BD. Treatment outcomes included individual cognitive domains and global cognition, psychosocial functioning, and goal attainment. Regression-based mediation and moderation modelling were used to assess whether and how post-treatment cognitive changes translate into functional improvement at follow-up, three months after treatment end. Results Cognitive gains after CR transferred to functional changes three months later: improvement in post-treatment global cognition partially mediated the effect of CR on psychosocial functioning (standardized indirect effect: -0.23, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.04). Goal attainment was not significantly mediated by changes in cognition, but post-treatment cognitive performance moderated the effect of CR on the GAS at follow-up (interaction effect: 0.78, 95% CI 0.08-1.55). Conclusions Our findings suggest that cognitive improvements contribute to functional improvement but transfer mechanisms differ between psychosocial functioning and idiosyncratic recovery goals. Cognition accounted for only a proportion of the total CR effect on functional outcomes. Future studies should consider other variables, such as metacognition, that may drive the transfer of CR effects to functional outcomes.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

An earlier report showed that high-risk U.S. Army soldiers could be identified shortly before this transition with a machine learning model that included predictors from administrative systems, self-report surveys, and geospatial data. Based on this result, a Veterans Affairs and Army initiative was launched to evaluate a suicide-prevention intervention for high-risk transitioning soldiers. To make targeting practical, though, a streamlined model and risk calculator were needed that used only a short series of self-report survey questions. Methods We revised the original model in a sample of n = 8335 observations from the Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers-Longitudinal Study (STARRS-LS) who participated in one of three Army STARRS 2011-2014 baseline surveys while in service and in one or more subsequent panel surveys (LS1: 2016-2018, LS2: 2018-2019) after leaving service. We trained ensemble machine learning models with constrained numbers of item-level survey predictors in a 70% training sample. The outcome was self-reported post-transition suicide attempts (SA). The models were validated in the 30% test sample. Results Twelve-month post-transition SA prevalence was 1.0% (s.e. = 0.1). The best constrained model, with only 17 predictors, had a test sample ROC-AUC of 0.85 (s.e. = 0.03). The 10-30% of respondents with the highest predicted risk included 44.9-92.5% of 12-month SAs.

It is unclear whether an equivalent density effect applies with other types of socioeconomic disadvantages. Methods We followed a population cohort of 2 million native Danes comprising all those born on 1st January 1965, or later, living in Denmark on their 15th birthday. Socioeconomic disadvantage, based on parents' circumstances at age 15 (low income, manual occupation, single parent and unemployed), was measured alongside neighbourhood prevalence of these indices. Results Each indicator was associated with a higher incidence of non-affective psychosis which remained the same, or was slightly reduced, if neighbourhood levels of disadvantage were lower. For example, for individuals from a low-income background there was no difference in incidence for those living in areas where a low-income was least common [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.01; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.10 v. those in the quintile where a low income was most common. Typically, differences associated with area-level disadvantage were the same whether or not cohort members had a disadvantaged background; for instance, for those from a manual occupation background, incidence was lower in the quintile where this was least v. most common (IRR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.97), as it was for those from a non-manual background (IRR 0.77; 95% CI 0.67-0.87).

In the UK, inequalities by ethnicity exist in accessing and receiving mental health treatment. However, limited research examines IAPT pathways to understand whether and at which points such inequalities may arise. Methods This study examined variation by ethnicity in (i) source of referral to IAPT services, (ii) receipt of assessment session, (iii) receipt of at least one treatment session. Routine data were collected on service user characteristics, referral source, assessment and treatment receipt from 85 800 individuals referred to South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust IAPT services between 1st January 2013 and 31st December 2016. Multinomial and logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations between ethnicity and referral source, assessment and treatment receipt. Missing ethnicity data (18.5%) were imputed using census data and reported alongside a complete case analysis. Results Compared to the White British group, Black African, Asian and Mixed ethnic groups were less likely to self-refer to IAPT services. Black Caribbean, Black Other and White Other groups are more likely to be referred through community services. Almost all racial and minority ethnic groups were less likely to receive an assessment compared to the White British group, and of those who were assessed, all racial and ethnic minority groups were less likely to be treated.

This study examined goal management, believed to be more closely related to executive impairment in daily life than other executive tasks, using a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm in patients in this illness phase. Methods Twenty-one currently manic patients with bipolar disorder and 30 matched healthy controls were scanned while performing the Computerized Multiple Elements Test (CMET). This requires participants to sequentially play four simple games, with transition between games being made either voluntarily (executive condition) or automatically (control condition). Results CMET performance was impaired in the manic patients compared to the healthy controls. Manic patients failed to increase activation in the lateral frontal, cingulate and inferior parietal cortex when the executive demands of the task increased, while this increase was observed in the healthy controls. Activity in these regions was associated with task performance. Conclusions Manic patients show evidence of impaired goal management, which is associated with a pattern of reduced medial and lateral frontal and parietal activity.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

This study assessed changes in mental health and help-seeking since COVID-19 restrictions in young Australians, including gender differences. Methods Data were drawn from a recent subsample (n = 443; 60% female; Mage = 22.0) of a prospective cohort originally recruited in secondary school to complete annual surveys. The subsample completed an additional COVID-19 survey during COVID-19 restrictions (May-June 2020), which was compared to responses from their latest annual survey (August 2019-March 2020). Mixed effect models with time and gender as the primary predictors were conducted for: (i) scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression 9-item (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) modules assessed before and during COVID-19 restrictions, and (ii) self-reported help-seeking from a health professional in February 2020, and the month preceding May-June 2020. Results Mean symptom scores increased from before to during COVID-19 restrictions on the PHQ-9 (coefficient: 1.29; 95% CI 0.72-1.86) and GAD-7 (0.78; 95% CI 0.26-1.31), but there was no increase in help-seeking over time (odds ratio 0.50; 95% CI 0.19-1.32). There was no evidence of differential changes by gender. Conclusions This study found increases in depression and anxiety symptoms but not greater help-seeking among young Australian adults during the first wave of the pandemic. Increasing availability and awareness of accessible treatment options and psychoeducation is critical, as well as further research into risk and protective factors to help target treatment to this vulnerable age group.

Methods Participants were 320 normotensive individuals who lived in slums and were attending a family doctor program. Measurements included a questionnaire covering sociodemographic characteristics, clinical status and life habits, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Incident hypertension was defined as the first occurrence at the follow-up review of the medical records of (1) systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or higher, (2) the participant started taking antihypertensive medication, or (3) a new diagnosis of hypertension made by a physician. Differences in sociodemographic, clinical, and lifestyle characteristics between hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals were compared using the χ2 and t tests. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Six variables - age, educational level, body mass, smoking, diabetes, and PTSD diagnosis - showed a statistically significant (p ≤ 0.20) association with the hypertensive status. In the Cox regression, only PTSD diagnosis was significantly associated with incident hypertension (multivariate HR = 1.94; 95% CI 1.11-3.40).

Frontline treatments (e.g. cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia) have limitations, prompting a search for alternative approaches. Here, we compare manualized Mindfulness-Based Therapy for Insomnia (MBTI) with a Sleep Hygiene, Education, and Exercise Program (SHEEP) in improving subjective and objective sleep outcomes in older adults. Methods We conducted a single-site, parallel-arm trial, with blinded assessments collected at baseline, post-intervention and 6-months follow-up. We randomized 127 participants aged 50-80, with a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score © 5, to either MBTI (n = 65) or SHEEP (n = 62), both 2 hr weekly group sessions lasting 8 weeks. Primary outcomes included PSQI and Insomnia Severity Index, and actigraphy- and polysomnography-measured sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset (WASO). Results Intention-to-treat analysis showed reductions in insomnia severity in both groups [MBTI: Cohen's effect size d = -1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.61 to -0.89; SHEEP: d = -0.69, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.43], with significantly greater improvement in MBTI. Sleep quality improved equivalently in both groups (MBTI: d = -1.19; SHEEP: d = -1.02). No significant interaction effects were observed in objective sleep measures. However, only MBTI had reduced WASOactigraphy (MBTI: d = -0.30; SHEEP: d = 0.02), SOLactigraphy (MBTI: d = -0.25; SHEEP: d = -0.09), and WASOPSG (MBTI: d = -0.26; SHEEP (d = -0.18). There was no change in SOLPSG. No participants withdrew because of adverse effects. Conclusions MBTI is effective at improving subjective and objective sleep quality in older adults, and could be a valid alternative for persons who have failed or do not have access to standard frontline therapies.

Using a longitudinal population-based cohort, we explored the relationship between objective and subjective neighbourhood characteristics and the odds of suicidal thoughts and attempts. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of 20764 participants living in Stockholm County who participated in the Stockholm Public Health Survey. We used multilevel modelling to examine if suicidal thoughts and attempts were associated with neighbourhood characteristics, independent of individual associations. We included objective and subjective measures to explore if there was a different relationship between these measures of the neighbourhood environment and suicidality. Results Associations between neighbourhood factors and suicidality were predominantly explained by individual characteristics, with the exception of neighbourhood-level deprivation and average residential trust. Each unit increase of deprivation was linked to increased odds of suicidal thoughts [Odds ratio (OR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.07] and attempts (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.17). Decreasing residential trust was associated with increased odds of suicide attempts (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17). There was no evidence that neighbourhood-level fragmentation or average trust in public and political institutions had an independent effect on suicidality once individual and sociodemographic factors were accounted for. Conclusions This study showed that much of the neighbourhood-level variation in suicidal thoughts and attempts could be explained by compositional factors, including sociodemographic clustering within neighbourhoods. The independent effect of neighbourhood-level deprivation and average residential trust provide evidence that the neighbourhood context may exert an independent effect on suicidality beyond the impact of individual characteristics.  © The Author(s), 2021.

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia patients with residual negative symptoms. Methods In this 6-week, randomized, single-blind, controlled study, a total of 100 schizophrenia patients with residual negative symptoms were randomly assigned to the MBI or control group. The 6-week MBI group and the control group with general rehabilitation programs maintained their original antipsychotic treatments. The scores for the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were recorded at baseline and week 6 to assess psychotic symptoms, cognitive performance, and emotional state, respectively. Results Compared with general rehabilitation programs, MBI alleviated the PANSS-negative subscore, general psychopathology subscore, and PANSS total score in schizophrenia patients with residual negative symptoms (F = 33.77, pBonferroni < 0.001; F = 42.01, pBonferroni < 0.001; F = 52.41, pBonferroni < 0.001, respectively).

This study aimed to assess whether childhood loneliness is associated with a long-term disruption in mental health that extends into adulthood. Methods This study is based on the longitudinal, community-representative Great Smoky Mountains Study of 1420 participants. Participants were assessed with the structured Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment interview up to eight times in childhood (ages 9-16; 6674 observations; 1993-2000) for childhood loneliness, associated psychiatric comorbidities and childhood adversities. Participants were followed up four times in adulthood (ages 19, 21, 25, and 30; 4556 observations of 1334 participants; 1999-2015) with the structured Young Adult Psychiatric Assessment Interview for psychiatric anxiety, depression, and substance use outcomes. Results Both self and parent-reported childhood loneliness were associated with adult self-reported anxiety and depressive outcomes. The associations remained significant when childhood adversities and psychiatric comorbidities were accounted for. There was no evidence for an association of childhood loneliness with adult substance use disorders. More associations were found between childhood loneliness and adult psychiatric symptoms than with adult diagnostic status. Conclusion Childhood loneliness is associated with anxiety and depressive disorders in young adults, suggesting that loneliness - even in childhood - might have long-term costs in terms of mental health. This study underscores the importance of intervening early to prevent loneliness and its sequelae over time.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

We evaluate the influence of schizophrenia family history on clinical outcomes of EDs. Methods We conducted a cohort evaluation of the association between family history of schizophrenia and ED clinical features, psychiatric comorbidities, and somatic and mental health burden in individuals born in Sweden 1977-2003 with anorexia nervosa (AN) or other EDs (OED: bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and ED not otherwise specified). Results Of 12 424 individuals with AN and 20 716 individuals with OED, 599 (4.8%) and 1118 (5.4%), respectively, had a family history of schizophrenia (in up to third-degree relatives). Among individuals with AN, schizophrenia in first-degree relatives was significantly associated with increased comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [HR(95% CI) 2.26 (1.27-3.99)], substance abuse disorder (SUD) [HR (95% CI) 1.93 (1.25-2.98)], and anxiety disorders [HR (95% CI) 1.47 (1.08-2.01)], but higher lowest illness-associated body mass index (BMI) [1.14 kg/m2, 95% CI (0.19-2.10)]. Schizophrenia in any relative (up to third-degree) in AN was significantly associated with higher somatic and mental health burden, but lower ED psychopathology scores [-0.29, 95% CI (-0.54 to -0.04)]. Schizophrenia in first-degree relatives in individuals with OED was significantly associated with increased comorbid ADHD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, SUD, anxiety disorders, somatic and mental health burden, and suicide attempts. Conclusions We observed different patterns of ED-related outcomes, psychiatric comorbidity, and illness burden in individuals with EDs with and without family histories of schizophrenia and provide new insights into the diverse manifestations of EDs.

Although mismatch negativity (MMN) has been widely studied across early phases of psychotic disorders, its potential as a common prognostic biomarker in early periods, such as clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis and first-episode psychosis (FEP), has not been fully studied. Methods A total of 104 FEP patients, 102 CHR individuals, and 107 healthy controls (HCs) participated in baseline MMN recording. Clinical outcomes were assessed; 17 FEP patients were treatment resistant, 73 FEP patients were nonresistant, 56 CHR individuals were nonremitters (15 transitioned to a psychotic disorder), and 22 CHR subjects were remitters. Baseline MMN amplitudes were compared across clinical outcome groups and tested for utility prognostic biomarkers using binary logistic regression. Results MMN amplitudes were greatest in HCs, intermediate in CHR subjects, and smallest in FEP patients. In the clinical outcome groups, MMN amplitudes were reduced from the baseline in both FEP and CHR patients with poor prognostic trajectories. Reduced baseline MMN amplitudes were a significant predictor of later treatment resistance in FEP patients [Exp(β) = 2.100, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.104-3.993, p = 0.024] and nonremission in CHR individuals [Exp(β) = 1.898, 95% CI 1.065-3.374, p = 0.030]. Conclusions These findings suggest that MMN could be used as a common prognostic biomarker across early psychosis periods, which will aid clinical decisions for early intervention.  © The Author(s), 2021.

This study examines the initiation and continuity of antipsychotic treatment among migrants and non-migrants with a non-affective psychosis during a new treatment episode. Methods This study is based on a nationwide sample of migrants and Finnish-born controls. Participants who were diagnosed with a psychotic disorder in 2011-2014 were identified from the Care Register for Health Care (n = 1693). Information on purchases of antipsychotic drugs in 2011-2015 was collected from the National Prescription Register. The duration of antipsychotic treatment since diagnosis was estimated using the PRE2DUP model. Cox regression analysis was used to study factors that are associated with discontinuing the use of medication. Results There were fewer initiators of antipsychotic treatment after being diagnosed with psychosis among migrants (68.1%) than among Finnish-born patients (73.6%). After controlling for sociodemographic background and factors related to the type of disorder and treatment, migrants were more likely to discontinue medication (adjusted hazard ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.08-1.52). The risk of discontinuation was highest among migrants from North Africa and the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa and among recent migrants. Non-use of antipsychotic treatment before being diagnosed with psychosis, involuntary hospitalization and diagnosis other than schizophrenia were associated with earlier discontinuation both among migrants and non-migrants. Conclusions Migrants with a psychotic disorder are less likely to continue antipsychotic treatment than non-migrants. The needs of migrant patients have to be addressed to improve adherence.

However, the mechanisms underlying the suicide and disordered eating link are largely unknown, and current assessments are still unable to accurately predict future suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The purpose of this study is to test the utility of two promising proximal risk factors, sleep quality and agitation, in predicting suicidal ideation in a sample of individuals with elevated suicidal thoughts and behaviors, namely those with eating disorders. Methods Women (N = 97) receiving treatment at an eating disorder treatment center completed weekly questionnaires assessing suicidal ideation, agitation, and sleep. General linear mixed models examined whether agitation and/or sleep quality were concurrently or prospectively associated with suicidal ideation across 12 weeks of treatment. Results There was a significant interaction between within-person agitation and sleep quality on suicidal ideation [B(s.e.) = -0.02(0.01), p < 0.05], such that on weeks when an individual experienced both higher than their average agitation and lower than their average sleep quality, they also experienced their highest levels of suicidal ideation. However, neither agitation nor sleep quality prospectively predicted suicidal ideation. Conclusions This study was the first to examine dynamic associations between interpersonal constructs and suicidal ideation in individuals with eating disorders. Results suggest that ongoing assessment for overarousal symptoms, such as agitation and poor sleep quality, in individuals with eating disorders may be warranted in order to manage suicidal ideation among this vulnerable population.  © The Author(s), 2021.

In schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, descriptions of speech are used to assess the severity of psychotic symptoms. In the current study, we assessed the diagnostic value of acoustic speech parameters in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, as well as its value in recognizing positive and negative symptoms. Methods Speech was obtained from 142 patients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and 142 matched controls during a semi-structured interview on neutral topics. Patients were categorized as having predominantly positive or negative symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Acoustic parameters were extracted with OpenSMILE, employing the extended Geneva Acoustic Minimalistic Parameter Set, which includes standardized analyses of pitch (F0), speech quality and pauses. Speech parameters were fed into a random forest algorithm with leave-ten-out cross-validation to assess their value for a schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis, and PANSS subtype recognition. Results The machine-learning speech classifier attained an accuracy of 86.2% in classifying patients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and controls on speech parameters alone. Patients with predominantly positive v. negative symptoms could be classified with an accuracy of 74.2%. Conclusions Our results show that automatically extracted speech parameters can be used to accurately classify patients with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and healthy controls, as well as differentiate between patients with predominantly positive v. negatives symptoms. Thus, the field of speech technology has provided a standardized, powerful tool that has high potential for clinical applications in diagnosis and differentiation, given its ease of comparison and replication across samples.

In particular, cross-sectional studies suggest that affective symptoms may influence the emergence of psychotic symptoms. However, longitudinal analysis offers a more compelling test for causation: the European Schizophrenia Cohort (EuroSC) provides data suitable for this purpose. We predicted that the persistence of psychotic symptoms would be driven by the continuing presence of affective disturbance. Methods EuroSC included 1208 patients randomly sampled from outpatient services in France, Germany and the UK. Initial measures of psychotic and affective symptoms were repeated four times at 6-month intervals, thereby furnishing five time-points. To examine interactions between symptoms both within and between time-slices, we adopted a novel technique for modelling longitudinal data in psychiatry. This was a form of Bayesian network analysis that involved learning dynamic directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Results Our DAG analysis suggests that the main drivers of symptoms in this long-term sample were delusions and paranoid thinking. These led to affective disturbance, not vice versa as we initially predicted. The enduring relationship between symptoms was unaffected by whether patients were receiving first- or second-generation antipsychotic medication. Conclusions In this cohort of people with chronic schizophrenia treated with medication, symptoms were essentially stable over long periods. However, affective symptoms appeared driven by the persistence of delusions and persecutory thinking, a finding not previously reported. Although our findings as ever remain hostage to unmeasured confounders, these enduring psychotic symptoms might nevertheless be appropriate candidates for directly targeted psychological interventions.  © The Author(s), 2021.

We examined the latent structure of stress and adversity related to the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women, potential antecedents of COVID-19-related stress and adversity in this population, and associations with prenatal depressive symptoms. Method We surveyed 725 pregnant women residing in the San Francisco Bay Area in March-May 2020, 343 of whom provided addresses that were geocoded and matched by census tract to measures of community-level risk. We compared their self-reported depressive symptoms to women matched on demographic factors and history of mental health difficulties who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. Results Women who were pregnant during the pandemic were nearly twice as likely to have possible depression than were matched women who were pregnant prior to the pandemic. Individual- and community-level factors tied to socioeconomic inequality were associated with latent factors of COVID-19-related stress and adversity. Beyond objective adversity, subjective stress responses were strongly associated with depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Conclusions Highlighting the role of subjective responses in vulnerability to prenatal depression and factors that influence susceptibility to COVID-19-related stress, these findings inform the allocation of resources to support recovery from this pandemic and future disease outbreaks. In addition to policies that mitigate disruptions to the environment due to the pandemic, treatments that focus on cognitions about the self and the environment may help to alleviate depressive symptoms in pregnant women.

Current structured approaches to assess inpatient violence risk lack predictive validity and linkage to interventions. Methods Adult psychiatric inpatients on forensic and general wards in three psychiatric hospitals were recruited and followed up prospectively for 6 months. Information on modifiable (dynamic) risk factors were collected every 1-4 weeks, and baseline background factors. Data were transferred to a web-based monitoring system (FOxWeb) to calculate a total dynamic risk score. Outcomes were extracted from an incident-reporting system recording aggression and interpersonal violence. The association between total dynamic score and violent incidents was assessed by multilevel logistic regression and compared with dynamic score excluded. Results We recruited 89 patients and conducted 624 separate assessments (median 5/patient). Mean age was 39 (s.d. 12.5) years with 20% (n = 18) female. Common diagnoses were schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (70%, n = 62) and personality disorders (20%, n = 18). There were 93 violent incidents. Factors contributing to violence risk were a total dynamic score of ≥1 (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.25-9.20), 10-year increase in age (OR 0.67, 0.47-0.96), and female sex (OR 2.78, 1.04-7.40). Non-significant associations with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder were found (OR 0.50, 0.20-1.21). In a fixed-effect model using all covariates, AUC was 0.77 (0.72-0.82) and 0.75 (0.70-0.80) when the dynamic score was excluded. Conclusions In predicting violence risk in individuals with psychiatric disorders, modifiable factors added little incremental value beyond static ones in a psychiatric inpatient setting. Future work should make a clear distinction between risk factors that assist in prediction and those linked to needs.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.","Article","Scopus"

In the current study, we examined whether a history of prenatal loss is associated with a subsequent pregnancy with maternal psychological state using ecological momentary assessment (EMA)-based measures of pregnancy-specific distress and mood in everyday life. Method This study was conducted in a cohort of N = 155 healthy pregnant women, of which N = 40 had a history of prenatal loss. An EMA protocol was used in early and late pregnancy to collect repeated measures of maternal stress and mood, on average eight times per day over a consecutive 4-day period. The association between a history of prenatal loss and psychological state was estimated using linear mixed models. Results Compared to women who had not experienced a prior prenatal loss, women with a history of prenatal loss reported higher levels of pregnancy-specific distress in early as well as late pregnancy and also were more nervous and tired. Furthermore, in the comparison group pregnancy-specific distress decreased and mood improved from early to late pregnancy, whereas these changes across pregnancy were not evident in women in the prenatal loss group. Conclusion Our findings suggest that prenatal loss in a prior pregnancy is associated with a subsequent pregnancy with significantly higher stress and impaired mood levels in everyday life across gestation. These findings have important implications for designing EMA-based ambulatory, personalized interventions to reduce stress during pregnancy in this high-risk group.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

It has previously been found to be associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, low medical trust, minority ethnic group membership, low perceived risk from COVID-19, use of certain social media platforms and conspiracy beliefs. However, it is unclear which of these predictors might explain variance associated with others. Methods An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 4343 UK residents, aged 18-75, between 21 November and 21 December 2020. Predictors of vaccine hesitancy were assessed using linear rank-order models. Results Coronavirus vaccine hesitancy is associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, high informational reliance on social media, low informational reliance on print and broadcast media, membership of other than white ethnic groups, low perceived risk from COVID-19 and low trust in scientists and medics, as well as (to a much lesser extent) low trust in government. Coronavirus conspiracy suspicions and general vaccine attitudes appear uniquely predictive, jointly explaining 35% of variance. Following controls for these variables, effects associated with trust, ethnicity and social media reliance largely or completely disappear, whereas the effect associated with education is reversed. Conclusions Strengthening positive attitudes to vaccination and reducing conspiracy suspicions with regards to the coronavirus may have a positive effect on vaccine uptake, especially among ethnic groups with heightened vaccine hesitancy. However, vaccine hesitancy associated with age and gender does not appear to be explained by other predictor variables tested here.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Combining data on metabolomics and depressive symptoms, we aimed to identify depressions associated with an increased risk of adverse metabolic alterations. Method Clustering data were from 1094 individuals with major depressive disorder in the last 6 months and measures of 149 metabolites from a 1H-NMR platform and 30 depressive symptoms (IDS-SR30). Canonical correlation analyses (CCA) were used to identify main independent metabolite-symptom axes of variance. Then, for the replication, we examined the association of the identified dimensions with metabolites from the same platform and cardiometabolic diseases in an independent population-based cohort (n = 6572). Results CCA identified an overall depression dimension and a dimension resembling IMD, in which symptoms such as sleeping too much, increased appetite, and low energy level had higher relative loading. In the independent sample, the overall depression dimension was associated with lower cardiometabolic risk, such as (i.e. per s.d.) HOMA-1B -0.06 (95% CI -0.09 - -0.04), and visceral adipose tissue -0.10 cm2 (95% CI -0.14 - -0.07). In contrast, the IMD dimension was associated with well-known cardiometabolic diseases such as higher visceral adipose tissue 0.08 cm2 (95% CI 0.04-0.12), HOMA-1B 0.06 (95% CI 0.04-0.09), and lower HDL-cholesterol levels -0.03 mmol/L (95% CI -0.05 - -0.01). Conclusions Combining metabolomics and clinical symptoms we identified a replicable depression dimension associated with adverse metabolic alterations, in line with the IMD hypothesis. Patients with IMD may be at higher cardiometabolic risk and may benefit from specific treatment targeting underlying metabolic dysregulations.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Accordingly, we lack sufficient understanding of the extent to which problems associated with CM and ETV vary based on the amount (i.e. dose) of exposure to both of these experiences. Methods We used 20 samples (28,300 individuals) to estimate person-centered profiles of CM and ETV occurrence and co-occurrence within each sample. An individual data multilevel meta-analytic framework was used to determine the average effect size across samples for different profiles and conditional probability correlations within sociodemographic, neighborhood, health, mental health, and psychosocial domains. Results The profile characterized by high levels of CM and high levels of ETV correlated with stressful life events, depression and anxiety symptoms, and general indicators of externalizing behaviors. CM predominant profiles were associated with mental health diagnoses and treatment. ETV predominant profiles associated with risk-taking/violent behavior and neighborhood-level disadvantage. However, nuance based on the dose of CM or ETV was evident. Conclusions It is important to identify subgroups based on the amount of exposure to CM and ETV. These subgroups have differential relationships with correlates across domains. Greater delineation and description of the lived experience will allow for more precision in addressing the burden of childhood adversity.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

The objective of this study was to estimate the lifetime prevalence of NSSI in adults and its association with sociodemographic characteristics, psychiatric disorders, and lifetime treatment for NSSI. Methods A nationally representative face-to-face survey was conducted with 7192 adults aged ≥18 years in England. Respondents were interviewed about engagement in NSSI, psychiatric illness, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and treatment history for this behavior. Results The estimated lifetime prevalence rate of NSSI was 4.86%. Younger age, growing up without biological parents in the household, being unmarried, and impoverished backgrounds were associated with NSSI. The majority of respondents with lifetime NSSI (63.82%) had at least one current psychiatric disorder. Most psychiatric conditions were associated with greater odds of lifetime NSSI in multivariate models. NSSI was strongly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, respectively, even after accounting for psychiatric disorders and sociodemographic covariates. A substantial proportion of respondents with NSSI history (30.92%) have engaged in medically severe self-harm, as indexed by requiring medical attention for this behavior. The majority of respondents with NSSI (56.20%) had not received psychiatric care for this behavior. Conclusions NSSI is prevalent in the general population and associated with considerable psychiatric comorbidity. A high rate of unmet treatment needs is evident among those with this behavior. Those at the greatest lifetime risk for NSSI may also be particularly limited in their resources to cope with this behavior.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

Yet, remission is not achieved for about half of adolescents with AN receiving FBT. Understanding patient- and parent-level factors that predict FBT response may inform treatment development and improve outcomes. Methods Network analysis was used to identify the most central symptoms of AN in adolescents who completed the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) prior to FBT (N = 409). Bridge pathways between adolescent AN and parental self-efficacy in facilitating their child's recovery from AN were identified in a subset of participants (n = 184). Central and bridge symptoms were tested as predictors of early response (≥2.4 kg weight gain by the fourth session of FBT) and end-of-treatment weight restoration [≥95% expected body weight (EBW)] and full remission (≥95% EBW and EDE score within 1 standard deviation of norms). Results The most central symptoms of adolescent AN included desiring weight loss, dietary restraint, and feeling fat. These symptoms predicted early response, but not end-of-treatment outcomes. Bridge symptoms were parental beliefs about their responsibility to renourish their child, adolescent discomfort eating in front of others, and adolescent dietary restraint. Bridge symptoms predicted end-of-treatment weight restoration, but not early response nor full remission. Conclusions Findings highlight the prognostic utility of core symptoms of adolescent AN. Parent beliefs about their responsibility to renourish their child may maintain associations between parental self-efficacy and AN psychopathology. These findings could inform strategies to adapt FBT and improve outcomes.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Method We used two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the impact of personality on the risk and survival of BC. In total, 109 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were utilized as instruments of neuroticism from a large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), and five SNPs were utilized as instruments of extraversion from Genetic of Personality Consortium and 23andMe. Genetic association with the risk and survival of overall and individual subtype BC were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Result Neuroticism is significantly associated with the risk of overall BC [odds ratio (OR) 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.11; p = 0.015] and the risk of luminal A BC (OR 1.09; 95% CI 1.03-1.16; p = 0.004). Extraversion is not associated with the risk of BC. None of neuroticism or extraversion is associated with the survival of BC.

Methods Participants were 1631 children (51.5% girls) from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. A wide range of perinatal and early-life factors were assessed from pregnancy to age 2.5 years using medical files and mothers' reports. Psychopathic traits were assessed via teachers' reports at ages 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12 years. Latent class growth analyses and multinomial logistic regressions controlling for child sex were conducted. Two-way interaction effects between perinatal/early-life factors and child sex were explored. Results Four trajectories of psychopathic traits were identified: High-stable (4.48%), Increasing (8.77%), Decreasing (11.46%), and Low-stable (75.29%). A few perinatal factors and most child-level and family-level early-life factors significantly increased the odds of following the High-stable v. the Low-stable trajectory. Higher levels of psychotropic exposures during pregnancy, socioeconomic adversity, child's physical aggression, child's opposition, mother's depressive symptoms, and hostile parenting increased the likelihood of following the Increasing instead of the Low-stable trajectory. Higher socioeconomic adversity, mother's depressive symptoms, and inconsistent parenting were associated with membership to the High-stable instead of the Decreasing trajectory. Most associations were not moderated by child sex. Conclusions These results shed light on the perinatal and early-life factors that are associated with specific pathways of psychopathic traits during childhood and suggest that different factors could be targeted to prevent the exacerbation (v. low and stable levels) or the stability at high levels (v. attenuation) of these traits.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Although there is limited evidence for clinical and cognitive effects, most studies were small, single-session and stimulated left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). No sham-controlled study has stimulated the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC), which is the most consistently under-functioning region in ADHD, with multiple anodal-tDCS sessions combined with cognitive training (CT) to enhance effects. Thus, we investigated the clinical and cognitive effects of multi-session anodal-tDCS over rIFC combined with CT in double-blind, randomised, sham-controlled trial (RCT, ISRCTN48265228). Methods Fifty boys with ADHD (10-18 years) received 15 weekday sessions of anodal- or sham-tDCS over rIFC combined with CT (20 min, 1 mA). ANCOVA, adjusting for baseline measures, age and medication status, tested group differences in clinical and ADHD-relevant executive functions at posttreatment and after 6 months. Results ADHD-Rating Scale, Conners ADHD Index and adverse effects were significantly lower at post-treatment after sham relative to anodal tDCS. No other effects were significant. Conclusions This rigorous and largest RCT of tDCS in adolescent boys with ADHD found no evidence of improved ADHD symptoms or cognitive performance following multi-session anodal tDCS over rIFC combined with CT. These findings extend limited meta-analytic evidence of cognitive and clinical effects in ADHD after 1-5 tDCS sessions over mainly left dlPFC. Given that tDCS is commercially and clinically available, the findings are important as they suggest that rIFC stimulation may not be indicated as a neurotherapy for cognitive or clinical remediation for ADHD.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Methods Individual patient data from all six eligible randomised controlled trials were used to develop (k = 3, n = 1722) and test (k = 3, n = 918) nine models. Predictors included depressive and anxiety symptoms, social support, life events and alcohol use. Weighted sum scores were developed using coefficient weights derived from network centrality statistics (models 1-3) and factor loadings from a confirmatory factor analysis (model 4). Unweighted sum score models were tested using elastic net regularised (ENR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression (models 5 and 6). Individual items were then included in ENR and OLS (models 7 and 8). All models were compared to one another and to a null model (mean post-baseline Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II) score in the training data: model 9). Primary outcome: BDI-II scores at 3-4 months. Results Models 1-7 all outperformed the null model and model 8. Model performance was very similar across models 1-6, meaning that differential weights applied to the baseline sum scores had little impact. Conclusions Any of the modelling techniques (models 1-7) could be used to inform prognostic predictions for depressed adults with differences in the proportions of patients reaching remission based on the predicted severity of depressive symptoms post-treatment. However, the majority of variance in prognosis remained unexplained. It may be necessary to include a broader range of biopsychosocial variables to better adjudicate between competing models, and to derive models with greater clinical utility for treatment-seeking adults with depression.  © The Author(s), 2021.

This study evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of a scalable cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) sleep intervention tailored for these periods. Methods This is a two-arm, parallel-group, single-blind, superiority randomised controlled trial. Nulliparous females without severe medical/psychiatric conditions were randomised 1:1 to CBT or attention- and time-matched control. All participants received a 1 h telephone session and automated multimedia emails from the third trimester until 6 months postpartum. Outcomes were assessed with validated instruments at gestation weeks 30 (baseline) and 35 (pregnancy endpoint), and postpartum months 1.5, 3, 6 (postpartum endpoint), 12 and 24. Results In total, 163 eligible participants (age M ± s.d. = 33.35 ± 3.42) were randomised. The CBT intervention was well accepted, with no reported adverse effect. Intention-to-treat analyses showed that compared to control, receiving CBT was associated with lower insomnia severity and sleep disturbance (two primary outcomes), and lower sleep-related impairment at the pregnancy endpoint (p values  © 0.001), as well as at 24 months postpartum (p ranges 0.012-0.052). Group differences across the first postpartum year were non-significant. Participants with elevated insomnia symptoms at baseline benefitted substantially more from CBT (v. control), including having significantly lower insomnia symptoms throughout the first postpartum year. Group differences in symptoms of depression or anxiety were non-significant. Conclusions A scalable CBT sleep intervention is efficacious in buffering against sleep disturbance during pregnancy and benefitted sleep at 2-year postpartum, especially for individuals with insomnia symptoms during pregnancy. The intervention holds promise for implementation into routine perinatal care. ","Article","Scopus"

We seek to understand if these pandemic-related behaviors impact subsequent mental health. Methods Daily online survey data were collected on adults during May/June 2020. Measures were of daily physical and virtual (online) contact with others; substance and media use; and indices of psychological striving, struggling and COVID-related worry. Using random-intercept cross-lagged panel analysis, dynamic within-person cross-lagged effects were separated from more static individual differences. Results In total, 1148 participants completed daily surveys [657 (57.2%) females, 484 (42.1%) males; mean age 40.6 (s.d. 12.4) years]. Daily increases in news consumed increased COVID-related worrying the next day [cross-lagged estimate = 0.034 (95% CI 0.018-0.049), FDR-adjusted p = 0.00005] and vice versa [0.03 (0.012-0.048), FDR-adjusted p = 0.0017]. Increased media consumption also exacerbated subsequent psychological struggling [0.064 (0.03-0.098), FDR-adjusted p = 0.0005]. There were no significant cross-lagged effects of daily changes in social distancing or virtual contact on later mental health. Conclusions We delineate a cycle wherein a daily increase in media consumption results in a subsequent increase in COVID-related worries, which in turn increases daily media consumption. Moreover, the adverse impact of news extended to broader measures of psychological struggling. A similar dynamic did not unfold between the daily amount of physical or virtual contact and subsequent mental health. Findings are consistent with current recommendations to moderate news and media consumption in order to promote mental health.  © The Author(s), 2021.

Clinicians in pediatric emergency departments (EDs) often are required to assess suicidal risk. The Death Implicit Association Test (IAT) is an alternative to self-report assessment of suicidal risk that may have utility in ED settings. Methods A total of 1679 adolescents recruited from 13 pediatric emergency rooms in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network were assessed using a self-report survey of risk and protective factors for a suicide attempt, and the IAT, and then followed up 3 months later to determine if an attempt had occurred. The accuracy of prediction was compared between self-reports and the IAT using the area under the curve (AUC) with respect to receiver operator characteristics. Results A few self-report variables, namely, current and past suicide ideation, past suicidal behavior, total negative life events, and school or social connectedness, predicted an attempt at 3 months with an AUC of 0.87 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.84-0.90] in the entire sample, and AUC = 0.91, (95% CI 0.85-0.95) for those who presented without reported suicidal ideation. The IAT did not add significantly to the predictive power of selected self-report variables. The IAT alone was modestly predictive of 3-month attempts in the overall sample ((AUC = 0.59, 95% CI 0.52-0.65) and was a better predictor in patients who were non-suicidal at baseline (AUC = 0.67, 95% CI 0.55-0.79). Conclusions In pediatric EDs, a small set of self-reported items predicted suicide attempts within 3 months more accurately than did the IAT.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

We aimed to quantify the suicide rates among people with serious mental illness (bipolar disorder, major depression, or schizophrenia). Methods PubMed and Web of Science were searched to identify studies published from 1 January 1975 to 10 December 2020. We assessed English-language studies for the suicide rates among people with serious mental illness. Random-effects meta-analysis was used. Changes in follow-up time and the suicide rates were presented by a locally weighted scatter-plot smoothing (LOESS) curve. Suicide rate ratio was estimated for assessments of difference in suicide rate by sex. Results Of 5014 identified studies, 41 were included in this analysis. The pooled suicide rate was 312.8 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 230.3-406.8). Europe was reported to have the highest pooled suicide rate of 335.2 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 261.5-417.6). Major depression had the highest suicide rate of 534.3 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 30.4-1448.7). There is a downward trend in suicide rate estimates over follow-up time. Excess risk of suicide in males was found [1.90 (95% CI 1.60-2.25)]. The most common suicide method was poisoning [21.9 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 3.7-50.4)]. Conclusions The suicide rates among people with serious mental illness were high, highlighting the requirements for increasing psychological assessment and monitoring. Further study should focus on region and age differences in suicide among this population.  © The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press.","Article","Scopus"

Methods Data were drawn from the iPSYCH2012 case-cohort sample, a population-based sample of individuals born in Denmark between 1981 and 2005. The sample included 18 532 individuals who were diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist by age 31 years, and a comparison group of 20 184 individuals. Information on SLEs was obtained from nationwide registers and operationalized as a time-varying count variable. Hazard ratios and cumulative incidence rates were estimated using Cox regressions. Results Risk for depression increased by 35% with each standard deviation increase in polygenic liability (p < 0.0001), and 36% (p < 0.0001) with each additional SLE. There was a small interaction between polygenic liability and SLEs (β = -0.04, p = 0.0009). The probability of being diagnosed with depression in a hospital-based setting between ages 15 and 31 years ranged from 1.5% among males in the lowest quartile of polygenic liability with 0 events by age 15, to 18.8% among females in the highest quartile of polygenic liability with 4+ events by age 15. Conclusions These findings suggest that although there is minimal interaction between polygenic liability and SLEs as risk factors for hospital-treated depression, combining information on these two important risk factors could potentially be useful for identifying high-risk individuals.

We examine the extent to which 'alternatives' - including 'Postpsychiatry', 'Open Dialogue', the 'Power, Threat and Meaning Framework' and Service User Involvement in Research - really do depart from mainstream models in terms of theory, practice and empirical research and identify some shortcomings in each. We propose an approach which seeks more firmly to ground mental distress within the lifeworld of those who experience it, with a particular focus on the biopsychosocial niches within which we make our lives, and the impact of systematic disadvantage, structural violence and other toxic exposures within the spaces and places that constitute and constrain many everyday lives. Further, we argue that a truly alternative psychiatry requires psychiatric professionals to go beyond simply listening to the voices of service users: to overcome epistemic injustice requires professionals to recognise that those who have experience of mental health services have their own expertise in accounting for their distress and in evaluating alternative forms of treatment. Finally we suggest that, if 'another psychiatry' is possible, this requires a radical reimagination of the role and responsibilities of the medically trained psychiatrist within and outside the clinical encounter.

Investigating educational achievement in the first episode of psychosis (FEP) patients may shed light on the origins of the alterations and on the variability of outcomes in psychotic disorders. Methods Education achievement was explored in a large sample (n = 659) of FEP patients enrolled in programa de atención a fases iniciales de psicosis (PAFIP), a research and assistance program conducted in Spain. Patients were stratified according to the Spanish educational system according to their attendance in primary (low), secondary (medium) or university studies (high). The three groups were compared on available premorbid, clinical and neuropsychological variables. A subgroup of patients (n = 209), comprising the 10-year follow-up PAFIP cohort, were again compared. Results Overall, 49% and 37% of FEP patients had low and medium levels of education, respectively. In total, 13% of the patients with a higher level of education were more frequently women (64%) and older at illness onset (36 years old), reported better premorbid adjustment, presented less severe positive symptoms and better functioning; and showed higher premorbid intelligence quotient and better performance on all the explored cognitive domains. Ten years later the FEP patients in the medium- and high-education groups had good global functioning and a neurocognitive performance within the normal limits. Conclusions Higher education is associated with better initial conditions and more favourable outcomes after an FEP. Sharing this information with the world's educational systems is essential to targeting resources and designing innovative programs or strategies to compensate for student difficulties.
