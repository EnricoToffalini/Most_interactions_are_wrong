People can report uncertainty in the form of confidence judgments, but how such judgments contribute to learning and subsequent decisions remains unclear. In a series of three experiments employing an operant learning task, we tested the hypothesis that confidence plays a central role in learning by regulating resource allocation to the seeking and processing of feedback. We predicted that, as participants’ confidence in their task knowledge grew, they would discount feedback when it was provided and be correspondingly less willing to pay for it when it was costly. Consistent with these predictions, we found that higher confidence was associated with reduced electrophysiological markers of feedback processing and decreased updating of beliefs following feedback receipt. Bayesian modeling suggests that this decrease in processing was due to a drop in the expected informative value of novel information when participants were highly confident. Thus, when choosing whether to pay a fee to receive further feedback, participants’ subjective confidence, rather than the objective accuracy of their decisions, guided their choices. Overall, our results suggest that confidence regulates learning and subsequent decision making. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

This study aims to examine whether language moderates the association between space and number in the spatial–numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect, which is demonstrated in an interaction between number magnitude and response side. The SNARC effect has been observed across various stimuli. However, research on the influence of linguistic factors, such as reading direction, on the SNARC effect has yielded contradictory findings.We systematically examined the moderating effect of language on the SNARC effect in a cross-cultural design.A group of British English speakers and a group of Iranian Farsi speakers performed four SNARC tasks including both explicit (magnitude classification) and implicit (parity judgment) processing of number magnitude in two modalities of visual and auditory presentations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of language, magnitude processing, and sensory modalities altogether. While our registered analyses found no group differences in SNARC tasks, nonregistered analyses using a Bayesian ex-Gaussian framework revealed novel findings: a stronger SNARC effect in slower responses and auditory tasks. These findings challenge the idea of a substantial language role in shaping the SNARC effect but also indicate large uncertainty regarding the exact nature of language-induced effects, highlighting the need for further investigations of spatial– numerical interactions that may be differently influenced by linguistic and cultural factors. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Apparently, people can psychologically represent people, including themselves, as multiple individuals at the same time. Here, we ask whether the intransitive judgments found in these studies truly reflect the operation of an intransitive concept of personal identity.Wemanipulate several factors that arbitrate between transitivity and intransitivity and find most support for transitivity: In contrast to the prior work, most participants do not make intransitive judgments when there is any reason to favor one individual over another. People change which single individual they personally identify with, depending on which individual competes more strongly or weakly for identity, rather than identifying with both individuals. Even when two individuals are identical and therefore both entitled to be the same person, we find that people make more transitive judgments once they understand the practical commitments of their responses (Experiment 4) and report not being able to actually imagine two perspectives simultaneously when reasoning about the scenario (Experiment 5). In short, we suggest that while people may make intransitive judgments, these do not reflect that they psychologically represent identity in an intransitive manner. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Yet aggression, for example, between groups, abounds. How do people learn to overcome this aversion in order to aggress? Many models of learning emphasize outcome prediction errors—deviations from expected outcomes in the environment—but aggression may also be fueled by affective prediction errors (affective PEs)—deviations from how we expect to feel. Across five preregistered online experiments that hold outcome prediction errors constant (N = 4,607), participants choosing aggressive or nonaggressive actions aggressed more against disliked group members and often escalated or persisted in taking actions that felt better than expected (positive affective PE), especially when those actions were aggressive. Crucially, inducing incidental empathy toward the group of the target rendered affective PE signals sensitive to group identification—participants escalated aggression that felt better than expected relatively less toward liked versus disliked group members. That said, affective PEs did not always add explanatory power beyond levels of postoutcome affect alone; we discuss the importance and implications of these results. In summary, we reveal affective PE integration as a candidate algorithm facilitating exceptions to harm aversion in intergroup conflict. More broadly, we highlight for affective science and decision-making researchers the necessity of appropriately testing separable components of affective signals in predicting subsequent behavior. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In these contexts, speakers dynamically modify their communication across vocal (e.g., speaking rate) and gestural (e.g., cospeech gestures related in meaning to the content of speech) channels while speaking. What is the function of these adjustments? Here we ask whether speakers dynamically make these adjustments to increase communicative success, and decrease cognitive effort while speaking. We assess whether speakers modulate word durations and produce iconic (i.e., imagistically evoking properties of referents) gestures depending on the predictability of each word they utter. Predictability is operationalized as surprisal and computed from computational language models trained on corpora of child-directed, or adult-directed language. Using data from a novel corpus (Ecological Language Corpus) of naturalistic interactions between adult–child (aged 3–4), and adult– adult, we show that surprisal predicts speakers’ multimodal adjustments and that some of these effects are modulated by whether the comprehender is a child or an adult. Thus, communicative efficiency applies generally across vocal and gestural communicative channels not being limited to structural properties of language or vocal modality. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

Participants performed mouse tracker versions of Stroop (Studies 1 and 2) and flankers (Study 2), along with additional measures of attention control and working memory to better examine individual differences in how conflict resolution processes unfold over time. Attention control abilities were related to the amount of attraction to the incorrect response and the time to move toward the correct response on incongruent trials in the Stroop task. In the flanker task, attention control abilities were not related to the amount of attraction to the incorrect response but were related to the time to move toward the correct response on incongruent trials. Mouse tracker measures in both Stroop and flankers demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties and tended to load moderately on an attention control factor along with other attention control tasks. These results are consistent with the notion that conflict resolution processes in Stroop and flankers likely reflect both overlapping and distinct (i.e., restraining and constraining attention) processes that are related to broader attention control abilities. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The AB has been widely accepted as a suppression of T2 processing at the postperceptual stage. The current event-related potential study updates this view by demonstrating the existence of an early perceptual locus of suppression during the AB. Using line drawings of real-life objects as RSVP items, we required participants in Experiment 1 to either discriminate the exact identities or simply classify the object categories of T1 and T2, and in Experiment 2, we instructed participants to discriminate either T1 and T2 identities (dual-target task) or only T2 identity (single-target task) to invalidate the temporal expectation as an alternative account. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the T2-elicited first positive peak (P1) component was consistently decreased at Lag 3 whenever a dual-target, but not single-target, task was required, and the magnitude of this P1 suppression was significantly predictive of the behavioral AB magnitude in each dualtarget task. When the RSVP items were substituted by classic but size-matched alphanumeric characters in Experiment 3, no P1 suppression was evident as expected, ruling out the large stimulus size as an alternative interpretation. These findings provide the strongest evidence to date that the AB can begin to suppress T2 processing at a very early perceptual stage, at least when observers encounter RSVP items of real-life objects, which calls for more flexible cognitive models for the AB. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, the impact of misinformation may also be successfully addressed by introducing or bolstering alternative beliefs with opposite evaluative implications. Six preregistered experiments clarified important processes influencing the impact of bypassing versus correcting misinformation via negation. First, we find that, following exposure to misinformation, bypassing generally changes people’s attitudes and intentions more than correction in the form of a simple negation. Second, this relative advantage is not a function of the depth at which information is processed but rather the degree to which people form attitudes or beliefs when they receive the misinformation. When people form attitudes when they first receive the misinformation, bypassing has no advantage over corrections, likely owing to anchoring. In contrast, when individuals focus on the accuracy of the statements and form beliefs, bypassing is significantly more successful at changing their attitudes because these attitudes are constructed based on expectancy-value principles, while misinformation continues to influence attitudes after correction.

A different body of research finds that opposing political views and the people who hold them are seen as repugnant. How could it be that people receptive to opposing political ideas are viewed positively when the political opponents they are receptive to are seen negatively? In seven main (N = 5,286) and nine supplemental studies (N = 3,983 participants in online studies; N = 124,493 observations in field data), we reconcile this tension by arguing that the identity of the person one is receptive to determines whether receptiveness carries reputational benefits or costs. When the information source belongs to the opposing party, receptiveness to opposing political views often carries reputational costs. We find these reputational costs across both strong and weak signals of receptiveness, eight different political and social issues, and multiple types of prototypical out-party sources. We argue that these costs arise because members of the opposing party are frequently stereotyped as immoral, and thus receptiveness to their ideas is seen negatively. As a boundary condition, we find that the costs of receptiveness are pronounced for sources who are prototypical of the out-party and attenuate (or even reverse) for sources who are nonprototypical. These findings resolve a seeming contradiction between two distinct literatures in psychology, contribute to a rapidly expanding literature on the interpersonal consequences of receptiveness, and lay the groundwork for understanding novel barriers to, and ultimately solutions for, the lack of cross-party openness and political polarization. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Despite a growing literature, there are disputes as to whether the processes of trust in AI are similar to that of interpersonal trust (i.e., in fellow humans). The aim of the present article is twofold. First, we provide a systematic test of an integrative model of trust inspired by interpersonal trust research encompassing trust, its antecedents (trustworthiness and trust propensity), and its consequences (intentions to use the AI and willingness to disclose personal information). Second, we investigate the role of AI personalization on trust and trustworthiness, considering both their mean levels and their dynamic relationships. In two pilot studies (N = 313) and one main study (N = 1,001) focusing on AI chatbots, we find that the integrative model of trust is suitable for the study of trust in virtual AI. Perceived trustworthiness of the AI, and more specifically its ability and integrity dimensions, is a significant antecedent of trust and so are anthropomorphism and propensity to trust smart technology. Trust, in turn, leads to greater intentions to use and willingness to disclose information to the AI. The personalized AI chatbot was perceived as more able and benevolent than the impersonal chatbot. It was also more anthropomorphized and led to greater usage intentions, but not to greater trust. Anthropomorphism, not trust, explained the greater intentions to use personalized AI. We discuss implications for research on trust in humans and in automation. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

This audience-congruent recall bias has been explained as the result of the communicators’ creation of a shared reality with the audience, which helps communicators to achieve epistemic needs for confident judgments and knowledge. Drawing on the “Relevance Of A Representation” (ROAR) model of cognitive accessibility from motivational truth relevance, we argue that shared reality increases the accessibility of information consistent (vs. inconsistent) with the audience’s attitude. We tested this prediction with a novel reaction time task in three experiments employing the saying-is-believing paradigm. Faster reactions to audience-consistent (vs. audience-inconsistent) information were found for trait information but not for behavioral information. Thus, an audience-congruent accessibility bias emerged at the level at which impressions and judgments of other persons are typically organized. Consistent with a shared-reality account, the audience-consistent accessibility bias correlated with experienced shared reality with the audience about the target person and with epistemic trust in the audience. These findings support the view that the creation of shared reality with an audience triggers a basic cognitive mechanism that facilitates the retrieval of audience-congruent (vs. audience-incongruent) trait information about a target person. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We show in three experiments that this process of attentional prioritization is critically modulated by the degree of uncertainty in these previous experiences. Participants completed a visual search task in which they made a saccade to a target to earn a monetary reward. The color of a color-singleton distractor in the search array signaled the reward outcome(s) that were available, with different degrees of variance (uncertainty). Participants were never required to look at the colored distractor, and doing so would slow their response to the target. Nevertheless, across all experiments, participants were more likely to look at distractors associated with high outcome variance versus low outcome variance. This pattern was observed when all distractors had equal expected value (Experiment 1), when the difference in variance was opposed by a difference in expected value (i.e., the high-variance distractor had a low expected value, and vice versa: Experiment 2), and when high- and low-variance distractors were paired with the maximum-value outcome on an equal proportion of trials (Experiment 3). Our findings demonstrate that experience of prediction error plays a fundamental role in guiding “attentional exploration,” wherein priority is driven by the potential for a stimulus to reduce future uncertainty through a process of learning, as opposed to maximizing current information gain. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

If object space contributes to human visual cognition, this should have a measurable effect on object discrimination abilities. We administered an object foraging task to a large, diverse sample (N = 511). We focused on the stubby animate-looking “face quadrant” of object space given known variations in face discrimination abilities. Stimuli were picked out of tens of thousands of images to either match or not match with the coordinates of faces in object space. Results show that individual differences in face perception can to a large part be explained by variability in general object perception abilities (o-factor). However, additional variability in face processing can be attributed to visual similarity with faces as captured by dimensions of object space; people who struggle with telling apart faces also have difficulties with discriminating other objects with the same object space attributes. This study is consistent with a contribution of object space to human visual cognition. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, the mechanism for integrating these complex multimodal events is unclear. For example, it is possible that predictive temporal relationships are important for multimodal event understanding, but it is also possible that this form of understanding arises more from meaningful causal between-event links that are temporally unspecified. This latter approach might be supported by a cognitive temporal window within which multimodal event information integrates flexibly with few default commitments about specific temporal relationships. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the consequences of disrupting temporal relationships between instructors’ actions and their speech in both narrated screen-capture instructional videos (Experiment 1) and live-action instructional videos (Experiment 2) by displacing the audio channel forward or backward relative to the video by 0, 1, 3, or 7 s. We assessed learning, event segmentation, disruption awareness, segmentation uncertainty, and perceived workload. Across two experiments, 7-s temporal disruptions consistently increased uncertainty and workload and decreased learning in Experiment 2. None of these effects appeared for 3-s disruptions, which were barely detectable. One-second disruptions produced no effects and were undetectable, even though much intraevent information falls within this range.

This phenomenon has been explained through two prominent theories: a dissonance account, which suggests that it results from the decision maker’s attempt to minimize an unpleasant emotional–motivational state of “dissonance,” and an inference account, which posits that it reflects a process of inferring and updating one’s “true” preferences. In the current research, we investigate whether, how, and why framing a decision as a choice or a rejection influences decision-induced preference modulation. Across 13 preregistered experiments, including seven (N = 6,248 participants from North America and Asia) reported in the main text, we find that reject-framed decisions between attractive options induce greater postdecision preference modulation (i.e., a larger preference gap between options) than choose-framed decisions, all else equal. Supporting the inference account, the effect is moderated by attribute similarity and choice set valence while being mediated consistently by perceived action diagnosticity. In contrast, purported moderators and process measures of the dissonance account received no support when tested. Additionally, we systematically address potential confounds associated with varying levels of “noise” in preference expression through decisions, an issue that had encumbered previous paradigms on preference modulation. Our findings suggest that changes in preference induced by ordinary day-to-day decisions primarily stem from an ongoing process of information inference and updating rather than dissonance reduction. This research also provides insights into the previously unforeseen consequences of framing interventions in policy and business. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Supporting this premise, a highly cited work by Parise and Spence (2009; n = 12) reported worse temporal order judgement performance for audiovisual stimuli with congruent compared to incongruent sound–shape associations.

Additionally, frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses found no evidence against the null hypothesis, revealing a negligible effect size.

Negative feedback situations offer an intriguing context to study the interplay of emotionregulation goals (wanting to feel better) and performance goals (wanting to perform better). Across five preregistered online studies (N = 1,087), we investigated emotion-regulation choice (i.e., whether and how to regulate) in feedback situations. Challenging the assumption that the goal to perform better is the focal goal in negative-feedback situations, we show that negative feedback increases the salience of the goal to feel better via negative affect in Studies 1–2. Moving beyond the question of whether people regulate their emotions when they receive negative feedback, we examined how they regulate their emotions in Studies 3–5. Focusing on the relative importance of the goals to feel and to perform better, we found that the goal to perform better but not the goal to feel better influences negative-feedback recipients’ emotion-regulation strategy choice. A salient goal to perform better was associated with a preference for reappraisal over distraction. These results have critical implications for the emotion-regulation literature and models of feedback processing from an emotion-regulation perspective. They demonstrate that affect-oriented processes such as emotion regulation operate when people receive negative feedback. They also highlight the importance of studying alternative goals given their relevance for how people regulate their emotions. From a practical standpoint, the findings may help us to better understand why people sometimes fail to perform better following negative feedback. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Not only is the “native English speaker” criterion poorly defined, but it also excludes historically underrepresented groups from speech perception research, often without attention to whether this exclusion is likely to affect study outcomes. The purpose of this study is to empirically test whether and how using different inclusion criteria (“native English speakers” vs. “nonnative English speakers”) affects several well-known phenomena in speech perception research. Five hundred participants completed word (N = 200) and sentence (N = 300) identification tasks in quiet and in moderate levels of background noise. Results indicate that multiple classic findings in speech perception research—including the effects of noise level, lexical density, and semantic context on speech intelligibility—persist regardless of “native English” speaking status. However, the magnitude of some of these effects differed across participant groups. Taken together, these results suggest that researchers should carefully consider whether native speaker status is likely to affect outcomes and make decisions about inclusion criteria on a study-by-study basis. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, we found that listener’s initial expectations of what social properties were predictive of linguistic variation differed, impacting overall performance. First, participants were much more likely to assume that a phonological variant was predicted by a social property than a nonsocial property (Experiment 1). Most interestingly, participants were more likely to privilege speaker race than sex/gender, but only in the case of a phonological variant (Experiments 2 and 3). The same effect was found in both White and Black participants, though White participants were more likely to correctly articulate which speaker characteristic explained the variation, suggesting that sociolinguistic learning hinges on real-world experiences with language and social diversity. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We tested whether reducing the quantity of social media use, relative to improving the way users engage with social media, benefits psychological well-being. Participants were 393 social media users (ages 17–29) in Canada, with elevated psychopathology symptoms, who perceived social media to negatively impact their life somewhat. They were randomized to either (a) assistance to engage with social media in a way to enhance connectedness (tutorial), (b) encouragement to abstain from social media (abstinence), or (c) no instructions to change behavior (control). Participants’ social media behaviors were self-reported and tracked using phone screen time apps while well-being was self-reported, over four timepoints (6 weeks in total). Results suggested that the tutorial and abstinence groups, relative to control, reduced their quantity of social media use and the amount of social comparisons they made on social media, with abstinence being the most effective. Tutorial was the only condition to reduce participants’ fear of missing out and loneliness, and abstinence was the only condition to reduce internalizing symptoms, relative to control. No condition differences emerged in eating pathology or the tendency to make social comparisons in an upward direction. Changes in social media behaviors mediated the effects of abstinence (but not of tutorial) on well-being outcomes. Participant engagement and perceptions of helpfulness were acceptable, but the abstinence group possibly perceived the content as less helpful. In conclusion, using social media differently and abstaining from social media may each benefit well-being. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

This effect of fiction reading was moderated by the comparison group (effects were greater when reading fiction was compared with watching fiction or reading nothing than when reading fiction was compared with reading nonfiction) and the outcome variable (significant effects emerged for empathy and mentalizing only). In Meta-Analysis 2 (559 effect sizes/114 studies reporting correlations), lifetime exposure to print fiction was linked with significant small-sized cognitive benefits, r =.16, 95% CI [0.13, 0.19]. This effect was moderated by outcome variable (effects were greatest for verbal abilities, followed by general cognitive abilities and empathy/mentalizing/ outgroup judgments), fictionality of the print material (greater effects were found for fiction than nonfiction), publication status (published work exhibited greater effects than unpublished work), type of assessment measure (larger effects emerged when neither the outcome nor print exposure were assessed via self-report, than when either the outcome or print exposure were assessed via self-report), participant group (community samples showed greater effects than student samples), study design (greater effects were found for correlational than for experimental designs), and percentage of female participants (via a negative relationship with cognitive benefits).

We introduce a new empirical paradigm for studying naturalistic active learning, as well as new computational tools for jointly modeling algorithmic and rational theories of information search. Participants in our task can ask questions and learn about hundreds of everyday items but must retrieve queried items from memory. To maximize information gain, participants need to retrieve sequences of dissimilar items. In eight experiments (N = 795), we find that participants are unable to do this. Instead, associative memory mechanisms lead to the successive retrieval of similar items, an established memory effect known as semantic congruence. The extent of semantic congruence (and thus suboptimality in question asking) is unaffected by task instructions and incentives, though participants can identify efficient query sequences when given a choice between query sequences. Overall, our results indicate that participants can distinguish between optimal and suboptimal search if explicitly asked to do so, but have difficulty implementing optimal search from memory. We conclude that associative memory processes may place critical restrictions on people’s ability to ask good questions in naturalistic active learning tasks. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

A sample of 217 Black participants with background in a STEM discipline viewed a mock academic department website which presented varied combinations of expressed diversity cues (diversity vs. neutral mission statement) and/or evidence-based diversity cues (racially diverse vs. all-White faculty). Participants reported perceptions of the department’s DEI culture, their own perceived fit within the program, and belief of future personal success within that institution. Results indicated a significant main effect of evidence-based cue, in the form of faculty diversity, on all examined outcomes, with Black participants more positively assessing a program exhibiting this cue.

In Experiment 1 (moral judgments; n = 106), D.R. elementary schoolers and adults evaluated judges who accepted gifts from contestants before or after selecting contest winners and predicted whether bribe-taking judges would be secretive. Like adults, older—but not younger—D.R. elementary schoolers differentially condemned judges who accepted gifts before versus after picking contest winners. Unlike adults, children often predicted that judges would disclose receiving gifts. In Experiment 2 (moral behaviors; n = 44), D.R. elementary schoolers could secretly accept or reject a bribe in exchange for 1st place while judging a drawing contest. All but two children rejected the bribe. Together, these findings stand in contrast with U.S. bribery-related developmental trends (Reyes-Jaquez & Koenig, 2021, 2022) and support this contention: When growing up in a more morally heterogeneous context like the D.R., children eventually assume a critical and differentiated stance toward—and will resist or subvert—some of their culture’s unethical practices. Greater exposure to a wide range of unethical transactions might hinder aspects of bribery-related moral development early on, depending on how these aspects are measured (moral judgment vs. behavior). Nevertheless, over time, such exposure may strengthen children’s capacity to resist unethical cultural practices, indicated by children’s overwhelming rejection of bribes. We discuss the importance of including diverse response modalities (verbal, behavioral) when measuring psychological constructs in non-Western societies. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Introducing a new method to this field, Lähteenmäki et al. (2015) claimed that affective priming requires awareness. Specifically, they administered a subjective rating task after the priming task in each trial to directly assess awareness of the prime. Their main result was a lack of priming for subjectively unaware primes. In four experiments, we compared their method with the traditional paradigm, that is, a single-task priming phase followed by a direct test of prime recognition. We used faces with anger versus sadness expressions as primes and targets; emotion categorization was the task. In contrast to Lähteenmäki et al., primes and targets were drawn from different sets, such that priming effects can be unequivocally attributed to the processing of evaluative features. In Experiments 1a, b, we followed their approach of using different prime durations to produce variance in awareness ratings. With a duration of 40 ms, significant priming effects for subjectively unaware primes were found. This duration was also associated with priming effects in the traditional paradigm with near-zero objective prime categorization, suggesting that priming does not require awareness. In Experiment 2a, employing a constant 40-ms duration, we replicated the traditional effect. However, the parallel Experiment 2b with subjective awareness ratings produced a null result at a sharply increased response time level. We conclude that the claim that affective processing requires awareness is not justified. Subjective trial-by-trial visibility ratings can severely alter processing strategies in response priming paradigms. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Here we ask whether such event types are extracted spontaneously during visual perception, even when entirely task irrelevant during passive viewing. We exploited the phenomenon of categorical perception-wherein differences are more readily noticed when they are represented in terms of different underlying categories. Observers were better at detecting changes to images or short videos when the changes involved switches in the underlying event type-even when the changes that maintained the same event type were objectively larger (in terms of both brute image metrics and higher level feature change). We observed this categorical ""cross-event-type"" advantage for visual working memory for twisting versus rotating, scooping versus pouring, and rolling versus bouncing. Moreover, additional control experiments confirmed that such effects could not be explained by appeal to lower-level non-categorical stimulus differences. This spontaneous perception of ""visual verbs"" might promote both generalization and prediction about how events are likely to unfold.

The present research assesses the magnitude, manifestations, and predictors of these phenomena, while addressing methodological concerns in past research. We conducted a preregistered study with a split-sample design (discovery sample N = 630, validation sample N = 1,100) of U.S. Census-matched online adults. Proponents and opponents of 2020 U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump were presented with fake and real political headlines ahead of the election. The political concordance of the headlines determined participants' belief in and intention to share news more than the truth of the headlines. This ""concordance-over-truth"" bias persisted across education levels, analytic reasoning ability, and partisan groups, with some evidence of a stronger effect among Trump supporters. Resistance to true news was stronger than susceptibility to fake news. The most robust predictors of the bias were participants' belief in the relative objectivity of their political side, extreme views about Trump, and the extent of their one-sided media consumption. Interestingly, participants stronger in analytic reasoning, measured with the Cognitive Reflection Task, were more accurate in discerning real from fake headlines when accurate conclusions aligned with their ideology. Finally, participants remembered fake headlines more than real ones regardless of the political concordance of the news story. Discussion explores why the concordance-over-truth bias observed in our study is more pronounced than previous research suggests, and examines its causes, consequences, and potential remedies.

We investigated whether, in processing visual scenes, role assignment is accomplished automatically (i.e., when the task does not require it), based on visuospatial information, without requiring semantic or linguistic encoding of the stimuli. Human adults saw a series of images featuring the same male and female actors next to each other, one in an agentlike (more dynamic/ leaning forward) and the other in a patientlike (static/less dynamic) posture. Participants indicated the side (left/right) of a target actor (i.e., the woman). From trial to trial, body postures changed, but the roles, defined by the type of posture, sometimes changed, sometimes not. We predicted that if participants spontaneously saw the actors as agent and patient, they should be slower to respond when roles switched from trial n − 1 to trial n, than when they stayed the same (role switch cost). Results confirmed this hypothesis (Experiments 1–3). A role switch cost was also found when roles were defined by another visual relational cue, the relative positioning (where one actor stands relative to another), but not when actors were presented in isolation (Experiments 4–6). These findings reveal a mechanism for automatic role assignment based on encoding of visual relational information in social (multiple-person) scenes. Since we found that roles in one trial affected the processing of the subsequent trial despite variations in postures and spatial relations, this mechanism must be one that assigns entities in a scene, to the abstract categories of agent and patient. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Does it? Across 11 studies, including a field study of medical professionals, predictors overestimated the rate at which people course correct following failure (Studies 1–4). Predictors overestimated the likelihood that professionals who fail a professional exam (e.g., the bar exam, the medical boards) pass a retest (Studies 1a, 1b, and 2a), the likelihood that patients improve their health after a crisis (e.g., heart attack, drug overdose; Studies 2b and 6), and the probability, more generally, of learning from one’s mistakes (Studies 3–5). This effect was specific to overestimating success following failure (Study 4) and erasing mention of an initial failure that had actually occurred corrected the problem (Studies 2a and 2b). The success overestimate was due, at least in part, to the belief that people attend to failure more than they do (Studies 5 and 6). Correcting this overestimate had policy implications.

However, recent findings challenge the notion that aging leads to global impairments in inhibition. To reconcile these mixed findings, we investigated how aging modulates multiple mechanisms of attentional control by tracking the timing and direction of eye movements. When engaged in feature-search mode and proactive distractor suppression, older adults made fewer first fixations to the target but inhibited the task-irrelevant salient distractor as effectively as did young adults. However, when engaged in singleton-search mode and required to reactively disengage from the distractor, older adults made significantly more first saccades toward the task-irrelevant salient distractor and showed increased fixation times in orienting to the target, longer dwell times on incorrect saccades, and increased saccadic reaction times compared with young adults. Our findings reveal that aging differently impairs attentional control depending on whether visual search requires proactive distractor suppression or reactive distractor disengagement. Furthermore, our oculomotor measures reveal both age-related deficits and age equivalence in various mechanisms of attention, including goal-directed orienting, selection history, disengagement, and distractor inhibition. These findings help explain why conclusions of age-related declines or age equivalence in mechanisms of attentional control are task specific and reveal that older adults do not exhibit global impairments in mechanisms of inhibition. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Across four experiments, we explore how contextual influences shape perceptions of diversity, including what happens when information at different contextual levels conflicts. In Study 1 (N = 160) and Study 2 (N = 69, preregistered), we find that when participants believe White women, White men, and Black men to be overrepresented in a profession at the national level, individuals with those identities are rated as contributing less to the diversity of a group of workers within that profession. In Study 3 (N = 164), participants were asked to make diversity judgments within the same profession (American elementary school teachers), but the composition of the target group under evaluation was either White female-dominated (aligned with the profession) or White male-dominated (diverged from the profession). Presenting the group as White male-dominated (compared to White female-dominated) increased perceptions of White women’s contributions to diversity and decreased perceptions of White men’s, and men of color’s, contributions to diversity. In Study 4 (N = 216, preregistered), we attempted to call participants’ attention to representation at a single level only (i.e., national vs. target group), when representation information conflicted across levels. However, perceived contributions to diversity did not shift based on experimental conditions. It appears that Americans’ judgments of who increases a group’s diversity can be affected by representation at multiple levels, although it may be difficult for perceivers to prioritize one contextual level only when such information conflicts. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Memory content may be biased away from veridical when it is functionally adaptive. So far, research has considered the biasing of still features in static displays. It is unknown whether the biasing of attentional templates can functionally adapt dynamic stimuli to facilitate search when targets and distractors compete within temporally extended contexts. Biasing of dynamic templates would require learning and modulatory mechanisms capable of abstracting over space and time to guide perception. Four experiments used a novel dynamic visual search task combined with a memory probe to test whether dynamic attentional templates can be biased. In Experiments 1–3, participants searched for a moving target among distractors that systematically moved either clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the target. On memory probe trials, participants recalled the target direction as biased away from the distractors. The distortion bias was adaptively changed (Experiment 2), grew over time (Experiment 2), and occurred even when motion direction was not the target-defining feature (Experiment 3). Experiment 4 manipulated the speed of targets and distractors to test the generalizability of the findings. Participants searched for a target of a given speed among faster or slower distractors. Memory probing revealed that participants remembered the target speed as biased away from that of distractors. Across different tasks, the magnitude of the biasing correlated positively with search performance. Our findings provide compelling evidence that dynamic stimulus attributes in attentional templates can become functionally biased when adaptive. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

Here, we investigate how social group membership provides such a context, comparing attractiveness judgments between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) versus straight perceivers, and examining how these attractiveness judgments relate to beliefs about the target person’s sexual orientation. We indeed find that perceivers rate targets as more attractive when they believe the target’s sexual majority/minority status matches their own (Study 1). This association differs according to context, however: Although straight and LGB perceivers evaluate the components of facial attractiveness similarly (Study 2), straight men use attractiveness as a cue to sexual orientation (i.e., deeming unattractive women lesbians; Study 3) whereas LGB perceivers use sexual orientation as a cue to attractiveness (e.g., gay men rate men they believe are gay as more attractive than men they believe are straight; Studies 4 and 5). Thus, LGB identity seems to create a context in which sexual minority perceivers learn to attend to information about sexual diversity that straight perceivers may ignore. These findings highlight how group membership provides a lens for social perception, specifically pointing to how the contextual mindset of partner selection may transmute otherwise objective judgments, such as facial attractiveness. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

But even without a pencil, you might naturally find yourself mentally tracing along various paths. This “mental path tracing” may intuitively seem to depend on your (overt, conscious, voluntary) goal of wanting to get out of the maze, but might it also occur spontaneously—as a result of simply seeing the maze, via a kind of dynamic visual routine? Here, observers simply had to compare the visual properties of two probes presented in a maze. The maze itself was entirely task irrelevant, but we predicted that simply seeing the maze’s visual structure would “afford” incidental mental path tracing (à la Gibson). Across four experiments, observers were slower to compare probes that were further from each other along the paths, even when controlling for lower level properties (such as the probes’ brute linear separation, ignoring the maze “walls”). These results also generalized beyond mazes to other unfamiliar displays with task-irrelevant circular obstacles. This novel combination of two prominent themes from our field—affordances and visual routines—suggests that at least some visual routines may not require voluntary goals; instead, they may operate in an automatic (incidental, stimulus-driven) fashion, as a part of visual processing itself. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Psychologists currently answer such questions with psychometric methods, which analyze correlations across participant responses in survey data sets. In this article, we analyze the preferences that give rise to these correlations. Our approach uses (a) large language models (LLMs) to quantify everyday risky behaviors in terms of the attributes or reasons that may describe those behaviors, and (b) decision models to map these attributes and reasons onto participant responses. We show that LLM-based decision models can explain observed correlations between behaviors in terms of the reasons different behaviors elicit and explain observed correlations between individuals in terms of the weights different individuals place on reasons, thereby providing a decision theoretic foundation for psychometric findings. Since LLMs can generate quantitative representations for nearly any naturalistic decision, they can be used to make accurate out-of-sample predictions for hundreds of everyday behaviors, predict the reasons why people may or may not want to engage in these behaviors, and interpret these reasons in terms of core psychological constructs. Our approach has important theoretical and practical implications for the study of heterogeneity in everyday behavior. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Such high confidence miss (HCM) responses have been taken as evidence of rapid and complete forgetting and of everyday amnesia (Roediger & Tekin, 2020). We investigated (a) if memory for HCMs is completely lost or whether a residual memory effect exists and (b) whether dominant decision models predict the effect. Participants studied faces (Experiments 1a, 2, and 3) or words (Experiment 1b), then completed a singleitem recognition memory task, followed by either (a) a two-alternative forced-choice recognition task, in which the studied and nonstudied alternatives on each trial were matched for their previous old/new decision and confidence rating (Experiments 1 and 2) or (b) a second single-item recognition task in which the targets and foils were HCMs and high confidence correct rejections, respectively (Experiment 3). In each experiment, participants reliably distinguishedHCMs from high-confidence correct rejections. The unequal variance signal detection and dual-process signal detection models were fit to the single-item recognition data, and the parameter estimates were used to predict the memory effect for HCMs. The dual-process signal detection model predicted the residual memory effect (as did another popular model, the mixture signal detection theory model). However, the unequal variance signal detection model incorrectly predicted a negative, or no, effect, invalidating this model. The residual memory effect for HCMs demonstrates that everyday amnesia is not associated with complete memory loss and distinguishes between decision models. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

For instance, people rapidly learn to pay attention to locations that frequently contain visual search targets. Here, we investigated how frequently finding specific objects as search targets influences attentional selection during real-world object search. We investigated how learning that a specific object (e.g., a coat) is task-relevant affects searching for that object and whether a previously frequent target would influence search more broadly for all items of that target’s category (e.g., all coats). Across five experiments, one or more objects from a single category were likely targets during a training phase, after which objects from many categories became equally likely to be targets in a neutral testing phase. Participants learned to find a single frequent target object faster than other objects (Experiment 1, N = 44). This learning was specific to that object, with no advantage in finding a novel category-matched object (Experiment 2, N = 32). In contrast, learning to prioritize multiple exemplars from one category spread to untrained objects from the same category, and this spread was comparable whether participants learned to find two, four, or six exemplars (Experiment 3, N = 72). These differences in the breadth of attention were due to variability in the learning environment and not differences in task (Experiment 4, N = 24). Finally, a set-size manipulation showed that learning affects attentional guidance itself, not only postselective processing (Experiment 5, N = 96).

Drawing from motivational intensity theory and the expected value of control framework, we hypothesized that control intensity would increase with task difficulty until a maximum tolerable level, after which it would decrease. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted two experiments utilizing Stroop-like conflict tasks, systematically manipulating the number of distractors to vary task difficulty. We assessed control adaptation and measured subjective task difficulty. Our results revealed a curvilinear pattern between perceived task difficulty and adaptation of control.

How does imagining others shift the self? We propose that the activation of self-knowledge is the key factor by which simulation of others alters one’s self-concept. We test this possibility across four studies that each manipulate self-knowledge activation indirectly during simulation and measure the impact on subsequent self-ratings. Results demonstrate that increasing activation of self-knowledge during simulation is associated with increased self-concept change. People experienced greater self-concept change when simulating similar others (Studies 1 and 2). People also generalized simulation-induced changes to aspects of the self-concept that were semantically similar to the simulated content (Study 3). Finally, people who are less likely to recruit self-knowledge (i.e., older adults) during simulation were less susceptible to selfconcept change (Study 4). These studies highlight self-knowledge activation as an essential component of the effects of simulation on self-rated change. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

An attentional set for a target feature can be established through statistical learning of probabilistic target associations; however, whether an array of attentional sets of predictive target features can be established during intentional learning, and how they might guide attention, is not known yet. To address these questions, we had human observers perform a visual search task where we instructed them to try to use color to find their target shape. We structured the task with a fine-grained statistical regularity such that the target shapes appeared in different colors with five unique probabilities (i.e., 33%, 26%, 19%, 12%, and 5%) while we recorded their electroencephalogram. Observers rapidly learned these regularities, evidenced by being faster to report targets that appeared in higher probability colors. These effects were not due to unequal sample sizes or simple feature priming. More importantly, equivalent speeding across a set of high-probability colors suggests that the brain was driving attention to multiple targets simultaneously. Our electrophysiological results showed larger amplitude N2 posterior contralateral component, indexing perceptual attention, and late positive complex (LPC) component, indexing postperceptual processes, for targets paired with high-probability colors. These electrophysiological data suggest that the learned attentional sets change both perceptual selection and how postperceptual decisions are made. In sum, we show that multiple attentional sets can be established during intentional learning that accompanies general task acquisition and that these attentional sets can simultaneously guide attention by enhancing both perceptual attention and postperceptual processes. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, a fundamental variable in Fitts’ Law—the movement distance, D—confounds two quantities: The physical distance the effector has to move to reach a goal, and the visually perceived distance to that goal. While these two quantities are functionally equivalent in everyday motor behavior, decoupling them might improve our understanding of the factors that shape speed–accuracy tradeoffs. Here, we leveraged the phenomenon of visuomotor gain adaptation to de-confound movement and visual distance during goal-directed reaching. We found that movement distance and visual distance can influence movement times, supporting a variant of Fitts’ Law that considers both. The weighting of movement versus visual distance was modified by restricting movement range and degrading visual feedback.

Research thus far has not identified particular visual features that can sufficiently explain this intrinsic memorability, but one possibility is that more and less memorable images differ in their statistical regularity (i.e., how proto-typical or distinctive they are). Statistical regularity is known to affect detection time for images, such that stimuli with higher statistical regularity can be detected with shorter presentation directions. Therefore, in the present study, we probed whether memorability affects how quickly an image can be detected. High- and low-memorability images were presented in an intact/scrambled task wherein participants were asked to indicate whether they saw an intact image or noise, and we estimated the presentation duration necessary for participants to reach 70.7% accuracy. Across two experiments using different stimulus materials, we observed and then replicated that more memorable images are associated with shorter detection thresholds than those for less memorable images.

According to PCP, one can argue that self-label, self-shape, and the “yes, match” responses are all + polar (hence full correspondence is given), whereas other label and other shape are both – polar, which does not correspond to the + polarity of the “yes” response. Our argument is based on a structural analogy of the self-matching task with an experiment by Seymour (1969)—a pillar of the PCP—who conducted an experiment where participants determined if the location of a dot (above or below a rectangle) matched the word (“above” or “below”) presented within the rectangle. Faster reactions occurred in above–above matching trials than in below–below or nonmatching trials. We replicated this finding (Experiment 1A) and showed the close analogy to the self-matching task by replicating the SPE with a single “other” category. In Experiment 2, we showed that the SPE disappears if participants are instructed to respond with “no” to matches. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 2 with two instead of one “other” category (which is more common in SPE research). Again, the SPE in the “yes” condition significantly exceeded the one in the “no” condition. However, the latter SPE was still significant, suggesting that part of the SPE might be due to the PCP, but a small self-related effect remains. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Similar to other networks, the semantic network exhibits a modular structure characterized by modules with dense internal connections and sparse connections between them. This organizational principle facilitates the routine storage and retrieval of information but may impede creativity. The present study investigated the effect of hub concepts with varying connection patterns on creative thinking from the perspective of a modular structured semantic network. By analyzing a large-scale semantic network, connector hubs (C-hubs) and provincial hubs (P-hubs) were identified based on their intra- and intermodule connections. These hubs were used as cue words in the alternative uses task, a widely used measure of creative thinking. Across four experiments, behavioral and neural evidence indicated that C-hubs facilitate the generation of more novel and remote ideas compared to P-hubs. However, this effect is predominantly observed in the early stage of the creative thinking process, involving changes in brain activation and functional connectivity in core regions of the default mode network and the frontoparietal network, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, and precuneus. Neural findings suggest that the superior performance of C-hubs relies on stronger interactions between automatic spreading activation, controlled semantic retrieval, and attentional regulation of salient information. These results provide insight into how concepts with varying semantic connection patterns facilitate and constrain different stages of the creative thinking process through the modular structure of semantic network. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We did this with a generalization method: Preschoolers learn about one agent’s actions and then are asked what they think a new agent will do. Low rates of generalization suggest children inferred something unique to an individual, while high rates suggest that children inferred that the action represented socially shared knowledge. In a mixed between- and within-participant design, children observed agents demonstrate sequences of statistically random (or nonrandom, between participants) actions that were verbally framed as relevant to a particular domain (agent’s personal preferences, labels, object functions, or game rules). We found that children’s social generalizations about actions were on a continuum: with linguistic conventions (e.g., labels) being the most social, preferences being the most personal, and nonlinguistic conventions (i.e., object functions, game rules) falling somewhere in between. Furthermore, the influence of statistical evidence and cultural variation varied for each domain. These findings highlight how children combine knowledge and evidence to infer social meaning from actions and have implications for rational constructivist accounts of cultural learning. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

A conceivable strategy that apparently takes favorable aspects of both approaches on board is to use traditional frequentist analyses first and to support theoretically interesting nil effects by Bayesian analyses thereafter. Here, we asked whether such a selective application of Bayesian analyses to only nonsignificant effects of foregoing frequentist analyses creates bias. In two simulation studies, we observed that such selective application of Bayesian analyses, in fact, severely overestimates evidence in favor of the null hypotheses, when a true population effect exists. While this bias can be attenuated by using more informative priors in the Bayesian analyses, we recommend to not apply such selective combination of analytical approaches, but instead to use either frequentist or Bayesian analyses consistently. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Analytic and holistic cognitive styles were estimated using reaction time modeling, specifically a Bayesian fourparameter shifted Wald distribution and a hierarchical linear ballistic accumulator model. The results revealed notable cross-cultural variations in cognitive styles, though these differences did not align with predictions from analytic/holistic cognitive style theory. Countries traditionally characterized as more holistic or analytic did not consistently show the expected cognitive style patterns. Multilevel modeling examined the influence of country-level variables, such as Hofstede’s and Schwartz’s cultural dimensions. While some dimensions, like individualism and long-term orientation, were associated with both analytic and holistic thinking, many cultural predictors had no significant impact on cognitive styles. Additionally, exploratory latent profile analysis assessed cognitive metastyles, such as flexibility and rigidity, but the findings do not support the presence of a rigidity metastyle. No profiles exhibited a strong preference for one cognitive dimension while showing a low preference for the other.

Although there is agreement that emotion enhances memory for individual items, how it influences memory for the associated contextual details (relational memory, RM) remains debated. The prevalent view suggests that emotion impairs RM, but there is also evidence that emotion enhances RM. To reconcile these diverging results, we carried out three studies incorporating the following features: (1) testing RM with increased specificity, distinguishing between subjective (recollection based) and objective (item–context match) RM accuracy, (2) accounting for emotion–attention interactions via eye-tracking and task manipulation, and (3) using stimuli with integrated item–context content. Challenging the prevalent view, we identified both enhancing and impairing effects. First, emotion enhanced subjective RM, separately and when confirmed by accurate objective RM. Second, emotion impaired objective RM through attention capturing, but it enhanced RM accuracy when attentional effects were statistically accounted for using eye-tracking data. Third, emotion also enhanced RM when participants were cued to focus on contextual details during encoding, likely by increasing item–context binding. Finally, functional magnetic resonance imaging data recorded from a subset of participants showed that emotional enhancement of RM was associated with increased activity in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, along with increased intra-MTL and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex–MTL functional connectivity. Overall, these findings reconcile evidence regarding opposing effects of emotion on RM and point to possible training interventions to increase RM specificity in healthy functioning, posttraumatic stress disorder, and aging, by promoting item–context binding and diminishing memory decontextualization. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Racecraft ideology assumes the reality of race(s), an assumption that shapes study designs and inferences to the detriment of theoretical and practical goals. I showcase how racecraft manifests in studies seeking to quantify how perceptions of sociopolitical stimuli differ across racialized perceivers (e.g., black, white, latinx). The typical analysis for quantifying perceptions focuses on comparing group averages, which assumes the existence of discrete “races” whose perceptions can be sufficiently summarized by averages. Across three studies, I used variance component analyses on racism ratings of anti-immigrant tweets from differently racialized perceivers (N = 1,211) to show there was much larger disagreement than agreement within race categories, even when there were average differences in perceptions across race categories. This analysis shows how analytic practices can bolster different assumptions about the nature of race, some of which reify the illusion that race categories are stable cohesive groups. Researchers can improve their analytic inferences and avoid producing race-reifying caricatures of peoples’ perceptions by adding variance mapping to their toolkits and attending to racialization as a dynamic process—needed improvements within the psychological study of race and racism, group-based beliefs, and antiracist research endeavors. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Ghosting—the act of ending a relationship by ignoring another person’s attempts to connect—is a common way of ending social ties. The present experiments first establish the key characteristics of ghosting and distinguish it from other rejection behaviors (Pilot Studies 1a–1c). The experiments then proceed to explore the relational and motivational implications of this behavior, finding that ghosters (those who ghost) care about the well-being of ghostees (those who are ghosted) more than ghostees realize. This result occurs in recalled instances of ghosting (Experiment 1), when ghosting in real time (Experiment 2), and when refraining from ghosting is monetarily costly (Experiment 3). We find that this occurs partly because ghostees underestimate the other-oriented motives involved in ghosting, misunderstanding that ghosters ghost partly as a way to end a tie while avoiding hurting ghostees’ feelings (Experiments 4–6). Indeed, greater other-oriented motives lead to a higher likelihood of ghosting others (Experiment 7). A final experiment finds relational consequences whereby ghostees miss out on opportunities for future help exchange due to their underestimation of the extent to which ghosters care about them (Experiment 8). Ghosting is social rejection without explanation or feedback, but not without care. This study highlights how prosocial motives can drive rejection behaviors and the role of interpersonal accuracy in mitigating the negative effects of social rejection. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, there is individual variability in the slope of this decline. Recent work suggests that indices of cognitive control are mediated by communicative demands of the language environment. However, little is known about how the impact of bilingual experience generalizes across the lifespan, particularly in females who exhibit steeper cognitive decline due to increasing age and menopausal transition. Thus, we investigated whether diversity of language use in distinct communicative contexts modulated the effects of aging and menopause on cognitive control in an adult lifespan sample of healthy females. We performed robust linear regressions on a sample of 120 females (age range 20–65 years) to characterize age- (n = 120) and menopause-related (n = 59) declines in cognitive control (as assessed by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) and to determine whether they are modulated by different facets of bilingual language experience, including the diversity of language use (i.e., language entropy) in home and workplace environments. Workplace but not home language diversity modulated age- and menopause-related declines in cognitive control, suggesting that females may compensate for decline by virtue of adapting to the externally imposed demands of the language environment. These findings have implications for identifying which aspects of bilingual experience may contribute to cognitive reserve in healthy aging. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Task switching requires replacing the previously active task representation with a new one, an operation that typically results in a switch cost. Thus, understanding cognitive flexibility requires understanding how tasks are represented in the brain. We hypothesize that task representations are cognitive map-like, such that the magnitude of the difference between task representations reflects their conceptual differences: The greater the distinction between the two task representations, the more updating is required. This hypothesis predicts that switch costs should increase with between task dissimilarity. To test this hypothesis, we use an experimental design that parametrically manipulates the similarity between task rules.We observe that response time scales with the dissimilarity between the task rules. The findings shed light on the organizational principles of task representations and extend the conventional binary task-switch effect (task repeat vs. switch) to a theoretical framework with parametric task switches. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique context to address this question due to the intersection it created between the personal and the collective domains. In two studies (N = 273), we examined the valence and perceived agency involved in memory and future thinking for personal and collective domains. The second study also included a longitudinal component with 43 participants completing both studies. In research done prior to the pandemic, a valence-based dissociation between personal and collective events was consistently observed in Western samples. We wanted to see if these patterns changed during different stages of the pandemic. In the first study, participants no longer exhibited the usual positivity bias for the personal future, while in the second study, they did not exhibit the usual negativity bias for the collective future. The second aim of the current article was to assess the agency people attribute to themselves and their nation over events and how that relates to valence. People always attributed more agency to themselves over positive events than negative events in both personal and collective domains. Perceived nation agency, however, was associated with positivity in the collective domain but with negativity in the personal domain. Longitudinal analyses confirmed these patterns. Taken together, these results indicate that a collective crisis that has immediate and profound effects on personal lives can alter the patterns observed for mental time travel, especially for the future. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Do first impressions matter most, or is it better to end on a good note? Across nine studies (N = 569), we tested these competing intuitions and found that preferences depend on when rewards occur and when we are asked to evaluate an experience. In our “garage sale” task, participants opened boxes containing sequences of objects with values. All boxes were equally valuable, but rewards were either evenly distributed or clustered at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence. First, we tested preferences and valuation shortly after learning; we consistently found that boxes with rewards at the beginning were strongly preferred and overvalued. Object-value associative memory was impaired in boxes with early rewards, suggesting that value information was linked to the box rather than the objects. However, when tested after an overnight delay, participants equally preferred boxes with any cluster of rewards, whether at the beginning, middle, or end of the experience. Finally, we demonstrated that evaluating shortly after an experience led to lasting preferences for early rewards. Overall, we show that people summarize rewarding experiences in a nonlinear and time-dependent way, unifying prior work on affect, memory, and decision making. We propose that short-term preferences are biased by first impressions. However, when we wait and evaluate an experience after a delay, we summarize rewarding events in memory to inform adaptive longer term preferences. Preferences depend on when rewards occur and when we first evaluate an experience. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

One of the most effective strategies for understanding information is to explain it, for instance to a hypothetical other (Pilots 1 and 2). Yet, we find that learners prefer equally effortful but less effective learning strategies, even when incentivized to perform well (Study 1). Critically, we propose and find that learners’ reluctance to explain is tied to their subjective knowledge of the material; learners who feel less knowledgeable about what they learned are most reluctant to explain it, despite the strategy being as effective for them (Study 2). An intervention that increased subjective knowledge (by having learners answer a few easy questions) increased learners’ choice to explain, which was mediated by learners believing that explaining would be more pleasant and effective (Study 3). Directly manipulating beliefs about how fun and effective explaining is also boosted learners’ willingness to explain (Study 4). Finally, because Studies 1–4 incentivized performance financially, we replicated key results in the classroom with students, finding improved scores on a class quiz (Study 5). The paradoxical implication of these findings is that those who need effective learning strategies the most are the ones least likely to use them. Put together, we find that subjective knowledge plays a key role in learning decisions and that boosting subjective knowledge is a simple intervention that can improve learning-related choices. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Competing theories have opposing answers, but empirical tests are based primarily on tasks of item memory. Few studies have addressed this question with tasks measuring the binding of event components (e.g., a person and a location), which forms the core of episodic memory. None of these prior studies included older adults, whose episodic memories are less specific in nature. We addressed this critical gap by presenting face–scene pairs (e.g., an old man with a park) at various encoding presentation rates to 80 young (M = 21.83 years) and 86 older (M = 68.62 years) adults. Participants completed associative recognition tests featuring old/intact (e.g., the old man with the same park), similar (e.g., the old man with a different park), and unrelated (e.g., the old man with a kitchen) pairs. Multinomial-processing-tree model analyses revealed that young and older adults encoded each pair’s gist representation more rapidly than its specific representation, supporting fuzzy-trace theory. No age-related differences in gist representations were obtained at any presentation rate, but older adults required more time to encode specific representations commensurate with those of younger adults. However, older adults’ abilities to retrieve these representations were cue-dependent, as they were more susceptible than younger adults to experiencing vivid false memories of similar lures. These phantom recollections were remediated with further increases in encoding time. Thus, slower speed of encoding partially underlies age-related declines in episodic memory specificity, but retrieval mechanisms also play a role. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Results consistently demonstrated that when assessing happiness, faces with Duchenne compared to non-Duchenne smiles were rated as happier on both Black and White targets. However, when assessing a more socially evaluative dimension, trustworthiness, perceptions of Black and White targets diverged. Whereas White targets with Duchenne compared to non-Duchenne smiles were rated as more trustworthy, ratings of Black targets with Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiles did not differ, with both appraised as highly trustworthy. Although the degree to which Black participants identified with their race did not moderate these effects, the perceived genuineness of targets did mediate the relationship. One reason why Duchenne compared to non-Duchenne smiles on White but not Black targets were perceived as more trustworthy is because Duchenne compared to non-Duchenne smiles on White but not Black targets were perceived as more genuine. A final study extended these findings by exploring the impact of target race and smile type on partner choice. In accordance with the results related to trustworthiness ratings, Black participants selected White partners with Duchenne compared to nonDuchenne smiles more often but did not differentiate in their choice of Black partners with Duchenne versus non-Duchenne smiles. These findings underscore the importance of investigating not only diverse targets but also diverse perceivers. Our results suggest that Black perceivers use facial cues differently when rating the trustworthiness of Black and White targets and that these perceptions have important downstream consequences. © 2024 American Psychological Associatio","Article","Scopus"

However, what influences the extent of hypocrisy attribution or counts as hypocrisy may differ as a function of culture. Previous studies have shown that Westerners attribute greater hypocrisy for within-person attitude–behavior inconsistency than East Asians. Building on this, we predict that East Asians’ (vs. Westerners’) hypocrisy attribution is more heavily influenced by social relationships. Consistent with past research, this can lead to greater leniency. However, as we show, this can also result in the novel finding we present that attributions of mild-to-moderate hypocrisy are made even when no explicit within-person attitude–behavior inconsistency is present. Across six experiments, we found that Koreans (vs. participants from the United States) attributed more hypocrisy to attitude-contradicting behavior when the person enacting the behavior was not the person who stated the attitude but was someone who shared social bonds with that person (i.e., cross-person, within-relationship attitude–behavior inconsistency; “relational hypocrisy”). Specifically, Koreans attributed more hypocrisy than Americans when a child’s behavior contradicted their parent’s views (Experiments 1a and 1b) or when attitude-contradicting behavior was enacted by the child of a close friend (Experiment 2). Experiments 3–5 replicated the findings from Experiments 1–2 using additional social contexts (e.g., a spousal relationship). Supplementary analyses showed that differences in hypocrisy attribution between Americans and Koreans were mediated by cultural differences in their perceptions of shared responsibility within relationships. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Prior research indicates that early exposure to ASL among deaf signers results in more rapid and effortless recognition of biological motion than hearing nonsigners, potentially due to the expertise in deciphering complex human movements or possibly due to neuroplasticity in deaf brains. However, it remains uncertain whether this advantage stems from signed language proficiency or the experience of being deaf. To explore this, we designed three PLD tasks involving viewing randomly moving dots, identifying a person from biological motion PLDs, and determining whether right-side up and inverted PLDs depict actions involving a ball. A diverse cohort of participants (N = 224) with varying ASL fluencies and hearing statuses completed the tasks online, providing us with reaction time and accuracy data. Our results demonstrate that earlier ASL exposure is associated with accuracy, especially on complex action identification tasks. Furthermore, we discovered robust evidence for a speed-accuracy trade-off in deaf participants, in which they performed more quickly but less accurately. The speed-accuracy trade-off was evident in the most difficult task, the action identification task. Further analysis of this deaf group revealed that earlier signed language acquisition led to higher accuracy in action identification task. We conclude that age of ASL exposure and hearing status both significantly contribute to variations in biological motion perception, with implications for understanding visual expertise and cognitive processing in both deaf and signing populations.

An alternative explanation recently proposed that stereotypes can emerge when exploration is costly. Even optimal decision makers in an ideal environment can inadvertently form incorrect impressions from arbitrary encounters. However, all these existing theories essentially describe shortcuts that fail to explain the multidimensionality of stereotypes. Stereotypes of social groups have a canonical multidimensional structure, organized along dimensions of warmth and competence. We show that these dimensions and the associated stereotypes can result from feature-based exploration: When individuals make self-interested decisions based on past experiences in an environment where exploring new options carries an implicit cost and when these options share similar attributes, they are more likely to separate groups along multiple dimensions. We formalize this theory via the contextual multiarmed bandit problem, use the resulting model to generate testable predictions, and evaluate those predictions against human behavior. We evaluate this process in incentivized decisions involving as many as 20 real jobs and successfully recover the classic dimensions of warmth and competence. Further experiments show that intervening on the cost of exploration effectively mitigates bias, further demonstrating that exploration cost per se is the operating variable. Future diversity interventions may consider how to reduce exploration cost, in ways that parallel our manipulations. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

One framework for establishing racial boundaries is based on ancestry, which historically has been leveraged to create rigid racial categories, particularly with respect to being categorized as White. A second framework is based on skin tone, which can vary within families and across the lifespan, and is thus more likely to blur racial boundaries. The persistence of these distinct cultural beliefs about race requires that they be transmitted to each new generation, but there have been few cross-cultural studies on their development during childhood. Participants (5- to 12-year-old children, N = 123) were from the United States, in which the ancestry model has been more prevalent, or from Brazil, in which the skin tone model has been more prevalent. In both countries, 5- to 7-year-olds endorsed the belief that skin tone determines race, for example, by assigning biological siblings with differing skin tones to different racial categories. However, racial concepts diverged among the 10- to 12-year-olds, with children from the United States shifting toward a classification based on ancestry and children in Brazil endorsing a classification based on skin tone even more strongly with age. These differing conceptions were especially evident with reference to White racial categorization: Older children from Brazil persisted in classifying lighter skinned people as White when they had African ancestry, unlike older children from the United States. These findings provide important insights into the developmental and cultural influences on racial classification systems. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Research on pretesting has focused primarily on direct factual learning outcomes. Yet building a coherent knowledge base also depends on productive memory processes that permit going beyond the information directly given. In the specific productive process of self-derivation through memory integration, individual differences are prominent; verbal comprehension is a consistent predictor. In the current work, we integrated these research trends by testing the extent to which pretesting enhances learning through productive memory processes and the role played by individual differences in verbal comprehension. Across four within-subjects experiments, we assessed the pretest effect after accounting for variability associated with verbal comprehension. In Experiments 1–3, we assessed the productive memory process of self-derivation through memory integration. Adults were more successful on pretest trials compared to control (i.e., no pretest) trials, but this effect was no longer significant after controlling for verbal comprehension. This pattern emerged when we used stem-fact pretests (Experiment 1) and integration-fact pretests (Experiment 2) to probe self-derivation across single-sentence stimuli and replicated when we used stimuli more akin to everyday learning materials (i.e., text passages and photographs; Experiment 3). In Experiment 4, we shifted the test target from productive processes to fact recall and found the pretest effect held even after controlling for verbal comprehension. This research bridges the pretest and productive process literature to provide novel insight into ways of maximizing learning. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Learning multiple languages entails mastery of a larger and more variable range of sounds, words, syntactic structures, pragmatic conventions, and more complex mapping of linguistic information to objects in the world. Recent research suggests that bilingual learners demonstrate fundamental variation in how they explore and learn from their environment, which may derive from this increased complexity. In particular, the increased complexity and variability of bilingual environments may broaden the focus of learners’ attention, laying a different attentional foundation for learning. In this review, we introduce a novel framework, with accompanying empirical evidence, for understanding how early learners may adapt to a more complex environment, drawing on bilingualism as an example. Three adaptations, each relevant to the demands of abstracting structure from a complex environment, are introduced. Each adaptation is discussed in the context of empirical evidence attesting to shifts in basic psychological processes in bilingual learners.

Seven preregistered studies (N = 3,373) document that low (vs. high) self-concept clarity decreases moral behavior (e.g., donation, volunteering, tax compliance, honesty in an incentivized game). This effect occurs because low self-concept clarity increases moral disengagement, leading people to behave in morally questionable manners without damaging their self-concept. As evidence for this proposed underlying mechanism, we show that the effect of self-concept clarity on moral behavior is mediated by state moral disengagement and attenuates (a) among people with low trait moral disengagement, (b) among people with high trait moral identity internalization, and (c) in the presence of an honor pledge cueing moral engagement. We then show that the effect holds only when a prosocial act is congruent with personal values.

Given that older adults are more motivated to maintain interpersonal harmony relative to younger adults, older adults may be more reactive to malicious desires. In three studies, we investigated adult age differences in moral judgments and emotional reactions to sociomoral violations. In all studies, participants read scenarios in which a perpetrator either (a) desired to harm another but nothing happened, or (b) harmed another accidentally without malicious desire. Study 2 incorporated additional scenarios designed to evoke anger and disgust without explicitly implicating another person to evaluate whether age differences emerge only when sociomoral violations against another are salient. In Study 3, we examined the combined effects of malicious desires and harmful outcomes by including scenarios in which (a) harmful desires were coupled with harmful outcomes, and (b) benign desires were coupled with benign outcomes. Predominantly across the studies, older adults judged perpetrators who desired to harm another more harshly but judged perpetrators who accidentally harmed another more leniently than younger adults. Emotional reactions generally corresponded with the differences in judgments. Taken together, this work suggests that desires more strongly impact older relative to younger adults’ judgments and emotional reactions in sociomoral contexts. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

This research examines outcome uncertainty, the prevalence of different target types, and the reward value of targets in human hybrid foraging. Our empirical findings show a consistent tendency toward risk-averse behavior in hybrid foraging. That is, people display a preference for certainty and actively avoid taking risks. While altering the prevalence or reward value of the risky targets does influence people’s aversion to risk, the overall effect of risk remains dominant. Additionally, simulation results suggest that the observed risk-averse strategy is suboptimal in the sense that it prevents foragers from maximizing their overall returns.

Efficient metacognition is essential to many aspects of daily life, from health care to finance and education. Across three experiments, we found a specific form of curiosity in humans about the quality of their own metacognition, using a novel approach that dissociates perceptual from metacognitive information searches. Observers displayed a strategic balance in their curiosity, alternating between a focus on perceptual accuracy and metacognitive performance. Depending on the context, this metacognitive curiosity was modulated by an internal evaluation of metacognition, leading to increased feedback requests when metacognition was likely to be inaccurate. Using an ideal observer model, we describe how this curiosity trade-off can arise naturally from a recursive evaluation and transformation of decisions’ evidence. These results show that individuals are inherently curious about their metacognitive abilities and can compare perceptual and metacognitive precision to fine-tune performance monitoring. We propose that this form of curiosity may reflect humans’ drive to refine their self-model. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

Construal level theory (CLT) suggests that people do because our mental representation of events is moderated by how near or distant such events are in time. According to CLT, in the domain of risk preferences, psychological distance causes payoffs and probabilities to be differentially weighted or attended between present and future timepoints: Temporal distance increases the influence of payoffs and decreases the influence of probabilities. Specifically, CLT predicts that high probability/low amount lotteries (i.e., %-lotteries) are preferred in the present, whereas low probability/high amount lotteries (i.e., $- lotteries) are preferred in the future, even when the expected value of these lotteries is identical. We present a functional characterization and systematic investigation of this putative pattern of risk preferences and develop a formal model that incorporates CLT’s predictions. In five experiments, we examined several factors that could moderate the effect (e.g., outcome and probability magnitude, lottery presentation format, incentivization procedures). Both our behavioral observations and modeling results suggest the effect is labile, and if it does occur, it is not fully consistent with our formal model of CLT. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We test the hypothesis that individuals with stronger theory of mind skills and motivation garner more positive first impressions because of how they interact with others. Participants included 334 young adults who were paired with a peer for a first-time meeting. Dyads completed a cooperative Legobuilding task, which was videotaped and later coded for behavioral manifestations of theory of mind by independent raters. Theory of mind accuracy and motivation were assessed with validated laboratory tasks and a self-report questionnaire, respectively. First impressions were assessed based on partner’s ratings of participant likeability, enjoyment of the interaction, and changes in positive affect. Results of actor–partner interdependence mediation models revealed that the associations between theory of mind and first impressions are indirect and mediated through behaviors. Specifically, participants with stronger theory of mind demonstrated greater cognitive sensitivity and pragmatic conversational skills. However, only cognitive sensitivity subsequently predicted more favorable first impressions.

It can enhance the salience of new events in an ongoing background and helps maintain perceptual constancy in the face of variable sensory input. Several contrastive adaptation effects have been identified using sounds within the categories of human voice and musical instruments. The present study investigated whether such contrast effects can occur between voice and nonvoice stimulus categories. A 10-step continuum between “voice” (/a/, /o/, or /u/ vowels) and “instrument” (bassoon, horn, or viola) sounds was generated for each of the nine possible pairs. In each trial, an adaptor, either a voice or instrument, was played four times and was followed by a target from along the appropriate continuum. When trials with voice and instrumental adaptors were grouped into separate blocks, strong contrastive adaptation effects were observed, with the target more likely to be identified as a voice following instrumental adaptors and vice versa (Experiment 1). The effects were not observed for visual image adaptors (Experiment 2). The effects were somewhat larger when the adaptors and the target were presented to the same than to different ears, but significant adaptation was observed in both conditions, suggesting contributions of central mechanisms, following binaural integration (Experiment 3). The effect accumulated when the same type of adaptor was presented consecutively and persisted following the end of the adaptors (Experiment 4). The discovery of voice-nonvoice contrastive pairs opens the possibility of studying perceptual or neuronal voice selectivity while keeping acoustic features constant. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Despite age-related neurocognitive changes that could affect action words, and a rapidly aging population, the impact of healthy aging on action-word processing is poorly understood. Previous research suggests that in lexical tasks demanding semantic access, such as picture naming, higher motor-relatedness can enhance performance (e.g., fork vs. pier)—particularly in older adults, perhaps due to the age-related relative sparing of motor-semantic circuitry, which can support action words. However, motor-relatedness was recently found to affect performance in younger but not older adults in lexical decision. We hypothesized this was due to decreased semantic access in this task, especially in older adults. Here we tested effects of motor-relatedness on 2,174 words in younger and older adults not only in lexical decision but also in reading aloud, in which semantic access is minimal. Mixed-effects regression, controlling for phonological, lexical, and semantic variables, yielded results consistent with our predictions. In lexical decision, younger adults were faster and more accurate at words with higher-motor relatedness, whereas older adults showed no motor-relatedness effects. In reading aloud, neither age group showed such effects. Multiple sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the patternswere robust. Altogether, whereas previous research indicates that in lexical tasks demanding semantic access, higher motor-relatedness can enhance performance, especially in older adults, evidence nowsuggests that such effects are attenuatedwith decreased semantic access,which in turn depends on the task as well as aging itself. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

This, in turn, often depends on each party’s bargaining power, which varies with each party’s stakes in the potential agreement and available alternatives in case of disagreement. If there is an asymmetry, with one party enjoying higher bargaining power than another, this party can usually get a better deal, as often happens in real negotiations. A strong test of contractualist accounts of morality, then, is whether moral judgments do take bargaining power into account. We explore this in five preregistered experiments (n = 3,025; U.S.-based Prolific participants). We construct scenarios depicting everyday social interactions between two parties in which one of them can perform a mutually beneficial but unpleasant action. We find that the same actions (asking the other to perform the unpleasant action or explicitly refusing to do it) are perceived as less morally appropriate when performed by the party with lower bargaining power, as compared to the party with higher bargaining power. In other words, participants tend to give more moral leeway to parties with better bargaining positions and to hold disadvantaged parties to stricter moral standards. This effect appears to depend only on the relative bargaining power of each party but not on the magnitude of the bargaining power asymmetry between them. We discuss implications for contractualist theories of moral cognition and the emergence and persistence of unfair norms and inequality. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

In this article, we show that different elicitation methods elicit different belief distributions. We compare two popular methods used to elicit belief distributions: Distribution Builder and Sliders. In 10 preregistered studies (N = 14,553), we find that Distribution Builder elicits more accurate belief distributions than Sliders, except when true distributions are right-skewed, for which the results are mixed. This result holds when we assess accuracy (a) relative to a normative benchmark and (b) relative to participants’ own beliefs. Our evidence suggests that participants approach these two methods differently: Sliders users are more likely to start with the lowest bins in the interface, which in turn leads them to put excessive mass in those bins. Our research sheds light on the process by which people construct belief distributions while offering a practical recommendation for future research: All else equal, Distribution Builder yields more accurate belief distributions. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

For example, do comprehenders routinely make predictions about which words (and phonological forms) might come next in a conversation, or do they simply make broad predictions about the gist of the unfolding context? Prior EEG studies using tightly controlled experimental designs have shown that form-based prediction can occur during comprehension, as N400s to unexpected words are reduced when they resemble the form of a predicted word (e.g., ceke when expecting cake). One limitation, however, is that these studies often create environments that are optimal for eliciting form-based prediction (e.g., highly constraining sentences, slower-than-natural rates of presentation). Thus, questions remain about whether form-based prediction can occur in settings that more closely resemble everyday comprehension. To address this, the present study explores form-based prediction during naturalistic spoken language comprehension. English-speaking adults listened to a story in which some of the words had been altered. Specifically, we experimentally manipulated whether participants heard the original word from the story (cake), a form-similar nonword (ceke), or a less-similar nonword (vake). Half of the target words were predictable given their context, and the other half were unpredictable. Consistent with the prior work, we found reduced N400s for form-similar nonwords (ceke) relative to less-similar nonwords (vake)––but only in predictable contexts. This study demonstrates that form-based prediction can emerge in naturalistic contexts, and therefore, it is likely to be a common aspect of language comprehension in the wild. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Our previous work revealed that while SMS with visual flashing patterns was less consistent than with auditory or tactile patterns, it was still evident in a sample of nonmusicians. Although previous studies have speculated the potential role of auditory imagery, its contribution to visual SMS performance is not well quantified. Utilizing a synchronization–continuation finger-tapping task with a visual stimulus that included implied motion, we aimed to examine how participants’ imagery ability, musicality, and rhythm perception affected SMS performance.We quantified participants’ SMS consistency in synchronization (with visual cues) and continuation (without visual cues) phases. Participants also performed a perception task assessing their ability to detect temporal perturbations in the visual rhythm and completed musical ability and imagery questionnaires. Our linear regression model forSMS consistency included the trial phase, self-reported auditory imagery control and musicality, and visual rhythm perception as predictors. Significant effects of trial phase and auditory imagery scores on SMS consistency suggested that participants performed SMS more consistently while the guiding visual stimulus was present and that the higher one’s self-reported auditory imagery ability, the better their SMS when continuing with unguided rhythm. One’s visual rhythm perception accuracy significantly correlated with SMS consistency during the synchronization phase, and there was no correlation between rhythm perception and auditory imagery control.

A growing body of research has identified a core set of neural processes involved in explicit, episodic counterfactual thinking. Little is known, however, about the processes supporting the spontaneous, possibly implicit representation of alternatives. To make progress on this question, we induced participants to spontaneously generate counterfactual alternatives by asking them to judge whether agents were forced to make a particular choice or chose freely—a judgment that implicitly depends on their alternative options. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found 14 clusters that were preferentially engaged when participants were making force judgments (which elicit the spontaneous consideration of alternatives) compared to judgments of what actually occurred (which do not elicit alternatives). These clusters were widely distributed throughout the brain, including in the bilateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral inferior parietal lobule, bilateral middle and inferior temporal gyri, bilateral posterior cingulate, and bilateral caudate.

Although many tasks encounter a capacity limit of processing four visual objects at once, some evidence suggests far lower limits for processing relationships among objects. What is our capacity limit for relational processing? If it is indeed limited, then people may miss important relationships between data values in a graph. To test this question, we asked people to explore graphs of trivially simple 2 × 2 data sets and found that half of the viewers missed surprising and improbable relationships (e.g., a child’s height decreasing over time). These relationships were spotted easily in a control condition, which implicitly directed viewers to prioritize inspecting the key relationships. Thus, a severe limit on relational processing, combined with a cascade of other capacity-limited operations (e.g., linking values to semantic content), makes understanding a graph more like slowly reading a paragraph then immediately recognizing an image. These results also highlight the practical importance of “data storytelling” techniques, where communicators design graphs that help their audience prioritize the most important relationships in data. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We tested this hypothesized dissociation by masking, outside of a visible window, either the spaces between the words (to assess the perceptual span, Experiment 1) or the letters within the words (to assess the word identification span, Experiment 2). We also investigated whether deaf readers' previously reported larger reading span was specifically linked to one of these spans. We analyzed reading rate to test overall reading efficiency, as well as average saccade length to test ""where"" decisions and average fixation duration to test ""when"" decisions. Both hearing and deaf readers' perceptual spans extended between 10 and 14 characters, and their word identification spans extended to eight characters to the right of fixation. Despite similar sized rightward spans, deaf readers read more efficiently overall and showed a larger increase in reading rate when leftward text was available, suggesting they attend more to leftward information. Neither rightward span was specifically related to where or when decisions for either group. Our results challenge the assumed dissociation between type of reading span and type of saccade decision and indicate that reading efficiency requires access to both perceptual and linguistic information in the parafovea.

A number of computational models have been proposed that integrate confidence into sequential sampling models of decision making, in which evidence accumulates across time to a threshold. An influential example of this approach is the relative balance of evidence hypothesis, in which confidence is determined by the amount of evidence for the choice that was made compared to the evidence for all possible choices. Here, we modify this approach by mapping distance from a decision threshold to confidence via a sigmoid function. This allows for individual differences in bias toward lower or higher levels of confidence, as well as sensitivity to differences in evidence between choices. We apply several variants of the model to assess potential age differences between young and older adults in source memory decision making in an existing data set (Dodson, Bawa, & Slotnick, 2007).We compare our model to the relative balance of evidence approach, and the results indicate that the sigmoidal method substantially improves model fit. We also consider models in which memory errors can arise from a misrecollection process that involves associating items with the incorrect source, a process that has been proposed to account for age differences in source memory confidence and accuracy, but find no evidence that misrecollection is necessary to account for the results. This work provides a viable model of subjective confidence that is integrated with well-established models of decision making and provides insights into effects of aging on source memory decisions. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The present study investigated whether the likelihood of experiencing an attentional lapse depends on (a) the importance of the material being studied and (b) the learner’s age. In two experiments, younger and older adults completed a delayed free recall task in which to-be-remembered words were paired with point values. Thought probes were embedded into the encoding phase of each list to provide an index of one’s ability to maintain attention on task and prevent recurrent lapses of attention (i.e., the consistency of attention). Experiment 1 revealed all individuals better remembered high-value information at the expense of low-value information, and older adults were more frequently focused on the task than younger adults. Participants were also less likely to remember an item at test if they experienced an attentional lapse while learning said item, and they were more consistently focused on the task when studying high-value information than when studying low-value information. Age did not moderate either of these effects. Experiment 2 replicated the findings from Experiment 1 and further revealed that the positive association between age and attentional consistency was explained by age-related differences in affect, motivation, personality, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptomology. Once these factors were accounted for, older age was associated with increased attentional inconsistency (less on-task focus). While future replication of this finding is needed, implications for education and theories of both mind-wandering and aging are discussed. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, with few exceptions, contemporary developmental scientists have studied language input and language learning through the lens of the primary caregiver and the nuclear family, rather than the infants’ broader communities. In many communities—and increasingly in the United States—nonnuclear family structures are common, and extended kin, fictive kin, and intergenerational relationships are relied upon for child care. Understanding children’s relationships within kinship networks can allow for more inclusive depictions of children’s social interactions and their language experiences. We drew upon methods used by researchers studying social networks to assess U.S. infants’ and toddlers’ network composition. Results showed that young children with a greater number of close relationships (but not those with larger networks overall) had larger vocabularies, after controlling for age and socioeconomic status. These findings suggest that distributed models of child-rearing are an influential factor in early language growth and call for increased attention to social networks for understanding children’s developmental trajectories. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

An increasingly popular view holds that the key to avoiding distractions lies in suppressing the attentional priority of a salient distractor. However, the precise mechanisms of distractor suppression remain elusive. Because the computation of attentional priority is a time-dependent process, distractor suppression must be understood within these temporal dynamics. In four experiments, we tracked the temporal dynamics of visual attention using a novel forced-response method, by which participants were required to express their latent attentional priority at varying processing times via saccades. We show that attention could be biased either toward or away from a salient distractor depending on the timing of observation, with these temporal dynamics varying substantially across experiments. These dynamics were explained by a computational model assuming the distractor and target priority signals arrive asynchronously in time and with different influences on saccadic behavior. The model suggests that distractor signal suppression can be achieved via a “slow” mechanism in which the distractor priority signal dictates saccadic behavior until a late-arriving priority signal overrides it, or a “fast” mechanism which directly suppresses the distractor priority signal’s behavioral expression. The two mechanisms are temporally dissociable and can work collaboratively, resulting in time-dependent patterns of attentional allocation. The current work underscores the importance of considering the temporal dynamics of visual attention and provides a computational architecture for understanding the mechanisms of distractor suppression. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

A number of studies have examined the human perception of topology—in particular, whether adults and young children perceive and differentiate objects based on features like closure, boundedness, and emptiness. Topology is about more than “wholes and holes,” however; it also offers an efficient language for representing network structure. Topological maps, common for subway systems across the world, are an example of how effective this language can be. Inspired by this idea, here we examine “intuitive network topology.” We first show that people readily differentiate objects based on several different features of topological networks. We then show that people both remember and match objects in accordance with their topology, over and above substantial variation in their surface features. These results demonstrate that humans possess an intuitive understanding for the basic topological features of networks, and hint at the possibility that topology may serve as a format for representing relations in the mind. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We used a prototype approach to understand how loyalty is represented in Colombia and the United States and how these representations mediate attributions of loyalty and moral judgments of loyalty violations. Across seven studies (N = 1,984), we found cross-cultural similarities in the associative meaning of loyalty (Study 1) but found differences in the centrality of features associated with loyalty (Study 2) and the latent structure of loyalty representations (Study 3). Colombians represent loyalty in terms of more general moral characteristics, while U.S. participants represent loyalty in terms of interpersonal commitment, both in contrast with current approaches to loyalty. By comparing representations of loyalty and honesty, we establish that differences in loyalty conceptualizations reflect a different way of thinking about loyalty rather than morality more generally (Study 4). Further, Colombians attributed greater loyalty to individuals with general moral characteristics compared to participants from the U.S. sample (Study 5) and were more likely to classify nonloyal values as loyalty-related (Study 6). While the centrality of prototypical features predicts categorizing norm violations as loyalty-related, differences in prototypical structure account for differences in the severity of moral judgment for such violations (Study 7), which suggests that loyalty representations have similar functions, even though these representations differ in structural characteristics. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

Despite its potential to explain cognitive control variability, the supporting evidence for this model remains inconclusive. Prior studies frequently employed the Stroop task to assess this model, manipulating the proportion congruency (PC) at the list-wide and/or item-specific levels to target proactive and reactive control, respectively. However, these manipulations have been questioned as they may invoke low-level associative learning instead of control-driven mechanisms. Although solutions have been proposed to address these concerns, they still have limitations and impracticalities. In pursuit of a clearer understanding of this issue, we manipulated proactive and reactive control simultaneously to more directly investigate their separability. We conducted two experiments using a peripheral and a perifoveal spatial Stroop task version, respectively, and we adopted state-of-theart methodologies, leveraging trial-level multilevel modeling analytical approaches, to effectively estimate the Stroop effect and its control-related modulations while controlling for confounding factors. Notably, we manipulated both list-wide and item-specific PCs at the trial level, allowing for a fine-grained analysis. Our results provide compelling evidence for the existence of a list-wide, PC-dependent proactive control mechanism, influencing Stroop performance independently of reactive control and confounding factors. Additionally, an item-specific PC-dependent reactive control effect was found to influence Stroop performance only in interaction with proactive control. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between proactive and reactive control mechanisms, shedding light on the intricate nature of cognitive control. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Correlational studies conducted in virtual reality have shown that we feel more present when we are afraid, motivating claims that physiological changes contribute to presence; however, such causal claims remain to be evaluated. Here, we report two experiments that test the causal role of subjective and physiological components of fear (i.e., activation of the sympathetic nervous system) in generating presence. In Study 1, we validated a virtual reality simulation capable of inducing fear. Participants rated their emotions while they crossed a wooden plank that appeared to be suspended above a city street; at the same time, we recorded heart rate and skin conductance levels. Height exposure increased ratings of fear, presence, and both measures of sympathetic activation. Although presence and fear ratings were correlated during height exposure, presence and sympathetic activation were unrelated. In Study 2, we manipulated whether the plank appeared at height or at ground level. We also captured participants’ movements, which revealed that alongside increases in subjective fear, presence, and sympathetic activation, participants also moved more slowly at height relative to controls. Using a mediational approach, we found that the relationship between height exposure and presence on the plank was fully mediated by self-reported fear, and not by sympathetic activation. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

However, they prefer communication methods high in social richness (e.g., in-person interactions) when requesting money back from strong social connections such as close friends. Process evidence reveals the psychological dynamics at play: (a) people anticipate discomfort when requesting money back from distant acquaintances in person, driving them away from in-person requests and toward digital apps, and (b) people are more averse to appearing impersonal with close friends, driving them away from digital apps and toward in-person requests.

Prior research has shown that people imagine more positive than negative events in the personal future but more negative than positive events in the collective future. This interaction has been interpreted as a valence-based dissociation between collective and personal cognition. We examine if degrees of self-relatedness may account for these effects. In Study 1, participants (N = 299) imagined events in the future of their country and family, rated how central they viewed these collectives to their self and identity and rated the collectives’ futures for positive and negative valence. Positive and negative valence of the imagined collective futures was strongly associated with how central the collectives were viewed to the self. In Study 2, participants (N = 306) rated self-centrality, personal agency, and moral decline perceived for their country. All three measures explained independent variance in how positive the future was for their country. In Study 3, participants (N = 310) self-nominated collectives that they viewed as highly versus minimally central to their self and identity. The futures of highly central collectives were rated more positive than negative, whereas such positive bias was absent for the futures of minimally self-central collectives. Overall, the findings indicate that a continuum of different degrees of self-relatedness may explain the Valence × Domain interaction in previous work, and suggest a need to integrate research on collective future thinking with self-serving biases in social cognition. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In a Twitter (now called X) field experiment, we created bot accounts varying by partisanship and whether they identified as bots or humans. We randomly assigned Twitter users (N = 3,013) to be followed by one of these accounts. We found evidence for social motivation—users were much more likely to reciprocate links to copartisan relative to counter-partisan accounts when the accounts identified as humans versus bots. We also found evidence for both in-party preference and out-party dispreference—users were as likely to follow back copartisan accounts as they were unlikely to followback counter-partisan accounts, compared to politically neutral accounts.

Theoretical accounts of the testing effect generally suggest that the magnitude of the testing effect is dependent on retrieval practice performance, such that conditions that promote better retrieval practice performance should result in a greater testing effect. Empirical evidence, however, has been mixed. Although some studies showed a positive association between retrieval practice performance and the testing effect, others have shown either no relation or the reverse. In the present study, we experimentally manipulated retrieval practice performance using a retrieval-based response deadline manipulation and an encoding-based study trial manipulation. Across six experiments, the magnitude of the testing effect was independent of retrieval practice performance. However, when we aggregated the data across the experiments, participants with superior retrieval practice performance showed a greater testing effect—an individual difference. This dissociation between experimental and correlational outcomes suggests that the positive relation between retrieval practice performance and the testing effect is not causal, and indeed, simulation data showed that the correlation between retrieval practice performance and testing effect was an artifact.

As language signals—for example, words in a sentence—unfold, humans predict and activate likely upcoming input to facilitate comprehension. Prediction not only accelerates understanding but also prompts reassessment in the case of prediction error, fostering learning and refining comprehension skills. Therefore, it is paramount to understand what happens when linguistic predictions are violated—for example, when a sentence ends in an unpredicted word. One theory, which we test here, is that the originally predicted word is actively inhibited after semantic violations. Furthermore, we tested whether this purported lexical inhibition process is achieved by a domain-general mechanism—that is, one that also inhibits other processes (e.g., movement). We combined a semantic violation task, in which highly constrained sentences primed specific words but sometimes continued otherwise, with a motoric stop-signal task. Across two experiments, semantic violations significantly impaired simultaneous action-stopping. This implies that lexical and motor inhibition share the same process. In support of this view, multivariate decoding of electroencephalographic recordings showed early overlap in neural processing between action-stopping (motor inhibition) and semantic violations (lexical inhibition). Moreover, a known signature of motor inhibition (the stop-signal P3) was reduced after this initial overlap period, further suggesting the presence of a bottleneck due to shared processing. These findings show that semantic violations trigger inhibitory processing and suggest that this lexical inhibition recruits a domain-general inhibitory control mechanism. This provides a new perspective on long-standing debates in psycho-linguistics, extends the range of a well-characterized cognitive control mechanism into the linguistic domain, and offers support for recent neurobiological models of domain-general inhibitory control. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We present novel evidence from a retrospective survey, a diary study, and an experimental laboratory study indicating that people commonly experience simulations of the approximal future, and that simulations of the approximal future can be reliably distinguished, in terms of their valence and function, from simulations of future events that are expected to occur in spatiotemporal contexts that are distinct from ongoing experience.

Understanding how systematic biases in number perception occur within a hierarchy of increasingly complex feature representations helps uncover the multistage processing underlying our visual number sense. Recent work demonstrated that reducing coherence of low-level visual attributes, such as color and orientation, systematically reduces perceived number. Here, we ask when in the visual processing hierarchy coherence affects numerosity perception and specifically whether the coherence effect is exclusive to low-level visual features or instead whether it can be driven by contextual or semantic relationships. We tested adults in an ordinal numerical comparison task with contextual coherence mathematically manipulated using a statistical model of visual object co-occurrence. Across several experiments, we found that arrays with high contextual coherence were perceived as numerically larger than arrays with low contextual coherence. This contextual coherence effect was not attenuated even when we reduced objects to texforms (unrecognizable images that preserve midlevel visual features) or removed semantic content from the images through box scrambling and diffeomorphic warping. Together, these results suggest that visual coherence derived from natural statistics of object co-occurrence systematically alters perceived numerosity at low-level visual processing, even before later stages at which items can be explicitly categorized and identified. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

However, recent research has offered two important nuances: a potentially inadvertent impact of such games on people’s evaluation of non-misinformation (“real news”) and exponential decay over time if no memory-strengthening exercise is provided. We address these issues in two preregistered lab experiments (N1 = 191, N2 = 321) and four quasi-experimental in-game surveys implemented in Harmony Square (N3 = 559) and Bad News (N4 = 2,558, N5 = 419, N6 = 882). In Experiments 1 and 2, we test if providing different types of feedback after playing Bad News enhances discriminative ability of misinformation and real news 1 week postgameplay and find that doing so resulted in homogeneously better accuracy at identifying both misinformation and non-misinformation compared with a control condition, which played Bad News without feedback. In Experiments 3–6, we implemented two different types of feedback exercises in the Harmony Square and Bad News games and find that this significantly boosts discernment compared with playing the game without a feedback exercise, primarily by improving accuracy at detecting real news. We confirm these results using signal detection theory. We conclude that feedback exercises boost the effectiveness of gamified misinformation interventions, likely due to an improved learning environment. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

Even though people view prosocial lies as ethical, they believe it is more important—and more moral—to avoid harmful lies than to allow prosocial lies. Unconditional honesty (simply telling the truth, without finding out how honesty will affect others) is therefore seen as ethical because it prevents the most unethical actions (i.e., harmful lies) from occurring, even though it does not optimize every moral decision. We test this theory across five focal experiments and 10 supplemental studies. Consistent with our account, we find that communicators who tell the truth without finding out how honesty will affect others are viewed as more ethical, and are trusted more, than communicators who look for information about the social consequences of honesty before communicating. However, the moral preference for unconditional honesty attenuates when it is certain that looking for more information will not lead to harmful lies. Overall, this research provides a holistic understanding of how people think about honesty and suggests that moral rules are not valued because people believe all rule violations are wrong, but rather, because they believe some violations must be avoided entirely. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, little is known about how these behaviors are implemented when the trajectory of the moving target introduces variability and ambiguity into the perceptual–motor system. We developed a simple visuomotor task in which participants used a joystick to interact with a computer-controlled dot that moved along two-dimensional trajectories. This virtual system allowed us to define the role of the moving object (predator or prey) and adjust its speed and directional uncertainty (i.e., magnitude and frequency of random directional changes) during chase and escape trials. These factors had a significant impact on participants’ performance in both chasing and escaping trials. We developed a simple geometrical model of potential chaser/escaper interactions to distinguish pursuit from interception chasing trajectories. We found that participants initially pursued the target but switched to a late interception strategy. The amount of late interception strategy followed an inverted U-shaped curve with the highest values at intermediate speeds. We tested the applicability of our task and methods in children who showed a robust developmental improvement in task performance and late interception strategy. Our task constitutes a flexible system in a virtual space for studying chasing and escaping behavior in adults and children. Our analytical methods allow detecting subtle changes in interception strategies, a valuable tool for studying the maturation of predictive and prospective systems, with a high potential to contribute to cognitive and developmental research. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Empirical findings supporting both accounts were reported, yet some of them have been recently revisited based on failures to replicate. Here, we aimed at replicating a remarkable finding reported by Ric and Muller (2012); participants were able to follow an unseen instruction, integrate it with a subsequently presented pair of unseen digits, and accordingly either add the digits (resulting in a priming effect), or simply represent them. This finding thus demonstrates unconscious task-switching, temporal integration (involving mental chaining), and arithmetic operation. Finding such high-level processes in the absence of awareness is of pivotal importance to our understanding of consciousness, as it challenges prominent theories in the field (e.g., the global neuronal workspace). Accordingly, in light of the self-correction wave in psychological science in general and in the field of consciousness studies in particular, we report here a preregistered replication aimed at testing the reproducibility of this finding, while also better controlling for subjects’ awareness of both the instruction and the digits. Across two highly powered experiments, our results failed to replicate the original effect. We, therefore, conclude that the current evidence does not support the claim that arithmetic operations (specifically, addition) can be flexibly initiated without awareness, in line with the current arguments for a more limited scope of unconscious processing. © (2024), (American Psychological Association).

We examined how people manage such decision conflicts in five preregistered experiments (N = 900) that confronted participants with two public goods that varied in efficiency and (in)equality of returns. People cooperated more on the comparatively efficient public good and on the equal-return (vs. unequal-return) public good (Experiment 1), yet when the unequal-returns public good was also the most efficient, individuals cooperated comparatively more on this unequal-but-efficient public good when they themselves benefitted the most from inequality (Experiments 2–4). Low beneficiaries largely ignored public goods efficiency and preferentially cooperated on the equal- rather than unequal-returns public good. Expectations (Experiments 2–4), preferences for revising the multiple-public-goods provision problems’ choice architecture (Experiments 3–4), and descriptive norms held by uninvolved arbitrators (Experiment 5) echoed these cooperation patterns, but uninvolved arbitrators deemed it socially appropriate to cooperate more on the equal than the unequal public good regardless of beneficiary position.

How then should individuals make causal inferences from measurements over time? Across three experiments, we had participants observe experimental and control groups over several days posttreatment in a fictional biological research setting. We identify competing perspectives in the literature: contingency-driven accounts predict no effect of the outcome timing while the contiguity principle suggests people will view a treatment as more harmful to the extent that bad treatment outcomes occur earlier rather than later. In contrast, inference of the functional form of a treatment effect can license extrapolation beyond the measurements and lead to different causal inferences. We find participants’ causal strength and direction judgments in temporal settings vary with minimal manipulations of instruction framing. When it is implied that the observations are made over a preplanned number of days, causal judgments depend strongly on contiguity. When it is implied that the observation may be ongoing, participants extrapolate current trends into the future and adapt their causal judgments accordingly. When data are revealed sequentially, participants rely on extrapolation regardless of instruction framing.

A difficulty with using power for this purpose is that the classical power formula does not incorporate sources of uncertainty (e.g., sampling variability) that can impact the computed power value, leading to a false sense of precision and confidence in design choices. We use simulations to demonstrate the consequences of adding two common sources of uncertainty to the calculation of power. Sampling variability in the estimated effect size (Cohen’s d) can introduce a large amount of uncertainty (e.g., sometimes producing rather flat distributions) in power and sample-size determination. The addition of random fluctuations in the population effect size can cause values of its estimates to take on a sign opposite the population value, making calculated power values meaningless. These results suggest that calculated power values or use of such values to justify sample size add little to planning a study.

Incidental suppression is a result of a competition induced by interfering items or responses. In contrast, intentional suppression is said to result from conscious attempts to suppress certain memory items, and should thus not depend on competition induced by interfering items or responses. However, intentional suppression is typically engendered using the Think/No-Think paradigm, in which participants are required to retrieve some target items and to suppress others. Therefore, rather than intentional suppression, forgetting in this paradigm may reflect incidental suppression of No-Think items induced by interference via prior retrieval of the Think items. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested participants (n = 40) using an adjusted suppression paradigm, which did not include the Think condition (ExcludeThink paradigm) and compared it with the standard suppression paradigm (IncludeThink paradigm; n = 39) which included a think condition. We found that suppression was not observed in the ExcludeThink paradigm, but only in the IncludeThink paradigm.

Because letter-sound coupling is crucial in reading, we investigated the engagement of the lvOT cortex in processing phonology (i.e., the sound patterns of words) as a function of reading acquisition. We tested 47 Polish children both at the beginning of formal literacy instruction and 2 years later. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, children performed auditory phonological tasks from small to large grain size levels (i.e., single phoneme, rhyme). We showed that orthographically relevant lvOT areas activated during small-grain size phonological tasks were skill-dependent, perhaps due to the relatively transparent mappings between orthography and phonology in Polish. We also studied activation pattern similarity between processing visual and auditory word stimuli in the lvOT. We found that a higher similarity level was observed in the anterior lvOT compared to the posterior lvOT after 2 years of schooling. This is consistent with models proposing a posterior-to-anterior shift in word processing during reading acquisition. We argue that the development of orthography-phonology coupling at the brain level reflects writing system-specific effects and a more universal pathway of the left vOT development in reading acquisition. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, it is still rigorously debated why such correlations occur. Some theories posit a single ability (e.g., attention control, short-term memory capacity, controlled memory search) as the primary reason behind WMC’s predictiveness, whereas others argue that WMC is predictive because it taps into multiple abilities. Here, we tested these single- and multifaceted accounts of WMC with a large-scale (N = 974) individual-differences investigation of WMC and three hypothesized mediators: attention control, primary memory, and secondary memory. We found evidence for a multifaceted account, such that no single ability could fully mediate the relation between WMC and higher order cognition (i.e., reading comprehension and fluid intelligence).

A secondary goal was to determine if the ages and content of actual memories recounted by older adults aligned closely with people’s expectations for memories provided by an imaginary “typical” older adult. In Study 1, college students were asked to estimate the ages at which people are most likely to have committed crimes and minor moral transgressions; estimated ages peaked sharply during adolescence and early adulthood. Participants also listed emotions that they thought would accompany these misdeeds. In Study 2, college students were asked to describe memories that they expected a typical older adult to recall in response to distinctive emotion cues, including the negative emotions identified in Study 1. Study 3 was a replication of Study 2 using middle-aged participants. In Study 4, older adults provided their own personal memories in response to the emotion cues used in Study 2 and Study 3.

We first validated the conditions in an online sample (N= 201; Study 1) and in a lab environment (N=72; Study 2). In the primary app-based experiment, participants (N= 3,277; Study 3) completed 3 days of baseline assessments that included three check-ins each day inwhichwe obtained heart rate and blood pressure responses using an optic sensor and assessed current stress and emotions. Participants were then randomly assigned to either the paced breathing or hand closure condition for the next 6 days.

Moreover, the increase in positive emotions and perceived coping was not evident among a comparison sample (N= 2,600) who completed check-ins but did not participate in either of the paced breathing or sham-control conditions. However, their blood pressure declined over time, suggesting that the continual monitoring of one’s blood pressure may result in detectable decreases. Our results highlight the importance of designing experiments with appropriately matched control conditions and suggest that changes associated with techniques like paced breathing, in part, may stem from positive incidental features of the technique. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The present research investigated language-based preferences in 4- to 8-year-old children living in Hyderabad, India, a multilingual region with languages such as Telugu (official language of the state, and the native language of many children in the state) and English (medium of instruction in some schools). We presented to children novel objects and probed their selective preference to learn from different speakers (Telugu, British-accented English, or Indianaccented English). In addition, the current study assessed the flexibility of children’s preferences by manipulating the learning goal (i.e., performance goal vs. enjoyment goal) and learning content (i.e., Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics [STEM] objects vs. cultural objects). Children showed a preference for both English speakers over Telugu speakers, a tendency that increased with age. This preference was especially pronounced for performance learning goals and for STEM learning content. Furthermore, children whose native language was Telugu showed a less pronounced English bias. The results of this study provide new insights into the development of language-based biases in multilingual environments. First, they highlight dual and intersecting considerations of speaker familiarity and speaker status in guiding children’s choices about from whom to learn. Second, the results suggest that children’s language-based preferences in a pedagogical setting are flexible, as children integrate social cues (e.g., language-based attitudes) as well as contextual cues (e.g., the learning goal) strategically. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

But these studies are generally conducted in fairly static experimental contexts. Might spatiotopic object-location binding only emerge in more dynamic saccade contexts? In the present study, we inves-tigated this using the spatial congruency bias paradigm in healthy adults. In the static (single-saccade) context, we found purely retinotopic binding, as before. However, robust spatiotopic binding emerged in the dynamic saccade context (multiple frequent saccades and saccades during stimulus presentation). We further isolated specific factors that modulate retinotopic and spatiotopic binding. Our results provide strong evidence that dynamic saccade context can trigger more stable object-location binding in ecologically relevant spatiotopic coordinates, perhaps via a more flexible brain state that accommodates improved visual stability in the dynamic world. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Rwanda provides a unique example of how two groups must reconcile and manage their intergroup biases following a genocidal process. In this study, we employed a novel intended behavior task to measure intergroup prosociality among former genocide perpetrators, genocide survivors, and their children in Rwanda. Participants were required to choose between various individuals representing their own in-group or their out-group as recipients of their prosocial intentions.We measured how frequently they selected in-group or out-group individuals and to what extent choosing each individual induced cognitive conflict, as measured by reaction times (RTs) and midfrontal theta (FMθ) activity. The results indicated that survivors and their children selected former perpetrators and their offspring less frequently. Furthermore, selecting them involved a higher cognitive conflict, as evidenced by longer RT and a higher FMθ, compared to choosing their own in-group. For the group composed of former perpetrators and their children, we observed a dissociation. They selected out-group individuals more frequently, perhaps as a compensatory behavior for their past wrongdoings. Nonetheless, selecting the out-group individuals involved a higher cognitive conflict than selecting their own in-group. Importantly, we observed a similar intergroup prosociality bias in the children of both survivors and former perpetrators, mirroring that of their parents.

To compare the lexical and semantic access to number representations between two languages, we recruited a sample of balanced highly proficient German–French adult bilinguals. At school, those bilinguals learned mathematics in German for 6 years (LM1) and then switched to French (LM2) in 7th grade (12 years old) until 13th grade. After the brief presentation of primes (51 ms) consisting of Indo-Arabic digits or number words in German or French, an Indo-Arabic digits target had to be read in either German or French in an online study. Stimuli were numbers from 1 to 9, and we varied the absolute distance between primes and targets from 0 (i.e., 1–1) to 3 (1–4; as in Reynvoet et al., 2002). The priming distance effect (PDE) was used to measure the strength of numerical semantic association. We find comparable PDEs with Indo-Arabic digits and German number word primes, independently from the target naming language. However, we did not find a clear PDE with French number word primes, neither when naming targets in German, nor in French. The weaker PDE from LM2 compared to LM1 primes is interpreted as a weaker lexico-semantic association of LM2 number words. These results indicate a critical role of the LM1 and further emphasize the role of language in processing numbers. They might have important implications for designing bilingual school curricula. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Due to the explicit template-based attentional control involved in feature search mode, singleton detection mode is often assumed to be less mentally effortful, which can potentially explain why people search using such an inefficient and distraction-prone strategy. However, this assumption remains largely untested. In the present study, we used a hand dynamometer to relate physical effort to perceived mental effort across different search conditions. Surprisingly, across three experiments, participants exerted more effort to avoid singleton detection trials compared to feature search trials, suggesting that they found singleton detection to be the more effortful mode of searching. In a fourth experiment, we removed the physical effort component and simply asked participants to self-report how effortful they perceived each search task to be. Participants robustly indicated that singleton detection trials were more effortful. Lastly, in a fifth experiment, we removed distractor-present trials. Again, participants exerted more effort to avoid singleton detection trials. In contrast to widely held assumptions, our findings suggest that searching for a salient singleton is in fact more mentally effortful than searching for a specific feature in a heterogeneous display, which has broad implications for theories of attentional control and the influence of mental effort on cognition. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Instead, what is often manipulated are the distal (and arbitrarily associated) consequences of our actions. The few studies that did investigate whether tactile information contributes to the experience of agency have been limited to the binary assessment of tactile feedback about the outcome of an action being present or absent. Here, we went beyond the coarse comparison of agency with versus without tactile feedback and introduced instead an experimental manipulation where we could control the amount of mismatch between predictions and observations. Participants (N = 40) reached with their right hand toward a ridged plate with a specific orientation and saw online feedback that could match or differ from their action in one of three ways: the physical plate’s orientation, the action’s timing, or the hand’s position in space. Absolute subjective ratings revealed that an increased mismatch in tactile information led to a diminished sense of agency, similar to what has been reported for spatial and temporal mismatches. Further, estimations of metacognitive efficiency revealed similar Mratios in identifying visuo-tactile violation predictions as compared to visuotemporal violations (but lower than visuospatial). These findings emphasize the importance of tactile information in shaping our experience of acting voluntarily and show how this important component can be experimentally probed. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Despite its central role for informed electorates and political decision making, little is known about how aware people are of whether they are right or wrong when distinguishing accurate political information from falsehood. Here, we investigate people’s metacognitive insight into their own ability to detect political misinformation. We use data from a unique longitudinal study spanning 12 waves over 6 months that surveyed a representative U.S. sample (N = 1,191) on the most widely circulating political (mis)information online. Harnessing signal detection theory methods to model metacognition, we found that people from both the political left and the political right were aware of how well they distinguished accurate political information from falsehood across all news. However, this metacognitive insight was considerably lower for Republicans and conservatives—than for Democrats and liberals—when the information in question challenged their ideological commitments. That is, given their level of knowledge, Republicans’ and conservatives’ confidence was less likely to reflect the correctness of their truth judgments for true and false political statements that were at odds with their political views. These results reveal the intricate and systematic ways in which political preferences are linked to the accuracy with which people assess their own truth discernment. More broadly, by identifying a specific political asymmetry—for discordant relative to concordant news—our findings highlight the role of metacognition in perpetuating and exacerbating ideological divides. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

Satiation can play a role in regulating eating behavior, but research suggests visual cues may be just as important. In a seminal study by Wansink et al. (2005), researchers used self-refilling bowls to assess how visual cues of portion size would influence intake. The study found that participants who unknowingly ate from self-refilling bowls ate more soup than did participants eating from normal (not self-refilling) bowls. Despite consuming 73% more soup, however, participants in the self-refilling condition did not believe they had consumed more soup, nor did they perceive themselves as more satiated than did participants eating from normal bowls. Given recent concerns regarding the validity of research from the Wansink lab, we conducted a preregistered direct replication study of Wansink et al. (2005) with a more highly powered sample (N =464 vs. 54 in the original study). We found that most results replicated, albeit with half the effect size (d= 0.45 instead of 0.84), with participants in the self-refilling bowl condition eating significantly more soup than those in the control condition. Like the original study, participants in the selfrefilling condition did not believe they had consumed any more soup than participants in the control condition. These results suggest that eating can be strongly controlled by visual cues, which can even override satiation. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Such fluctuations are particularly prominent in reaction time (RT) series from laboratory neurocognitive tasks. Despite their omnipresent nature, trial-to-trial fluctuations remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically analyzed RT series from various neurocognitive tasks, quantifying how much of the total trial-to-trial RT variance can be explained with general linear models (GLMs) by three sources of variability that are frequently investigated in behavioral and neuroscientific research: (1) experimental conditions, employed to induce systematic patterns in variability, (2) short-term temporal dependencies such as the autocorrelation between subsequent trials, and (3) long-term temporal trends over experimental blocks and sessions. Furthermore, we examined to what extent the explained variances by these sources are shared or unique. We analyzed 1913 unique RT series from 30 different cognitive control and perception-based tasks. On average, the three sources together explained ∼8%–17% of the total variance. The experimental conditions explained on average ∼2.5%–3.5% but did not share explained variance with temporal dependencies. Thus, the largest part of the trial-to-trial fluctuations in RT remained unexplained by these three sources. Unexplained fluctuations may take on nonlinear forms that are not picked up by GLMs. They may also be partially attributable to observable endogenous factors, such as fluctuations in brain activity and bodily states. Still, some extent of randomness may be a feature of the neurobiological system rather than just nuisance. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Several computational models of confidence have been developed but not enough has been done to compare these models, making it difficult to adjudicate between them. Here, we compare 14 popular models of confidence that make various assumptions, such as confidence being derived from postdecisional evidence, from positive (decision-congruent) evidence, from posterior probability computations, or from a separate decision-making system for metacognitive judgments. We fit all models to three large experiments in which subjects completed a basic perceptual task with confidence ratings. In Experiments 1 and 2, the best-fitting model was the lognormal meta noise (LogN) model, which postulates that confidence is selectively corrupted by signal-dependent noise. However, in Experiment 3, the positive evidence (PE) model provided the best fits. We evaluated a new model combining the two consistently best-performing models—LogN and the weighted evidence and visibility (WEV). The resulting model, which we call logWEV, outperformed its individual counterparts and the PE model across all data sets, offering a better, more generalizable explanation for these data. Parameter and model recovery analyses showed mostly good recoverability but with important exceptions carrying implications for our ability to discriminate between models. Finally, we evaluated each model’s ability to explain different patterns in the data, which led to additional insight into their performances. These results comprehensively characterize the relative adequacy of current confidence models to fit data from basic perceptual tasks and highlight the most plausible mechanisms underlying confidence generation. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

To address these inconsistencies, we evaluated the ability to focus attention using a battery of 11 tasks in a large sample of younger and older adults (n = 172/174). We addressed whether (a) individual differences and aging effects are consistent across different attention tasks and (b) there is a domain-specific or domain-general age-related decline in focused attention. Both younger and older adults benefited from focusing attention on space, features, and memory representations. Confirmatory factor analysis showed substantial commonalities in baseline performance across all tasks, indicating shared variance in decision-making and memory processes. Focused-attention effects, however, formed separate factors reflecting spatial-, feature-, and memory-based attentional efficiency. Correlations between these factors were generally low and inconsistent for both age groups. This supports the view that focused attention is not a single ability. Within the same domain, some tasks showed a decline, whereas others showed improvement with aging, and, on average, attentional benefits were similar across age groups. Accordingly, our results are inconsistent with the claim that aging is associated with either domain-specific or domain-general decline in focused attention. © (2024), (American Psychological Association).

To do so, we measured children’s obligation judgments and unstructured descriptions of third-party intervention. Although some cultural differences emerged, 6-year-olds largely considered bystanders as obligated to respond to wrongdoing, regardless of the bystander’s social position. In contrast, 9- and 12-year-olds were more likely to exclusively ascribe this social responsibility to people in positions of authority. Despite these age differences, children of all ages generated role-specific descriptions of third-party intervention, with authority figures intervening in distinct ways from peers. For authority figures, children in India and Uganda described third-party intervention as involving corporal punishment or unspecified punishment, whereas children in the United States described such intervention as involving only verbal intervention (i.e., telling someone to stop). For peers, children in all societies described third-party intervention as involving reporting misdeeds to an authority.

Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS), we measured functional connectivity at 6 (n =147) and 24 (n = 111) months of age in infants from Bangladesh who were exposed to varying levels of environmental adversity (i.e., lowand middle-income cohorts). We employed a background functional connectivity approach that regresses out the effects of stimulus-specific univariate responses that are believed to affect functional connectivity. At 6 months, the two cohorts had similar fNIRS patterns, with moderate connectivity estimates for regions within and between hemispheres. At 24 months, the patterns diverged for the two cohorts. Global (brain-wide) connectivity estimates increased from 6 to 24 months for the low-income cohort and decreased for the middle-income (MI) cohort. In particular, connectivity estimates among regions of interest within the right hemisphere decreased for the MI cohort, providing evidence of neural specialization by 2 years of age.

We conducted six preregistered experiments (N = 1,306) to replicate and extend the findings from Eskreis-Winkler and Fishbach (2019) with novel tests of self-focused feedback, task expectations, and subsequent instruction. The detriments of failure feedback were replicated in Studies 1a, 1b, and 1c, which altered the focus of the feedback message to be self-focused (e.g., your answer) or task-focused (e.g., the answer). The detriments of failure feedback were also replicated in Study 2 when the task expectations were manipulated to easy versus hard. These results generally underscored the robustness of the results from the original study. However, Study 3 established boundary conditions. When it was a rule-based task and brief instructions on the rule were provided after feedback, there was no evidence of a detrimental effect of failure, and failure feedback, in some conditions, resulted in even better learning than success feedback for learning new material.

The similarities between direct hand interactions with objects (hand-based sensing) and the ability to extend sensory information processing beyond the hand (tool-mediated sensing) entail the existence of comparable processes for integrating tool- and hand-sensed information with vision, raising the question of whether tools support vision in bimanual object manipulations. Here, we investigated participants’ performance while grasping objects either held with a tool or with their hand and compared these conditions with visually guided grasping (Experiment 1). By measuring reaction time, peak velocity, and peak of grip aperture, we found that actions were initiated earlier and performed with a smaller peak grip aperture when the object was seen and held with the tool or the contralateral hand compared to when it was only seen. Thus, tool-mediated sensing effectively supports vision in multisensory grasping and, even more intriguingly, resembles hand-based sensing. We excluded that results were due to the force exerted on the tool’s handle (Experiment 2). Additionally, as for hand-based sensing, we found evidence that the tool supports vision by mainly providing object positional information (Experiment 3). Thus, integrating the tool-sensed position of the object with vision is sufficient to promote a multisensory advantage in grasping. Our findings indicate that multisensory integration mechanisms significantly improve grasping actions and fine-tune contralateral hand movements even when object information is only indirectly sensed through a tool. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

The current evidence in support of this claim, however, is limited. In order to investigate the presence of egocentric bias in adult belief processing, computer mouse tracking was used across three experiments to measure attraction toward response options reflecting one’s current knowledge while reporting a false belief. Participants viewed scenarios in which an agent either had a true belief or a false belief about the location of a set of keys. Participants used a mouse to answer reality questions “where are the keys currently hidden?” and belief questions “where does she think the keys are?” Mouse-tracking measures indexing attraction toward response options during decision making were measured, along with time taken to make a response and accuracy. Experiment 1 found no evidence, in any measures, that participants showed a bias toward their own knowledge when reporting another’s false belief. Experiment 2 investigated whether differences in event timings between true belief and false belief scenarios in Experiment 1 masked an egocentric bias. Experiment 3 investigated whether the lack of egocentric bias could be explained by participants prioritizing encoding the other’s beliefs. Neither follow- up experiment found evidence supporting the presence of an egocentric bias.

Three- to 6-year-olds from the United States (N = 138) and Turkey (N = 88) were randomly assigned to hear one of these stories over Zoom, before playing a game in which they searched for sea creatures across five fish tanks. All tanks had the same number of hiding spots but varied in the number of creatures they contained. Time was limited and children could not return to prior tanks, pushing them to allocate search effort strategically. Results indicated that across both countries, children in the strategic curiosity condition explored the virtual “aquarium” more broadly; they moved through tanks more rapidly than children in the control condition and were more likely to explore all five tanks before time ran out. Children in the strategic curiosity condition also showed relatively more strategic search, adapting their search based on the likelihood of finding creatures in each tank. While further research is needed to pinpoint which elements of our stories produced differences in search behavior and whether they did so by enhancing or inhibiting children’s strategic exploration, storybooks appear to be a promising method for shaping children’s exploration across multiple countries. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, successful learning involves recognizing when teaching is ineffective, even in the absence of overt cues, and divesting from ineffective teaching to explore novel solutions. Across three experiments, we investigated 7- to 10-year-old children’s ability to recognize ineffective teaching; we tested the hypothesis that girls may be less likely than boys to divest by exploring new solutions, given documented gender differences in socialization toward conformity and obedience. Overall, we demonstrate that children independently tested taught solutions and, upon learning that the solutions were ineffective, rationally traded off between instruction and exploration. Simultaneously, gender differences in divestment emerged. On average, girls demonstrated greater persistence in applying the taught solution, while boys tended to explore their own ideas, leading to differences in solving and learning. Importantly, these differences were observable across both masculine- and feminine-stereotyped tasks. These results have important implications for children’s learning and the development of leadership. © (2024), (American Psychological Association). All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

We provide evidence that abstract geometry reflects the geometry humans and nonhuman animals use for spatial navigation. Across two preregistered experiments, educated adults watched short videos of two points and two line segments forming an open figure on an otherwise blank screen. These simple visuals were described with sparse and minimally different language, creating different spatial contexts. After watching each video, participants were asked to click: anywhere (anywhere condition); to complete the triangle (triangle condition); where the next corner of the object would be (object condition); where the next stop on the agent’s path would be (navigation condition); or where the next point on the abstract surface would be (abstract condition). Across spatial contexts, participants produced responses that reflected strikingly different sets of geometric representations; in particular, preserving distance and direction for open paths in the navigation condition but preserving length and angle for closed shapes in the object condition. In the navigation and abstract contexts, however, the elicited geometry was remarkably similar. Human language may thus effectively isolate phylogenetically ancient geometric representations used for navigating the physical world and recognizing the objects in it. Moreover, the cognitive origins of uniquely human abstract geometry may lie in representations used for navigating the physical world. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

An account is used when some resources of that account have been used (e.g., $90 has been used on a gift card that originally had $100). An account is unused when no resources of that account have been used (e.g., no money has been used on a gift card that has $10). Across seven studies (N = 8,667), we find that people are more likely to spend resources from a used account than otherwise equivalent resources from an unused account. This is because people engage in within-account comparisons, comparing the remaining resources in the account with what the account originally had, leading them to value the remaining resources less in a used account. We demonstrate the robustness of the effect of a used (vs. unused) account across several domains, including gift cards, checking accounts, and credit card reward points. Further, we demonstrate a boundary condition of the effect, revealing that the proportion of the account remaining moderates the subsequent consumption. Lastly, we generalize this effect from consumption to charitable giving. The findings provide insights into how policymakers, companies, and individuals may consider leveraging the perception of an account being used or unused to curb expenses and encourage charitable giving. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

But humans also identify strongly with groups. Concerns about group-based reputation may similarly shape people’s psychology, perhaps especially in contexts where shifts in group reputation can have strategic consequences. Do individuals allow their concern with their group’s reputation to shape their reactions to even large-scale societal suffering versus benefits? Examining both affective responses and financially incentivized behavior of partisans in the United States, five preregistered experiments (N = 7,534) demonstrate that group-based reputational incentives can weaken—and sometimes nearly eliminate—affective differentiation between present-term societal harms and benefits. This can occur even when these societal harms and benefits are substantial—including economic devastation and national security threats—and when the consequences impact ingroup members. Individuals’ sensitivity to groupbased reputation can even cause them to divert resources from more effective to less effective charities. We provide evidence that partisans care about group-based reputation in part because it holds strategic value, positioning their group to improve its standing vis-a-vis the outgroup. By allowing group-based reputational incentives to reduce their sensitivity to societal outcomes, partisans may play into the other side’s cynical narratives about their disregard for human suffering, damaging bridges to cooperation. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The participants were presented with pairs of options, each associated with a math word problem of a certain difficulty level. We examined whether the participants’ preference for a more challenging (i.e., more difficult) option changes after observing the decisions of others who hold a challenge-seeking or a challenge-avoiding attitude. Five experiments consistently showed that, while the participants generally avoided challenging word problems, observing challenge-seeking in others increased the probability of participants choosing more challenging options.

However, it is unclear if this bundling effect extends to age diversity and the selection of older candidates, as older workers are often the target of socially acceptable negative stereotypes and bias in recruitment, leaving them unemployed for longer than their younger counterparts. Across five preregistered experiments (total N = 4,096), we tested if the positive effect of bundling on diversity of selections extends to older candidates in hiring decisions. We found evidence of bias against older job candidates in hiring decisions but found inconsistent effects of choice bundling on the selection of older candidates across experiments. An effect of bundling was found in two of five experiments, with no meta-analytic effect found across the five studies. Making older candidates more competitive and introducing a diversity statement aimed at increasing their selection both significantly increased older candidate selections, but failed to activate the bundling effect.

Perceptual deficit accounts attribute phonological dysfunction to lower-level deficits in speech-sound processing. However, a causal pathway from speech perception to phonological performance has not been established. We assessed this relationship in typical adults by experimentally disrupting speech-sound discrimination in a phonological short-term memory (pSTM) task.We used an automated audio-morphing method (Rogers & Davis, 2017) to create ambiguous intermediate syllables between 16 letter name–letter name (“B”–“P”) and letter name–word (“B”–“we”) pairs. High- and low-ambiguity syllables were used in a pSTM task in which participants (N = 36) recalled sixand eight-letter name sequences. Low-ambiguity sequences were better recalled than high-ambiguity sequences, for letter name–letter name but not letter name–word morphed syllables. A further experiment replicated this ambiguity cost (N= 26), but failed to show retroactive or prospective effects for mixed highand low-ambiguity sequences, in contrast to pSTM findings for speech-in-noise (SiN; Guang et al., 2020; Rabbitt, 1968). These experiments show that ambiguous speech sounds impair pSTM, via a different mechanism to SiN recall. We further show that the effect of ambiguous speech on recall is context-specific, limited, and does not transfer to recall of nonconfusable items. This indicates that speech perception deficits are not a plausible cause of pSTM difficulties in language disorders. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

While extensively studied, evidence in support of the universal law has relied on low-dimensional stimuli and small stimulus sets that are very different from their real-world counterparts. This is largely because pairwise comparisons—as required for similarity judgments—scale quadratically in the number of stimuli.We provide strong evidence for the universal law in a naturalistic high-dimensional regime by analyzing an existing data set of 214,200 human similarity judgments and a newly collected data set of 390,819 human generalization judgments (N = 2,406 U.S. participants) across three sets of natural images. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

One way to escape boredom and increase stimulation is to consume digital media, for example watching short videos on YouTube or TikTok. One common way that people watch these videos is to switch between videos and fast-forward through them, a form of viewing we call digital switching. Here, we hypothesize that people consume media this way to avoid boredom, but this behavior paradoxically intensifies boredom. Across seven experiments (total N = 1,223; six preregistered), we found a bidirectional, causal relationship between boredom and digital switching. When participants were bored, they switched (Study 1), and they believed that switching would help them avoid boredom (Study 2). Switching between videos (Study 3) and within video (Study 4), however, led not to less boredom but more boredom; it also reduced satisfaction, reduced attention, and lowered meaning. Even when participants had the freedom to watch videos of personal choice and interest on YouTube, digital switching still intensified boredom (Study 5). However, when examining digital switching with online articles and with nonuniversity samples, the findings were less conclusive (Study 6), potentially due to factors such as opportunity cost (Study 7). Overall, our findings suggest that attempts to avoid boredom through digital switching may sometimes inadvertently exacerbate it. When watching videos, enjoyment likely comes from immersing oneself in the videos rather than swiping through them. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Additionally, it is not clear whether ResMem and humans share access to overlapping properties of memorability. Here, in three experiments, we show that ResMem predicts stimulus-intrinsic memorability independent of stimulus-extrinsic factors, and that it captures aspects of memorability that are inaccessible to human observers.

Yet, it is unclear how exposure refines internal perceptual representations of faces to give rise to such behavioral effects. To address this issue, we investigated short- and long-term experienced stimulus history on face processing. Participants performed same–different judgments in a serial discrimination task where two consecutive faces were drawn from a distribution of morphed faces. The use of stimulus statistics was measured by testing the gravitation of representations toward the experienced mean (regression-to-the-mean), and the dynamic of the biases was tested by investigating trial-by-trial performance. Own-race and own-age faces were tested alongside other-race and other-age faces employing a within-subject design. Results demonstrated greater regression biases in other-race and other-age faces than in own-race and own-age faces. Perceptual narrowing, measured by the ability to form and use the representation of the overall mean of the nonnative faces, varied with proficiency levels, with only those with low proficiency in face recognition showing the use of overall stimulus history for other-race faces. In contrast, the use of stimulus history for other-age faces was similarly affected by statistics in the low- and high-proficiency groups. The results demonstrate that narrowing is associated with specialization levels occurring more robustly for other-race faces, for which exposure is limited during sensitive periods in development. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We provide a lifespan perspective on this confidence–accuracy relation, based on two previously published experiments with 320 participants, including children aged 6–13, young adults aged 18–27, and older adults aged 65–77, across tests of working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM). Participants studied visual items in arrays of varying set sizes and completed item recognition tests featuring 6-point confidence ratings either immediately after studying each array (WM tests) or following a long period of study events (LTM tests). Confidence–accuracy characteristic analyses showed that accuracy improved with increasing confidence for all age groups and in both WM and LTM tests. These findings reflect a universal ability across the lifespan to use awareness of the strengths and limitations of one’s memories to adjust reported confidence. Despite this age invariance in the confidence–accuracy relation, however, young children were more prone to high-confidence memory errors than other groups in tests of WM, whereas older adults were more susceptible to high-confidence false alarms in tests of LTM. Thus, although participants of all ages can assess when their memories are weaker or stronger, individuals with generally weaker memories are less adept at this confidence–accuracy calibration. Findings also speak to potential different sources of high-confidence memory errors for young children and older adults, relative to young adults. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Past work has shown that these diversity initiatives may not be as effective as expected and may instead result in unintended negative consequences for the very individuals they are meant to support. In three novel experiments (total N = 3,664), we investigated whether and when the presence of pro-diversity messages in organizational job recruitment materials might facilitate versus hinder the hiring of underrepresented racial minorities. Participant race and political ideology were also investigated as predictors of hiring recommendations. Findings indicate that pro-diversity messages facilitate politically motivated hiring bias. Specifically, in the presence of pro-diversity messages, White and some Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) conservatives tend to display a pro-White shift in their hiring recommendations, whereas liberals tend to display a pro-minority shift. The present research underscores the importance of organizational awareness regarding the potential for hiring managers to react, whether consciously or subconsciously, against pro-diversity efforts because of political ideology. The present research also highlights the need for organizations to move beyond just espousing pro-diversity values and actually investigate the impact diversity initiatives have on hiring, retention, and promotion of diverse employees. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Although head direction has been found to be a fundamental component of human navigation, it is unclear how self-motion signals for travel direction contribute to forming a travel trajectory. Employing a novel motion adaptation paradigm from visual neuroscience designed to preclude a contribution of head direction,we found high-level aftereffects of perceived travel direction, indicating that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation. Interestingly, we discovered a higher frequency of reporting perceived travel toward the adapted direction compared to a no-adapt control—an aftereffect that runs contrary to low-level motion aftereffects. This travel aftereffect was maintained after controlling for possible response biases and approaching effects, and it scaled with adaptation duration. These findings demonstrate the first evidence of how a pure travel direction signal might be represented in humans, independent of head direction. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

The presumed stability and generality, which underlies the prominence of loss aversion in the literature at large, has been recently questioned by studies reporting how loss aversion can disappear, and even reverse, as a function of the choice context. The present study investigated whether loss aversion reflects a trait-like attitude of avoiding losses or rather individuals’ adaptability to different contexts. We report three experiments investigating the within-subject context sensitivity of loss aversion in a two-alternative forced-choice task. Our results show that the choice context can shift people’s loss aversion, though somewhat inconsistently. Moreover, individual estimates of loss aversion are shown to have a considerable degree of stability. Altogether, these results indicate that even though the absolute value of loss aversion can be affected by external factors such as the choice context, estimates of people’s loss aversion still capture the relative dispositions toward gains and losses across individuals. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, theoretical debates highlight that such behaviors could reflect a strategic attempt to manipulate others in future interactions. The personal deterrence hypothesis claims that punishment is motivated to deter future unfairness toward punishers. Here we tested this hypothesis with a total of n = 248 five- to 10-year-olds. In two experiments, participants witnessed that a divider shared resources either fairly or selfishly with a third party. Participants learned that the same divider (same divider condition) or a new divider (different divider condition) would subsequently decide how to share resources with the participant. If children’s punishment is motivated by personal deterrence, they should punish unfairness more often in the same divider condition (vs. different divider). Conversely, if children fear retaliation from dividers, they should punish dividers less often in the same divider condition (vs. different divider). Children intervened by taking resources away from the divider (Experiment 1) or by sending a disapproving or an approving verbal message (Experiment 2). Children were more likely to punish unfair than fair allocations through material punishment and disapproving messages, while being more likely to reward fair than unfair allocations by sending approving messages. However, children did so at the same level regardless of their future divider’s identity.We discuss how these results speak to a children’s emerging concern with fairness and how it challenges the notion that children punish for self-oriented reasons as suggested by the personal deterrence hypothesis. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In other words, people tend to think of others solely as consumers, rather than as consumers as well as producers. Efficiency neglect leads to beliefs that the real costs of some consumer goods are rising when they are actually decreasing and may contribute to antiimmigration sentiments because of the fear that increasing local population creates competition for fixed resources. We demonstrate that economic pessimism and antiimmigration sentiments are reduced when people are prompted to consider their own beliefs about increased productivity over time, but are unchanged when they consider their beliefs about increases in demand.

Buddhist traditions maintain the possibility of cultivating and embodying unconditioned and universal forms of compassion. Whereas a growing body of empirical literature suggests that Buddhist-inspired compassion-based programs foster prosociality and well-being in healthy and clinical populations, there is no evidence that such compassionate disposition toward others can become unconditioned from moral judgment. To address this question, we collected and integrated self-report and behavioral data from expert Buddhist practitioners and trained novices using a previously validated within-subject experiment that manipulates contextual information to influence moral judgment toward suffering others and a newly designed approach-avoidance task. We found that context manipulation impacted responsibility and blame attribution in both groups and that experts’ reported willingness to help was higher and less influenced by context, compared to novices. Partial correlation networks highlighted a negative relationship between blame attribution and willingness to help in novices, but not in expert practitioners. Self-reported willingness to help was correlated to reaction times when approaching suffering stimuli. Approach behavior was modulated by context in novice, but not in experts. This study provides initial evidence of a dissociation between moral attributions and prosocial attitude in expert Buddhist practitioners and challenges established evolutionary accounts of compassion in western psychology. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

It is frequently assumed that the template contains a veridical copy of the target, but recent studies suggest that this is not true when the distractors are linearly separable from the target. In such cases, target representations shift “off-veridical” in response to the distractor context, presumably because doing so is adaptive and increases the representational distinctiveness of targets from distractors. However, some have argued that the shifts may be entirely explained by perceptual biases created by simultaneous color contrast. Here we address this debate and test the more general hypothesis that the target template is adaptively shaped by elements of the distractor context needed to distinguish targets from distractors. We used a two-dimensional target and separately manipulated the linear separability of one dimension (color) and the visual similarity of the other (orientation). We found that target shifting along the linearly separable color dimension was dependent on the similarity of targets-to-distractors along the other dimension. The target representations were consistent with a postexperiment strategy questionnaire in which participants reported using color more when orientation was hard to use, and orientation more when it was easier to use.We conclude that the target template is task-adaptive and exploit features in the distractor context that most predictably distinguish targets from distractors to increase visual search efficiency. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We found clear evidence of temporal crowding with central vision, even with 400 ms intervals. Critically, reduced encoding precision surfaced as a robust and unique characteristic of temporal crowding. The magnitude of central and peripheral temporal crowding was similar suggesting the involvement of higher visual areas. Precision impairment emerged even when only the target contained orientation information, excluding “response competition” as the sole interference mechanism; yet it was larger when all items included orientation information, underscoring the importance of orientation-selective mechanisms.

The present research asks two questions about whether these benefits also extend to lower-resourced institutions—that is, schools with fewer resources to invest in students than the universities where prior difference-education interventions were delivered. First, is difference-education effective in improving firstgeneration students’ academic performance in lower-resourced institutions, and does it do so by increasing empowerment? Second, does difference-education improve comfort with social group difference in lowerresourced institutions, and is it unique in its ability to do so?

Participants were randomly assigned to a control condition or interventions that (a) corrected the source’s disinformation, (b) highlighted the source’s low expertise, or (c) corrected disinformation and highlighted low expertise (Experiment 2). Next, participants rated their belief in the source’s disinformation claims and rerated their credibility. We found that highlighting low expertise was equivalent to (or more effective than) other interventions for reducing belief in disinformation. Highlighting low expertise was also more effective than correcting disinformation for reducing source credibility, although combining it with correcting disinformation outperformed low expertise alone (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 extended this paradigm to vaccine information in vaccinated and unvaccinated subgroups. A conflict-of-interest intervention and 1 week retention interval were also added. Highlighting low expertise was the most effective intervention in both vaccinated and unvaccinated participants for reducing belief in disinformation and source credibility.

Memory can guide our actions, but actions also impact what we remember. Even during memory maintenance, actions such as saccadic eye movements select content in visual working memory, resulting in better memory at locations that are congruent with the action goal as compared to incongruent locations. Here, we further substantiate the claim that saccadic eye movements are fundamentally linked to visual working memory by analyzing a large data set (.100k trials) of nine experiments (eight of them previously published). Using Bayesian hierarchical models, we demonstrate robust saccadic selection across the full range of probed saccade directions, manifesting as better memory performance at the saccade goal irrespective of its location in the visual field. By inspecting individual differences in saccadic selection, we show that saccadic selection was highly prevalent in the population. Moreover, both saccade metrics and visual working memory performance varied considerably across the visual field. Crucially, however, both idiosyncratic and systematic visual field anisotropies were not correlated between visual working memory and the oculomotor system, suggesting that they resulted from different sources (e.g., rely on separate spatial maps). In stark contrast, trial-by-trial variations in saccade metrics were strongly associated with memory performance: At any given location, shorter saccade latencies and more accurate saccades were associated with better memory performance, undergirding a robust link between action selection and visual memory. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

One typical demonstration is a social chunking phenomenon wherein the cognitive system chunks individual actions into a unified episode basing on perceived interactive actions. However, the mechanisms underlying social chunking remain to be elucidated. Most studies have adopted static images and manipulated interactions through agents’ facingness (face-to-face vs. back-to-back). Connecting agents via directed contingent actions is crucial in forming real-life social interaction. Hence, we employed dynamic actions as stimuli, separated physical- and communicative-contingency interactive actions, and predicted that domain-general physical regularities and domain-specific social relationships are crucial in social interactions, respectively. We tested this prediction by using an involuntary chunking effect in working memory, wherein two individual actions are involuntarily chunked when containing task-irrelevant interactive information. We found that involuntary chunking occurred for both types of upright interactive actions (Experiments 1, 3, 5, and 6). Inverting actions erased the chunking of communicative- but not physical-contingency actions (Experiments 2, 4, and 5). The facingness of dyads did not participate in chunking physical-contingency actions but was a prerequisite for chunking communicative-contingency actions (Experiments 3 and 6). These results reveal the dual routes of chunking interactive actions. Moreover, they suggest that the chunking mechanisms of dynamic social interaction are distinct from those of static images, highlighting the importance of using dynamic stimuli to explore the mechanisms of social interaction in emerging people-watching interdisciplinarity. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

People form impressions of others’ social class (like other important social attributes) from facial appearance, and these impressions correlate with stereotype judgments. However, what drives these related subjective judgments remains unknown. That is, what makes someone look like they are of higher or lower social class standing (e.g., rich or poor), and how does this relate to harmful or advantageous stereotypes? We addressed these questions using a perception-based data-driven method to model the specific three-dimensional facial features that drive social class judgments and compared them to those of stereo-type-related judgments (competence, warmth, dominance, and trustworthiness), based on White Western culture participants and face stimuli. Using a complementary data-reduction analysis and machine learning approach, we show that social class judgments are driven by a unique constellation of facial features that reflect multiple embedded stereotypes: poor-looking (vs. rich-looking) faces are wider, shorter, and flatter with downturned mouths and darker, cooler complexions, mirroring features of incompetent, cold, and untrustworthy-looking (vs. competent, warm, and trustworthy-looking) faces. Our results reveal the specific facial features that underlie the connection between impressions of social class and stereotype-related social traits, with implications for central social perception theories, including understanding the causal links between stereotype knowledge and social class judgments. We anticipate that our results will inform future interventions designed to interrupt biased perception and social inequalities. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The dominant view in developmental psychology is that children rely on descriptive information, “red” and “apple.” In contrast, linguistic theories of the adult language attribute primacy to grammatical elements: words such as “that” or “another” first establish the status of potential referents within the discourse context (old or new) before descriptions can factor in. These theories predict that reference can succeed even when the description does not match the referent. We explored this novel prediction in adults and children. Over four experiments, we found that (a) adults relied on the articles to identify the referent, even when the description did not fit, consistent with grammar-first accounts; (b) consistent with description-first accounts, and unlike adults, 3- to 5-year-old children prioritized the descriptions provided by nouns and adjectives, despite being sensitive to grammatical information.

Consequently, pronouns have become a focal point in academic and public debates about whether pronouns should be changed to be more inclusive, such as for people whose identities do not fit current pronoun conventions (e.g., gender nonbinary individuals). Here, we make an empirical contribution to these debates by investigating which social identities lay speakers think that pronouns should encode (if any) and why. Across four studies, participants were asked to evaluate different types of real and hypothetical pronouns, including binary gender pronouns, race pronouns, and identity-neutral pronouns. We sampled speakers of two languages with different pronoun systems: English (N = 1,120) and Turkish (N = 260). English pronouns commonly denote binary gender (e.g., “he” for men), whereas Turkish pronouns are identity-neutral (e.g., “o” for anyone). Participants’ reasoning about pronouns reflected both a familiarity preference (i.e., participants preferred the pronoun type used in their language) and—critically—participants’ social ideologies. In both language contexts, participants’ ideological beliefs that social groups are inherently distinct (essentialism) and should be hierarchal (social dominance orientation) predicted relatively greater endorsement of binary gender pronouns and race pronouns. A preregistered experimental study with an English-speaking sample showed that the relationship between ideology and pronoun endorsement is causal: Ideologies shape attitudes toward pronouns. Together, the present research contributes to linguistic and psychological theories concerning how people reason about language and informs policy-relevant questions about whether and how to implement language changes for social purposes. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Vocal loudness is often ignored, yet it might explain some puzzling exceptions to this frequency code. Here we demonstrate, through acoustic analyses of over 3,000 human vocalizations and four perceptual experiments, that vocalizers produce low frequencies when attempting to sound large, but loudness is prioritized for displays of strength and aggression. Our results show that, although being loud is effective for signaling strength and aggression, it poses a physiological trade-off with low frequencies because a loud voice is achieved by elevating pitch and opening the mouth wide into a-like vowels. This may explain why aggressive vocalizations are often high-pitched and why open vowels are considered “large” in sound symbolism despite their high first formant. Callers often compensate by adding vocal harshness (nonlinear vocal phenomena) to undesirably high-pitched loud vocalizations, but a combination of low and loud remains an honest predictor of both perceived and actual physical formidability. The proposed notion of a loudness–frequency trade-off thus adds a new dimension to the widely accepted frequency code and requires a fundamental rethinking of the evolutionary forces shaping the form of acoustic signals. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In six studies (N = 2,660), participants played a competitive game with a robot to learn about its capabilities. After the learning experience, we measured explicit and implicit competence impressions to investigate how they reflected the learning experience. We observed two distinct dissociations between people’s implicit and explicit competence impressions. Firstly, explicit impressions were uniquely sensitive to oddball behaviors. Implicit impressions only incorporated unexpected behaviors when they were moderately prevalent. Secondly, after forming a strong initial impression, explicit, but not implicit, impression updating demonstrated a positivity bias (i.e., an overvaluation of competence information). These findings suggest that the same learning experience with a robot is expressed differently at the implicit versus explicit level.

Autism is of central importance to the study of social attention, as autism is characterized by atypical social interactions and low social attention, both linked according to the social motivation theory to diminished social interest. Much evidence for positing low social interest in autism comes from eye-tracking studies, which, however, lack ecological validity. Our study documents social attention and physiological arousal, within close to real-life settings, in autistic children, as well as in their neurotypical peers, matched on gender and mental or chronological age. To explore the potential influence of partner familiarity or of the conversational topic, children gaze and electrodermal activity were recorded while they engaged in watercolor activities with, first a familiar and, next, an unfamiliar adult experimenter, who both introduced various topics. Autistic and neurotypical children exhibited comparable attention to their partners’ eyes. Notably, across all groups, heightened visual attention was directed to familiar rather than unfamiliar partners. Moreover, parallel arousal patterns emerged, with all children displaying increased skin conductance responses during more engaging topics and when looking at their interactional partner’s eyes. These findings underscore the task- and context-dependent nature of social attention and highlight the role of familiarity in an ecologically valid context. The absence of group differences challenges the universality of the social cognitive developmental theory and questions the scope of the social motivation theory of autism. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In subsequent memory tests, individuals tend to report the nonlearned lures, that is, exhibiting false memories. Priorly, the DRM task has been criticized for not capturing the aversive nature of (clinically and forensically relevant) real-life memories. To obtain a robust estimate of the influence of negative versus neutral word lists on the DRM effect, we conducted both a preregistered meta-analysis (krecall = 49, nrecall = 2,209, krecognition = 75, nrecognition = 3,008, kresponsebias = 31, nresponsebias = 1,128) and replication (nfinal = 278) predicting increased false memories for negative valence in recall and recognition. For recall, we found significant frequentist evidence in the meta-analysis for a reversed valence effect (d = −0.18, i.e., reduced false memories for negative content vs. neutral), whereas the replication displayed null results (d = 0.03). For recognition, both the meta-analysis (d = 0.23) and replication (d = 0.35) showed that negative valence (vs. neutral) increased false memories. However, this effect may be confounded by shifts in response tendencies as controlling for response bias nullified the valence effect in our meta-analysis (dmeta = 0.05), and we found evidence for differential response bias in our replication (dreplica = 0.39). Hence, the effect of valence on false memory reports in the DRM may not represent a systematic difference in emotional information but instead depend on how memory is tested, and be partly attributable to differential response tendencies. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Experiments 4 and 5 demonstrated that the breakthrough difference between facing and nonfacing pairs could not be attributed to low-level or mid-level factors.

Specifically, likelihood judgments based on two verbal forecasts (e.g., “rather likely”) are more often extreme (relative to the forecasts) than are likelihood judgments based on two numeric forecasts (e.g., “70% probability”). The goal of the present research was to investigate whether advice-takers’ use of combination strategies can be sensitive to advice independence when differences in independence are highly salient and whether sensitivity to advice independence depends on the format in which advice is given. In two studies, we found that advice-takers became more extreme with their own likelihood estimate when combining forecasts from advisors who use separate evidence, as opposed to the same evidence. We also found that two verbal forecasts generally resulted in more extreme combined likelihood estimates than two numeric forecasts.

Existing research mostly evaluates such claims based on evidence of correlations within and between feature domains. However, correlations between two identical tasks that only differ in the type of feature that is used can be inflated by method variance. Another concern is that conclusions about high-level features are mostly based on faces. We used latent variable methods on data from 237 participants to investigate the abilities supporting low-level and high-level feature ensemble judgments. Ensemble judgment was measured with six distinct tests, each requiring judgments for a distinct low-level or high-level feature, using different task requirements. We also controlled for other general visual abilities when examining how low-level and high-level ensemble abilities relate to each other. Confirmatory factor analyses showed a perfect correlation between the two factors, suggesting a single ability. There was a unique relationship between these two factors beyond the influence of object recognition and perceptual speed.

In recent years, rapid, preattentive, and preconscious fear processing has been demonstrated, providing indirect support for the existence of the subcortical pathway by challenging the necessity of canonical cortical pathways in fear processing. However, direct support also requires evidence for the involvement of subcortical regions in fear processing. To address this issue, here we investigate whether fear processing reflects the characteristics of the subcortical structures in the hypothesized subcortical pathway. Using a monocular/dichoptic paradigm, Experiment 1 demonstrated a same-eye advantage for fearful but not neutral face processing, suggesting that fear processing relied on monocular neurons existing mainly in the subcortex. Experiments 2 and 3 further showed insensitivity to short-wavelength stimuli and a nasal–temporal hemifield asymmetry in fear processing, both of which were functional characteristics of the superior colliculus, a key hub of the subcortical pathway. Furthermore, all three experiments revealed a low spatial frequency selectivity of fear processing, consistent with magnocellular input via subcortical neurons. These results suggest a selective involvement of subcortical structures in fear processing, which, together with the indirect evidence for automatic fear processing, provides a more complete picture of the existence of a subcortical pathway for fear processing in humans. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Planning requires the construction and use of an internal representation of the environment, a cognitive map. How are these maps constructed, and how do they guide goal-directed decisions? We coupled a sequential decision-making task with a behavioral representational similarity analysis approach to examine how relationships between choice options change when people build a cognitive map of the task structure. We found that participants who encoded stronger higher-order relationships among choice options showed increased planning and better performance. These higher-order relationships were more strongly encoded among objects encountered in high-reward contexts, indicating a role for motivation during cognitive map construction. In contrast, lower-order relationships such as simple visual co-occurrence of objects did not predict goal-directed planning. These results show that the construction of cognitive maps is an active process, with motivation dictating the degree to which higher-order relationships are encoded and used for planning. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, a fundamental question remains: Are perceptions of listening accurate? Prior research has not empirically tested the extent to which humans can detect others’ cognitive engagement (attentiveness) during live conversation. Across five studies (total N = 1,225), using a combination of correlational and experimental methods, we find that perceivers struggle to distinguish between attentive and inattentive conversational listening. Though people’s listening fluctuated naturally throughout their conversations (people’s minds wandered away from the conversation 24% of the time), they were able to adjust their listening in line with instructions and incentives—by either listening attentively, inattentively, or dividing their attention—and their conversation partners struggled to detect these differences. Specifically, speakers consistently overestimated their conversation partners’ attentiveness—often believing their partners were listening when they were not. Our results suggest this overestimation is (at least partly) due to the largely indistinguishable behavior of inattentive and attentive listeners. It appears that people can (and do) divide their attention during conversation and successfully feign attentiveness. Overestimating others’ attentiveness extended to third-party observers who were not immersed in the conversation, listeners who looked back on their own listening, and people interacting with partners who could not hear their words (but were incentivized to act like they could). Our work calls for a reexamination of a fundamental social behavior—listening—and underscores the distinction between feeling heard and being heard during live conversation. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Expectations of empathic bias were stronger when there was animosity and weaker when there was fondness between groups. The largest developmental differences emerged in participants’ expectations about how others feel about outgroup misfortunes, particularly when there was intergroup animosity. Whereas young children (3–5-year-olds) generally expected people to feel empathy for the outgroup (regardless of the relationship between the groups), older children (9–12-year-olds) and adults expected Schadenfreude (feeling good when an outgroup experiences a misfortune) when the groups disliked one another. Overall, expectations of empathic biases emerge early but may be weaker when there are positive intergroup relationships. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, there has been no systematic evaluation of how effective these efforts— collectively referred to as the “plain-language movement”—have been. Here we report the results of a large-scale longitudinal corpus analysis (n ≈ 225 million words), in which we compared every law passed by congress with a comparably sized sample of English texts from four different baseline genres published during approximately the same time period. We also compared the entirety of the U.S. Code (the official compilation of all federal legislation currently in force) with a large sample of recently published texts from six baseline genres of English. We found that laws remain laden with features associated with psycholinguistic complexity—including center-embedding, passive voice, low-frequency jargon, capitalization, and sentence length—relative to the baseline genres of English, and that the prevalence of most of these features has not meaningfully declined since the initial onset of the plain-language efforts. These findings suggest top-down efforts to simplify legal texts have thus far remained largely ineffectual, despite the apparent tractability of these changes, and call into question the coherence and legitimacy of legal doctrines whose validity rests on the notion of laws being easily interpretable by laypeople. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The present article addresses these questions by focusing on differences within national subgroups, exploring how national collective memories might differ for Black and White Americans, how individual differences and external influences might moderate or alter any differences, and the temporal extent of any changes that might occur due to external influences. Across four studies, participants were asked to identify the five “most important” events in U.S. history and then asked about their political ideology and racial and national identification, though not in every study. Although individual differences emerged, Black and White participants differed in the types of events they identified as important in U.S. history, with Black participants identifying more race-relevant events than White participants and White participants identifying more traditional founding events than Black participants. As to changes in collective memory, in response to a minimal identity salience manipulation, the murder of George Floyd, and July 4th celebrations, national collective memories evidenced malleability only after the murder of George Floyd. In this instance, the mention of race-relevant events increased, even as the frequency of mention of traditional founding events remained stable. The observed increase in race-relevant events was temporary, however. Findings are discussed in relation to contemporary discussions on collective memory, especially with respect to group differences, individual differences within groups, and mnemonic inertia. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The majority of evidence concerning the prevalence, triggers, and functions of nostalgia has been amassed in samples from a handful of largely Western cultures. If nostalgia is a fundamental psychological resource, it should perform similar functions across cultures, although its operational dynamics may be shaped by culture. This study (N = 2,606) examined dispositional nostalgia, self-reported triggers of nostalgia, and functions of experimentally induced nostalgia in young adults across 28 countries and a special administrative region of China (i.e., Hong Kong). Results indicated that nostalgia is frequently experienced across cultures, albeit better valued in more-developed countries (i.e., higher national wealth and life-expectancy). Nostalgia is triggered by psychological threats (especially in warmer countries), sensory stimuli (especially in more-developed countries), and social gatherings (especially in less-developed countries). The positive or negative affect prompted by experimentally induced nostalgia varied by country, but was mild overall. More importantly, recalling a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) memory increased social connectedness, self-continuity, and meaning in life across cultures. In less-developed countries, recalling an ordinary memory also conferred some of these functions, reducing the effect size of nostalgia. Finally, recalling a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) memory augmented state satisfaction with life in countries with lower quality of living (i.e., lower life-expectancy and life-satisfaction). Overall, findings confirm the relevance of nostalgia across a wide range of cultures and indicate cultural nuances in its functioning. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Given evidence for the emergence and effectiveness of these strategies across cultures, including non-Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic small-scale, traditional societies in Africa, Asia, and South America, the nonverbal displays that are used to reliably communicate these strategies also might be universal. Here, we demonstrate that the dominance display is recognized by the Mayangna, a small-scale society in rural Nicaragua, and by Canadian children as young as 2 and 3 years old. We also find that the prestige display is reliably differentiated from dominance by both groups, and judged as a high-rank signal by theMayangna. However, members of the Mayangna confused the prestige display with happiness, and children confused the prestige display with a neutral expression. Overall, findings are consistent with a ubiquitous and early-emerging ability to recognize dominance, and with the suggestion that the prestige display is more culturally variable and ontogenetically slower to emerge. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Despite nearly a century having passed since its original formulation, goalgradient-like behavior in human cognitive performance remains poorly understood: Are we more willing to engage in costly cognitive processing when we are near, versus far, from a goal state? Moreover, the computational mechanisms underpinning these potential goal-gradient effects—for example, whether goal proximity affects fidelity of stimulus encoding, response caution, or other identifiable mechanisms governing speed and accuracy—are unclear. Here, in two experiments, we examine the effect of goal proximity, operationalized as progress toward the completion of a rewarded task block, upon task performance in an attentionally demanding oddball task. Supporting the goal-gradient hypothesis, we found that participants responded more quickly, but not less accurately, when rewards were proximal than when they were distal. Critically, this effect was only observed when participants were given information about goal proximity. Using hierarchical drift diffusion modeling, we found that these apparent goal-gradient performance effects were best explained by a collapsing bound model, in which proximity to a goal reduced response caution and increased information processing. Taken together, these results suggest that goal gradients could help explain the oft-observed fluctuations in engagement of cognitively effortful processing, extending the scope of the goal-gradient hypothesis to the domain of cognitive tasks. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In Studies 1a and 1b, we find that when placing stimuli along a continuum from male to female, cisgender participants sort prototypical gender/sex faces in a bimodal fashion and show less consensus and greater error when placing faces of intermediate gender/sex. We replicate and extend these findings to race in Study 2. In Study 3, we test whether sorting patterns can be influenced by preexisting experiences, and find evidence that transgender/nonbinary participants show less error than cisgender heterosexual participants when sorting intermediary faces. Finally, in Studies 4 and 5, we test whether cisgender participants’ judgments of intermediary faces along the continuum are influenced by the specific circumstances under which they are asked to sort. Here, we find that changing the sorting framework to include a third category resulted in less error when placing intermediary faces along the continuum than when participants were provided with only two category labels or two categories and a line at the midpoint, suggesting that new perceptual categories introduced with minimal training can be adopted quickly and successfully in a perceptual task.

Despite the critical role that agency plays in the human condition, little is known about its neural basis. A novel theory proposes that increases in agency disinhibit the dopamine system and thereby increase the number of tonically active dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area. The theory, called ADDS (Agency Disinhibits the Dopamine System), proposes a specific neural network that mediates these effects. ADDS accurately predicts a variety of relevant neuroscience results, and makes many novel predictions, including that increases in an agency will (a) increase motivation, (b) improve executive function, (c) facilitate procedural learning, but only in the presence of immediate trial-by-trial feedback, (d) have little or no effect on learning-related effects of stimulus repetition or on standard eyeblink conditioning, (e) facilitate the development of automatic behaviors, but have little or no effect on the production of behaviors that are already automatized, (f ) amplify the cognitive benefits of positive mood, and (g) reduce pain.

Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5 is an example of an LLM that supports a conversational agent called ChatGPT. In this work, we used a series of novel prompts to determine whether ChatGPT shows heuristics and other contextsensitive responses. We also tested the same prompts on human participants. Across four studies, we found that ChatGPT was influenced by random anchors in making estimates (anchoring, Study 1); it judged the likelihood of two events occurring together to be higher than the likelihood of either event occurring alone, and it was influenced by anecdotal information (representativeness and availability heuristic, Study 2); it found an item to be more efficacious when its features were presented positively rather than negatively—even though both presentations contained statistically equivalent information (framing effect, Study 3); and it valued an owned item more than a newly found item even though the two items were objectively identical (endowment effect, Study 4). In each study, human participants showed similar effects. Heuristics and context-sensitive responses in humans are thought to be driven by cognitive and affective processes such as loss aversion and effort reduction.

In higher education, one critical driver of these disparities is the cultural mismatch between the interdependent norms of people from working-class backgrounds and the independent norms that pervade higher education. However, after graduating from college and entering white-collar workplaces, people from working-class backgrounds have frequent opportunities to collaborate in teams—that is, to enact interdependent behavior. Do these opportunities reduce cultural mismatch for people from working-class backgrounds? Across two survey studies and two experiments with college-educated U.S. employees (total N= 2,566),we find that they do not.We theorize and document that this is because there is often a decoupling between enacting interdependent behavior and whether such behavior is valued as part of being a “good” employee. We find that employees from working-class backgrounds only experience a cultural match and its benefits (e.g., sense of fit, high retention intentions) when interdependent behaviors are both enacted and valued. In contrast, when interdependent behaviors are enacted but not valued, employees from working-class backgrounds experience a cultural mismatch. Furthermore, we find that this pattern is unique to employees from working-class backgrounds: Employees from middle-class backgrounds report similar fit and retention regardless of whether there is a coupling of enacted and valued interdependent behavior. Taken together, our results suggest that it is critical to examine multiple elements of culture simultaneously (e.g., both enacted and valued behavior) to fully understand and predict the consequences of cultural (mis)match. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Many cognitive processes are involved in a matrix task and could potentially change with age; strategy use appears to be a good candidate, as it typically improves over development and has a large impact on reasoning performance in adults. The present study tested the role of effective strategy use in Raven’s standard progressive matrices in groups of 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, 14-, 16-, and 18-year-olds (total N = 474). Strategy use was assessed with behavioral measures of gaze patterns in Raven’s matrices. We also measured working memory capacity (WMC), a good predictor of strategy use in adults, using a battery of complex spans. The results showed that the effective strategy of constructive matching substantially increased with age, along with performance. Strategy use mediated over half the effect of age on reasoning performance. Older participants were also better at adapting strategy use to difficulty of the problems. Effective strategy use was beneficial to the same extent for participants of all ages. Age-related improvements in strategy use occurred in tandem with improvements in WMC, but did not appear to be primarily driven by them. Overall, our results indicate that strategy use is a critical underpinning of reasoning performance in children as well as in adults, and that theories of cognitive development of reasoning have to consider the central role of strategy use. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

When searching for a simple target that has been defined based on orientation, interindividual variability is high, and a large proportion of eye movements are directed to locations where peripheral vision would have been sufficient to determine whether the target was present there or not. In contrast, when searching for a target defined based on identity, eye movements are similar across individuals and highly efficient, being directed almost exclusively to the locations where central vision is most needed. The results suggest that for most people, the way they search for a simple feature (orientation) is not directly representative of theway they search for objects based on their identity. More generally, the results highlight that because humans are adaptable, contradictory theories can be accurate descriptions of search in particular contexts and individuals.

On the one hand, collectivists may feel more intertwined with and tied to those close to them, thus protecting close others more. On the other hand, they may prioritize society over individuals and thus protect close others less.

A common conclusion from the literature in psychophysics and behavioral economics is that observers subjectively compress magnitudes, such that extreme values have less sway over people’s decisions than prescribed by a normative model (underweighting). However, recent studies have reported evidence for anti-compression, that is, the relative overweighting of extreme values. Here, we investigate potential reasons for this discrepancy in findings and propose that it might reflect adaptive responses to different task requirements. We performed a large-scale study (n = 586) of sequential numerical integration, manipulating (a) the task requirement (averaging a single stream or comparing two interleaved streams of numbers), (b) the distribution of sample values (uniform or Gaussian), and (c) their range (1–9 or 100–900). The data showed compression of subjective values in the averaging task, but anticompression in the comparison task. This pattern held for both distribution types and for both ranges. In model simulations, we show that either compression or anticompression can be beneficial for noisy observers, depending on the sample-level processing demands imposed by the task. This suggests that the empirically observed patterns of over- and underweighting might reflect adaptive responses. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The deep distortions that have been studied to date are violations of the logical rules that govern incompatibility relations, such as additivity and countable additivity. Because that work is confined to laboratory word-list tasks, it is subject to the ecological validity criticism that memory for everyday facts may not exhibit such phenomena. We report evidence that memory for everyday facts displays the same deep distortions as laboratory tasks. We developed a version of the conjoint-recognition paradigm that measures memory for incompatible general knowledge facts, similar to those found on the quiz program Jeopardy! In experiments with university participants, four deep distortions were detected (violations of the additivity, countable additivity, universal set, and compensation rules), with participants consistently remembering more than what is logically possible. The distortions were more robust than in laboratory experiments, and memories of incompatible facts (e.g., Jupiter and Saturn cannot both be the largest planet in the solar system) did not suppress each other. These patterns were replicated in subsequent experiments with older and more diverse participant samples. Consistent with the notion that deep distortions are by-products of gist memory, conjoint-recognition modeling analyses revealed that memory for everyday facts was even more reliant on gist than memory for word lists, and that verbatim memory was near-floor. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We tested whether poorer representational fidelity across perception, short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM) are among the earliest signs of cognitive aging. Our paradigm probed target–lure object mnemonic discrimination and precision of object-location binding. Across the lifespan, cognitive deficits were observed in midlife when detailed stimulus representations were required for perceptual and short/long-term forced choice mnemonic discrimination. A continuous metric of object-location source memory combined with computational modeling demonstrated that errors in STM and LTM in middle-aged adults were largely driven by a loss of precision for retrieved memories, not necessarily by forgetting. On a trial-by-trial basis, fidelity of item and spatial information was more tightly bound in LTM compared to STM with this association being unaffected by age. Standard neuropsychological tests without demands on memory quality (digit span, verbal learning) were less sensitive to age effects than STM and LTM precision. Perceptual discrimination predicted mnemonic discrimination. Neuropsychological proxies for prefrontal executive functions correlated with STM, but not LTMfidelity. Conversely, neuropsychological indicators of hippocampal integrity correlated with mnemonic discrimination and precision of both STM and LTM, suggesting partially dissociable mechanisms of interindividual variability in STM and LTM fidelity. These findings suggest that reduced representational fidelity is a hallmark of cognitive aging across perception, STM, and LTM and can be observed from midlife onward. Continuous memory precision tasks may be promising for the early detection of subtle age-related cognitive decline. © 2024 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

I adopted a strategy approach and examined strategic aspects of participants’ performance under emotionally neutral and negative conditions. The data showed that negative emotions led participants to (a) use fewer strategies and change how often they used each available strategy (Experiment 1), (b) select the better strategy on each problem less often while solving both easier and harder problems (Experiment 2), and (c) obtain poorer performance (Experiments 1 and 3), even when strategy repertoire, distribution, and selection were controlled. Regarding age-related differences, I found that negative emotions (a) influenced efficiency of strategy execution less strongly in older adults than in young adults, (b) affected young adults’ strategy repertoire but not older adults’, (c) changed strategy distributions more strongly in young than in older adults, and (d) influenced strategy selection to the same extent in both age groups.

Although ample evidence suggests that cognitive control aids in the resolution of such conflict, the methods commonly used to assess cognitive control’s involvement in language comprehension provide limited information about the time course of its engagement. Here, we show that neural oscillatory activity in the theta-band (∼3–8 Hz), which is associated with cognitive control in nonlinguistic tasks like Stroop and Flanker, provides a real-time index of cognitive control during language processing. We conducted time-frequency analyses of four electroencephalogram data sets, and consistently observed that increased theta-band power was elicited by various kinds of linguistic conflict. Moreover, increases in the degree of conflict within a sentence produced greater increases in theta activity. These effects emerged as early as 300 ms from the onset of the initiating event, indicating rapid cognitive-control recruitment during sentence processing in response to conflicting representations. Crucially, the effect patterns could not be ascribed to processing difficulty that is not due to conflict (e.g., semantic implausibility was neither necessary nor sufficient to elicit theta activity). We suggest that neural oscillations in the theta-band offer a reliable way to test specific hypotheses about cognitive-control engagement during real-time language comprehension. © 2024 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Comparing numerical magnitudes is a fundamental ability that requires the processing of numerical distances. From magnitude comparison tasks, a comparison distance effect (DE) emerges: It describes better performance when comparing numerically distant rather than close numbers. Unlike other signatures of number processing, the comparison DE has been assessed only implicitly, with numerical distance as nonsalient task property. Different assessments permit identification of different cognitive processes underlying a specific effect. To investigate whether explicit and implicit assessment of the comparison DE influences numerical cognition differently, we introduced the distance classification task, involving explicit classification of numbers as close or far from a reference. N = 93 healthy adults classified numbers either by magnitude or by numerical distance. To investigate associations between numerical and physical distance, response buttons were positioned horizontally (Experiment 1) or radially (Experiment 2). In both experiments, there was an advantage for both the closest and farthest numbers with respect to the reference during distance classification, but not during magnitude classification. In Experiment 2, numerically close/far numbers were classified faster with the close/far response button, respectively, suggesting radial correspondence between physical and representational distances.

We found that participants formed stronger reward preferences for White relative to Black players despite equivalent reward feedback between groups—a pattern that was stronger among participants with low internal motivation to respond without prejudice and high explicit prejudice. This race effect in reward learning was evident in participants’ behavioral choice preferences, but not in their self-reported perceptions of group members’ reward rates. Computational modeling suggested two mechanisms through which race affected instrumental learning: race (a) influenced White participants’ initial expectancies (i.e., priors) about Black compared with White players’ behavior and (b) led participants to update reward representations of Black and White players according to separate learning rates.

Here, we investigate by what age children gain adult-like sensitivity to the image memorability effect. We utilized data from Saragosa-Harris et al. (2021), where 137 children aged between 3 and 5 years old encoded animal-scene image pairs and then after a 5-min, 24-hr, or 1-week delay performed a cued recognition task for each scene target given its animal cue. We tested adults’ memory of the same scene images using ResMem (Needell & Bainbridge, 2022), a pretrained deep neural network that predicts adult image memorability scores, and using an online behavioral continuous recognition task (N = 116). Results showed that ResMem predictions, as a proxy of adults’ memory, predicted scene memory of children by the age of 4 and were the most predictive of children’s memory across ages after a long, 1-week delay. Children at age 3 show nonadult-like consistent memory patterns, implying that the nonadult-like memory patterns were not due to poor memory performance. Instead, 3-year-olds may have consistently used certain visual memory strategies that become less optimal as they age.

Studies have shown that prospective rewards improve performance on visual working memory tasks, but it remains unclear whether rewards increase total resource availability or simply influence the allocation of resources. Participants performed a continuous report visual working memory task with oriented grating stimuli. On each trial, participants were presented with a priority cue, which signaled the item most likely to be probed, and a reward cue, which signaled the magnitude of a performance-contingent reward. We showed that rewards decreased recall error for cued items and increased recall error for noncued items. This tradeoff was due to a change in the probability of successfully encoding a cued versus a noncued item rather than a change in recall precision or the probability of binding errors. Rewards did not modulate performance when priority cues were retroactively presented after the stimulus presentation period, indicating that rewards only affect resource allocation when participants are able to engage proactive control before encoding. Additionally, reward had no effect on visual working memory performance when priority cues were absent and thus unable to guide resource allocation. These findings indicate that rewards influence the flexible allocation of resources during selection and encoding in visual working memory, but do not augment total capacity. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Such observation indicates that visual attention sequentially visits attended locations rapidly and periodically to cover multiple spatial locations, which is believed driven by a general sampling mechanism with a sampling rate invariant to the number of targets. However, a general sampling mechanism with a fixed rate would lead to the consequence that it would take longer time for attention to revisit the same item when attention needs to cover more items, which could impair perceptual continuity. It is unclear whether and how the attentional sampling mechanism can flexibly adapt to varying task demand to balance between covering more items and maintaining stable perception. Here with five behavioral experiments, we investigated how the sequential sampling mechanism adapts to the need of attending to from one to four locations. With state-of-the-art analysis methods, results show clear evidence of sequential sampling in attending to multiple locations, that both theta-band oscillations and phase-shift among different locations were observed in the behavioral performance. At each location, the oscillation period increased when the attended locations increased from one to three, maintaining a relatively stable attention-dwelling time at each location. Critically, oscillation period remained essentially the same from three to four, suggesting a flexible task-driven acceleration of attentional sampling to keep the revisiting duration within a reasonable range. Thus, our results reveal that the generally stable rhythmic attention mechanism could flexibly adjust its sampling rate to accommodate increased attentional demands. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Most of this research has assessed these relationships via isolated color swatches while confounding color dimensions. We broadened the medium in which color–emotion associations were made by manipulating color in photographs varying in valence and/or arousal, and we solely focused on the chroma dimension. In Experiment 1, participants perceived neutral and positive-valence photographs to be happier and more arousing when displayed chromatically, relative to achromatically. In Experiment 2, participants increased the chroma content of photographs to make them appear maximally happy, and they decreased the chroma content of photographs to make them appear maximally sad. In Experiment 3, participants altered the chroma content of photographs to their preferred levels, with positive-valence photographs containing the most chroma, followed by neutral, then negativevalence photographs. In Experiment 4, participants increased the chroma content of photographs to make them appear maximally positive or arousing, and they decreased chroma to make photographs appear maximally negative or calming. This pattern was similar regardless of the initial valence/arousal content of the images.

Such visual search behavior has typically been studied with tasks in which the search goal is constant and well-defined, requiring relatively little interplay between memory and orienting. Here we studied a situation in which the target is not known in advance, and instead, memory needs to be dynamically updated during the actual search. Observers compared two simultaneously presented arrays of objects for any matching pair of items—a task that requires continuous comparisons between what is seen now and what was seen a few moments ago. To manipulate the balance between memorizing and scanning, we ran two versions of the task. In an eye-tracking version, the objects were continuously available and could be scanned with relative ease. The results suggested that observers preferred scanning over memorizing. In a mouse-tracking version, perceptual availability was limited, and scanning was slowed. Now observers substantially increased their memory use. Thus, the results revealed a flexible and dynamic interplay between memory and perception. The findings aid in further bridging the research fields of attention and memory. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We propose that groups can vary in the extent to which they fit the prototype for targets of discrimination and that this variation influences judgments of discrimination in ambiguous circumstances. The present research examined attributions to discrimination when job applicants are rejected for a white-collar position. People consistently made more attributions to discrimination (ATDs) when managers rejected Black American as compared to Asian American job applicants, and when managers rejected Asian American as compared to White American job applicants. People also made more ATDs for rejected Black American as compared to Latino American applicants, but ATDs were similar for Latino and Asian American applicants. Overall, similar patterns were observed in majority White American samples and a Black/African American sample; only an Asian American sample did not make more ATDs for rejected Black than Asian American applicants. Six experiments (N = 2,321) found strong support for the relative fit hypothesis and suggest that, in a white-collar employment context, White Americans are a distant fit to the prototype for targets of discrimination, Asian and Latino Americans are an intermediate fit, and Black Americans are a close fit. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

But what makes us willing to signal our cooperativeness, when it is costly to do so? In two experiments,we tested the hypothesis that agents engage in social commitments if their subjective confidence in predicting the interaction partner’s behavior is low. In Experiment 1 (preregistered), 48 participants played a prisoner’s dilemma game where they could signal their intentions to their co-player by enduring a monetary cost. As hypothesized, low confidence in one’s prediction of the co-player’s intentions was associated with a higher willingness to engage in costly commitment. In Experiment 2 (31 participants), we replicate these findings and moreover provide causal evidence that experimentally lowering the predictability of others’ actions (and thereby confidence in these predictions) motivates commitment decisions. Finally, across both experiments, we show that participants possess and demonstrate metacognitive access to the accuracy of their mentalizing processes.

However, it remains unclear whether these three tasks in fact measure the same cognitive abilities and in the same proportion. We take a developmental approach to this question: if the Simon, Stroop, and flanker tasks all roughly measure the same capacity, they should show similar patterns of age-related change. We present data from two massive online cross-sectional studies: Study 1 included 9,585 native English speakers between 10 and 80 years of age who completed the Simon and Stroop tasks, and Study 2 included 13,448 English speakers between 10 and 79 years of age who completed the flanker task. Of the three tasks, only the flanker task revealed an inverted U-shaped developmental trajectory, with performance improving until approximately 23 years of age and declining starting around 40 years of age. Performance on the Simon and Stroop tasks peaked around 34 and 26 years of age, respectively, and did not decline significantly in later life, though it is possible that age-related declines would be observed with more difficult versions of the tasks. Although the Simon and Stroop tasks are commonly interpreted to target similar underlying processes, we observed near zero correlations between the congruency effects observed in each task in terms of both accuracy and response time.

In this study, we demonstrate that sequential processing makes visuospatial repetition learning efficient in a paradigm that employs a similar design previously used for an auditory/verbal domain. When we presented sets of color patches simultaneously in Experiments 1–4, recall accuracy did not increase with repetition; however, once color patches were presented sequentially in Experiment 5, accuracy did increase rapidly with repetition, even when participants engaged in articulatory suppression. Moreover, these learning dynamics matched those in Experiment 6, which used verbal materials. These findings suggest that (a) sequential focus on each item facilitates a repetition learning effect, indicating a temporal bottleneck is involved early in this process and (b) repetition learning is mechanistically similar across sensory modalities even though these modalities differently specialize in processing spatial or temporal information. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Here, we use the example of food to show that dysregulated rather than chronically elevated approach tendencies are associated with adverse health outcomes. To this end, we developed a new smartphone-based paradigm to measure dynamic changes in food approach tendencies outside the laboratory (piloted with n = 48). We demonstrated in three preregistered experiments (total N = 367) that food approach tendencies decrease from before to after people have eaten. We further show that in overweight and obese participants, these dynamics are disrupted as their food approach tendencies increase rather than decrease after meals. In addition to showing these effects based on traditional reaction time-based food approach tendencies, we also demonstrate these patterns in a novel measure of response force—a measure that has long been used to study motivation in animals but has received little attention in humans. Together, our findings suggest that both reaction time-based and force-based approach tendencies change dynamically in accordance with people’s need states and that disruptions in these dynamics are associated with adverse health outcomes, such as overweight and obesity. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Two of the most notable interventions of this kind are Bad News and Go Viral!. To assess their efficacy, prior research has typically used pre–post designs in which participants rated the reliability or manipulativeness of true and fake news items before and after playing these games, while most of the time also including a control group who played an irrelevant game (Tetris) or did nothing at all. Mean ratings were then compared between pre-tests and post-tests and/or between the control and experimental conditions. Critically, these prior studies have not separated response bias effects (overall tendency to respond “true” or “fake”) from discrimination (ability to distinguish between true and fake news, commonly dubbed discernment).We reanalyzed the results from five prior studies using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, a method common to signal detection theory that allows for discrimination to be measured free from response bias. Across the studies, when comparable true and fake news items were used, Bad News and Go Viral! did not improve discrimination, but rather elicited more “false” responses to all news items (more conservative responding). These novel findings suggest that the current gamified inoculation interventions designed to improve fake news detection are not as effective as previously thought and may even be counterproductive. They also demonstrate the usefulness of ROC analysis, a largely unexploited method in this setting, for assessing the effectiveness of any intervention designed to improve fake news detection. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

WM could be objectbased, such that capacity is set by the number of individuated objects, or feature-based, such that capacity is determined by the total number of feature values stored. The present work examined whether object- or feature- based models would best explain how multifeature objects (i.e., color/orientation or color/shape) are encoded into visual WM. If maximum capacity is limited by the number of individuated objects, then above-chance performance should be restricted to the same number of items as in a single-feature condition. By contrast, if the capacity is determined by independent storage resources for distinct features—without respect to the objects that contain those features—then successful storage of feature values could be distributed across a larger number of objects than when only a single feature is relevant.We conducted four experiments using a whole-report task in which subjects reported both features from every item in a six-item array. The crucial finding was that above-chance recall—for both single- and multifeatured objects—was restricted to the first three or four responses, while the later responses were best modeled as guesses. Thus, wholereport with multifeature objects reveals a distribution of recalled features that indicates an object-based limit on WM capacity. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

One central obligation of leaders is to embody the identity of their group by acting in line with group norms. Yet little is known about how leadership and conformity are initially associated in people’s minds, how this association develops in childhood, and how cultural values shape this association. The present research tested 4- to 11-year-olds in the United States and China to address these questions by comparing children’s evaluations of a leader’s versus an ordinary group member’s nonconformity. In Experiments 1 and 3 (N = 114 and 116, respectively), children saw two novel groups engage in distinct behaviors (e.g., listening to different kinds of music). A leader or a nonleader acted against their respective group norms. Next, children provided evaluations of the nonconformity. In both populations, whereas younger children (4- to 7-year-olds) evaluated the leader’s nonconformity more positively relative to the nonleader’s, older children (10- to 11-year-olds) evaluated the leader’s nonconformity more negatively. Notably, children in China developed more negative attitudes toward a leader’s nonconformity than children in the United States. Experiment 2 (N =66) ruled out the possibility that younger children’s favorable evaluations of the leader’s nonconformity stemmed from their general positivity toward leaders. Taken together, children in the two countries gradually conceptualize leaders as central group members and expect them to follow group norms. These findings contribute to theories on early leadership cognition and highlight the importance of taking a cross-cultural approach to understand its development. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Previous work suggests that children showmore cross-cultural variation in their willingness to reject allocations that would give them more rewards than their partner—advantageous inequity—as opposed to allocations that would give them less than their partner— disadvantageous inequity. However, as past work has relied solely on children’s decisions to accept or reject these offers, the algorithms underlying this pattern of variation remain unclear. Here, we explore the computational signatures of inequity aversion by applying a computational model of decision-making to data from children (N = 807) who played the Inequity Game across seven societies. Specifically, we used drift-diffusion models to formally distinguish evaluative processing (i.e., the computation of the subjective value of accepting or rejecting inequity) from alternative factors such as decision speed and response strategies. Our results suggest that variation in the development of inequity aversion across societies is best accounted for by variation in the drift rate—the direction and strength of the evaluative preference. Our findings underscore the utility of looking beyond decision data to better understand behavioral diversity. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Recent evidence suggests that incongruency between the target and subjectively reported prime identity also delays RT over and above the classic congruency effect. When the prime is rendered invisible, the former effect is fundamentally a bottom-up (BU) stimulus-driven congruency effect and the latter a top-down (TD) guess-driven congruency effect. An influential theory of consciousness, global neuronal workspace theory, postulates that the long-lasting simultaneous and reciprocal interaction between TD decision network and BU input network is preserved during conscious processing and disabled during unconscious processing. Current study is focused on testing this theoretical postulation using two behavioral experiments. Our results showed that indeed TD-congruency and BU-congruency produced additive RT effects on prime-invisible trials, which implies that TD and BU prime representations are activated in independent neuronal populations. Meanwhile, an underadditive interaction effect was observed as prime visibility rose, which is a signature that TD and BU prime representations recruited overlapping neuronal populations during conscious perception.

This has led some to suggest a primacy of bottom-up information. However, gist research has typically relied on showing successions of unrelated scene images, contrary to our everyday experience in which the world unfolds around us in a predictable manner. Thus, we investigated whether top-down information—in the form of observers’ predictions of an upcoming scene—facilitates gist processing. Within each trial, participants (N = 370) experienced a series of images, organized to represent an approach to a destination (e.g., walking down a sidewalk), followed by a target scene either congruous or incongruous with the expected destination (e.g., a store interior or a bedroom). A series of behavioral experiments revealed that appropriate expectations facilitated gist processing; inappropriate expectations interfered with gist processing; sequentially-arranged scene images benefitted gist processing when semantically related to the target scene; expectation-based facilitation was most apparent when presentation duration was most curtailed; and findings were not simply the result of response bias.We then investigated the neural correlates of predictability on scene processing using event-related potentials (ERPs) (N = 24). Congruency-related differenceswere found in a putative scene-selective ERP component, related to integrating visual properties (P2), and in later components related to contextual integration including semantic and syntactic coherence (N400 and P600, respectively). Together, results suggest that in real-world situations, top-down predictions of an upcoming scene influence even the earliest stages of its processing, affecting both the integration of visual properties and meaning. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

This study examined the transfer of (mostly) visually acquired knowledge of first- and second-language characters to the tactile modality typically not used in that acquisition process. Two experiments were conducted, one to assess letter recognition skills and one to assess digit recognition skills in both Bangla and English, in 30 sighted young children who had mastered those characters through sensory learning in natural settings. Results unequivocally demonstrated that children were able to recognize/classify the first and second language letters or digits presented not only to the (trained) visual modality but to the (untrained) tactile modality as well, and as expected, with greater recognition accuracy and shorter recognition time in the former than the latter modality. Their character recognition performance was found to be significantly influenced not by language but by character type, with digits being more accurately and more speedily recognized than letters. Moreover, language–task modality interaction was found to mediate letter recognition accuracy, digit recognition accuracy, and digit recognition time, whereas character type–task modality interaction was found to significantly mediate character recognition time only.

However, it is unknown whether neuroplasticity after visual loss also affects interoception, that is, the sensations arising from one’s inner organs that convey information about the physiological state of the body. Herein, we examine the influence of blindness on cardiac interoception, which is an interoceptive submodality that has important links to emotional processing and bodily self-awareness. We tested 36 blind and 36 age- and sex-matched sighted volunteers and examined their cardiac interoceptive ability using the heartbeat counting task. The results showed that blind individuals had significantly higher accuracy in perceiving their heartbeat than did individuals in a matched sighted control group. In contrast, there were no significant differences between the groups in the metacognitive dimensions of cardiac interoception or the purely physiological measurement of heart rate, thereby underscoring that the improved accuracy likely reflects a superior perceptual sensitivity to cardiac interoceptive signals in blind individuals. We conclude that visual deprivation leads to an enhanced ability to count one’s own heartbeats, which has important implications for the study of the extent of cross-modal plasticity after visual loss, understanding emotional processing in blind individuals, and learning how bodily self-awareness can develop and be sustained in the absence of visual experience. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Exploration choices have been well characterized in nonsocial contexts, however, choices to explore (or not) in social environments are less well understood. Social environments are of particular interest because a key factor that increases exploration in nonsocial contexts is environmental uncertainty, and the social world is generally appreciated to be highly uncertain. Although uncertainty sometimes must be reduced behaviorally (e.g., by trying something and seeing what happens), other times it may be reduced cognitively (e.g., by imagining possible outcomes). Across four experiments, participants searched for rewards in a series of grids that were either described as comprising real people distributing previously earned points (social context) or as the result of a computer algorithm or natural phenomenon (nonsocial context). In Experiments 1 and 2, participants explored more, and earned fewer rewards, in the social versus nonsocial context, suggesting that social uncertainty prompted behavioral exploration at the cost of task-relevant goals. In Experiments 3 and 4, we provided additional information about the people in the search space that could support social-cognitive approaches to uncertainty reduction, including relationships of the social agents distributing points (Experiment 3) and information relevant to social group membership (Experiment 4); exploration decreased in both instances.

We tested the role of two forms of racial diversity: that of infants’ social networks (reported by parents) and that of infants’ neighborhoods (obtained from U.S. Census data). Regardless of age, infants looked longer at other-race faces than own-race faces, but this tendency was moderated by the racial diversity of infants’ social networks. Infants with more diverse networks looked equivalently long at own-race and other-race faces, whereas those with less diverse networks looked longer at other-race faces. In contrast, infants’ looking behavior was not moderated by the diversity of their neighborhoods. Together, our research suggests that exposure to racial diversity in infants’ immediate social networks predicts how infants look to faces of different races, illustrating the context-dependent nature of the development of infants’ attention to race. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

To this end, we tested participants’ ability to estimate their own behavior in a visual search task with novel displays. In six online experiments (four pre-registered), prospective search time estimates reflected accurate metacognitive knowledge of key findings in the visual search literature, including the set-size effect, higher efficiency of color over conjunction search, and the asymmetric contributions of target and distractor identities to search difficulty. In contrast, estimates were biased to assume serial search, and demonstrated little to no insight into sizeable effects of search asymmetries for basic visual features, and of target-distractor similarity.

The target stimuli were missing from Figures 1 and 2 and have now been included. The online version of this article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2023-49083-001.) Objects influence attention allocation; when a location within an object is cued, participants react faster to targets appearing in a different location within this object than on a different object. Despite consistent demonstrations of this object-based effect, there is no agreement regarding its underlying mechanisms. To test the most common hypothesis that attention spreads automatically along the cued object, we utilized a continuous, response-free measurement of attentional allocation that relies on the modulation of the pupillary light response. In Experiments 1 and 2, attentional spreading was not encouraged because the target appeared often (60%) at the cued location and considerably less often at other locations (20% within the same object and 20% on another object). In Experiment 3, spreading was encouraged because the target appeared equally often in one of the three possible locations within the cued object (cued end, middle, uncued end). In all experiments, we added gray-to-black and gray-to-white luminance gradients to the objects. By cueing the gray ends of the objects, we could track attention. If attention indeed spreads automatically along objects, then pupil size should be greater after the gray-to-dark object is cued because attention spreads toward darker areas of the object than when the gray-to-white object is cued, regardless of the target location probability. However, unequivocal evidence of attentional spreading was only found when spreading was encouraged. These findings do not support an automatic spreading of attention. Instead, they suggest that attentional spreading along the object is guided by cue-target contingencies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).","Article","Scopus"

We used three classic psychophysical tasks (causality perception, time-to-collision, and change detection) in novel settings that dissociate body and shape.

People With Aphasia (PWA) use more manual gestures than Non-Brain Injured (NBI) individuals. This intuitively invokes the idea that gesture is compensatory in some way, but there is variable evidence of a gesture-boosting effect on speech processes. The status quo in gesture research with PWA is an emphasis on categorical analysis of gesture types, focusing on how often they are recruited, and whether more or less gesturing aids communication or speaking. However, there are increasingly louder calls for the investigation of gesture and speech as continuous entangled modes of expression. In NBI adults, expressive moments of gesture and speech are synchronized on the prosodic level. It has been neglected how this multimodal prosody is instantiated in PWA. In the current study, we perform the first acoustic-kinematic gesture–speech analysis in Persons With Aphasia (i.e., Wernicke’s, Broca’s, Anomic) relative to agematched controls, where we apply several multimodal signal analysis methods. Specifically, we related the speech peaks (smoothed amplitude envelope change) with that of the nearest peaks in the gesture acceleration profile. We obtained that the magnitude of gesture versus speech peaks are positively related across the groups, though more variably for PWA, and such coupling was related to less severe Aphasiarelated symptoms. No differences were found between controls and PWA in terms of temporal ordering of speech envelope versus acceleration peaks. Finally, we show that both gesture and speech have slower quasi-rhythmic structure, indicating that next to speech, gesture is slowed down too. The current results indicate that there is a basic gesture–speech coupling mechanism that is not fully reliant on core linguistic competences, as it is found relatively intact in PWA. This resonates with a recent biomechanical theory of gesture, which renders gesture-vocal coupling as fundamental and a priori to the (evolutionary) development of core linguistic competences. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The current study used an adaptation technique to investigate the sensory coding of perceived walking direction. We measured perceived walking direction of point-light stimuli before and after adaptation, and found that adaptation to a specific walking direction resulted in repulsive perceptual aftereffects. The magnitude of these aftereffects was tuned to the walking direction of the adaptor relative to the test, with local repulsion of perceived walking direction for test stimuli oriented on either side of the adapted walking direction. The specific tuning profiles that we observed are well explained by a population-coding model, in which perceived walking direction is coded in terms of the relative activity across a bank of sensory channels with peak tuning distributed across the full 360° range of walking directions. Further experiments showed specificity in how horizontal (azimuth) walking direction is coded when moving away from the observer compared to when moving toward the observer. Moreover, there was clear specificity in these perceptual aftereffects for walking direction compared to a nonbiological form of 3D motion (a rotating sphere). These results indicate the existence of neural mechanisms in the human visual system tuned to specific walking directions, provide insight into the number of sensory channels and how their responses are combined to encode walking direction, and demonstrate the specificity of adaptation to biological motion. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Temporal perception can influence, and be influenced by, segmenting continuous experience into meaningful events. Episodic memories formed from these events become associated with temporal information as well. However, it is less clear how temporal perception contributes to structuring events and organizing memory: whether it plays a more active or passive role, and whether this temporal information is encoded initially during perception or influenced by retrieval processes. To address these questions, we examined how event segmentation influences temporal representations during initial perception and memory retrieval, without testing temporal information explicitly. Using a neural measure of temporal context extracted from scalp electroencephalography in human participants (N = 170), we found reduced temporal context similarity between studied items separated by an event boundary when compared to items from the same event. Furthermore, while participants freely recalled list items, neural activity reflected reinstatement of temporal context representations from the study phase, including temporal disruption. A computational model of episodic memory, the context maintenance and retrieval (CMR) model, predicted these results, and made novel predictions regarding the influence of temporal disruption on recall order. These findings implicate the impact of event structure on memory organization via temporal representations, underscoring the role of temporal information in event segmentation and episodic memory. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, studies have generally not employed objective criteria against which the accuracy or appropriateness of people’s judgments about animals can be tested. We employed memory paradigms, in which judgments are clearly right or wrong, in nine experiments (eight preregistered; n=3,162). When tested shortly after exposure, meat-eaters’ memory about companion animals (e.g., dogs) but not food animals (e.g., pigs) showed an anthropomorphic bias: they remembered more information consistent with animals having versus lacking a mind (Experiments 1–4). Vegetarians’ and vegans’ memory, on the other hand, consistently showed an anthropomorphic bias regarding food and companion animals alike (Experiments 5 and 6). When tested a week after exposure, both those who eat meat and those who do not showed signs of shifting toward a mind-denying bias (Experiments 2, 3, and 6). These biases had important consequences for beliefs about animal minds. Inducing mind-denying memory biases caused participants to see animals as possessing less sophisticated minds (Experiments 7–9).

Mothers (N = 76) completed either a standardized laboratory stressor or a stressfree control task, while their middle childhood-aged children (8–12 years old) were watching. Mother–child dyads simultaneously provided multiple cortisol, heart-rate, high-frequency heart-rate variability (HFHRV), and subjective stress samples. We found that stress-group children had a greater propensity to show physiologically significant cortisol release, especially boys. Watching stressed mothers also triggered stronger subjective, state empathy, and HF-HRV stress responses, with the latter relying on elevated trait cognitive empathy ratings.

In real-world contexts, there are often several distracting events that compete for attention, but it is entirely unknown whether multiple objects can be suppressed concurrently. We used behavioral and electrophysiological measures to investigate the existence and time course of multiple-item suppression. We employed search displays that contained either one or two uniquely colored distractors that differed in their salience (S+ and S−), or no such distractors. Search performance improved with the number of salient distractors, indicating that the suppression of multiple items reduced the effective display set size. This was also the case when the target color was no longer fully predictable, ruling out an alternative explanation in terms of attentional guidance by target templates. In an experiment where S+ and S− always appeared together in the same display, the PD component (a marker of proactive suppression) was triggered exclusively by the more salient distractor (S+), indicative of single-item suppression. However, when displays with one or both salient distractors were intermixed, a reliable PD component was also triggered by S−, even when it was accompanied by S+ in the same display. These results show that multiple concurrent salient signals can be proactively inhibited. They demonstrate that signal suppression processes can be adaptively employed to counteract visual distraction at different locations, in order to facilitate the attentional selection of relevant objects in crowded visual environments. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

On the one hand, events that are compatible with our previous knowledge are thought to be remembered better than incompatible ones. On the other hand, unexpected situations, by virtue of their novelty, are known to cause enhanced learning. Several theoretical accounts try to solve this apparent paradox by conceptualizing prediction error (PE) as a continuum ranging from low PE (for expectation-matching events) to high PE (for expectation-mismatching ones). Under such a framework, the relationship between PE and memory encoding would be described by a U-shape function with higher memory performance for extreme levels of PE and lower memory for middle levels of PE. In this study, we tested the framework by using a gradual manipulation of the strength of association between scenes and objects to render different levels of PE and then tested for item memory of the (mis)matching events. In two experiments, in contrast to what was anticipated, recognition memory for object identity followed an inverted U-shape as a function of PE, with higher performance for intermediate levels of PE. Furthermore, in two additional experiments, we showed the relevance of explicit predictions at encoding to reveal such an inverted U pattern, thus providing the boundary conditions of the effect.We discussed our findings in light of existing literature relating PE and episodic memory, pointing out the potential roles of uncertainty in the environment, and the importance of the cognitive operations underlying encoding tasks. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

First, when we see a Mondrian-style image consisting only of a grid and primary colors, we may automatically interpret its causal history such that it was generated by recursively partitioning a blank scene. Second, the image we observe is open to many possible ways of partitioning, and their probabilities of dominating the interpretation can be captured by a probabilistic distribution. Moreover, the causal interpretation of a Mondrian-style image can emerge almost spontaneously, not being tailored to any specific task. Using Mondrian-style images as a case study, we demonstrate the generative nature of human vision by showing that a Bayesian model based upon an image-generation task can support a wide range of visual tasks with little retraining. Our model, learned from human-synthesized Mondrian-style images, could predict human performance in the perceptual complexity ranking, capture the transmission stability when images were iteratively passed among participants, and pass a visual Turing test. Our results collectively show that human vision is causal such that we interpret an image from the angle of how it was generated. The success of generalization with little retraining suggests that generative vision constitutes a type of common sense that supports a wide range of tasks of different natures. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Highdimensional semantic space models have recently proven instrumental in elucidating connections between words. Here we show how bigram semantic distance can yield novel insights into conceptual cohesion and topic flow when computed over continuous language samples. For example, “Cats drink milk” is comprised of an ordered vector of bigrams (cat-drink, drink-milk). Each of these bigrams has a unique semantic distance. These distances in turn may provide a metric of dispersion or the flow of concepts as language unfolds. We offer an R-package (“semdistflow”) that transforms any user-specified language transcript into a vector of ordered bigrams, appending two metrics of semantic distance to each pair. We validated these distance metrics on a continuous stream of simulated verbal fluency data assigning predicted switch markers between alternating semantic clusters (animals, musical instruments, fruit). We then generated bigram distance norms on a large sample of text and demonstrated applications of the technique to a classic work of short fiction, To Build a Fire (London, 1908). In one application, we showed that bigrams spanning sentence boundaries are punctuated by jumps in the semantic distance.We discuss the promise of this technique for characterizing semantic processing in real-world narratives and for bridging findings at the single word level with macroscale discourse analyses. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Women are less likely to be associated with desirable traits (i.e., competence), and while this bias has decreased, it persists. Ancillary analyses further suggest that song lyrics may contribute to shifts in collective attitudes and stereotypes toward women, and that lyrical shifts are driven by male artists (as female artists were less biased to begin with).

To investigate this, we fitted two different computational models to delayed estimation data assuming either separate or joint representations of continuous and categorical information in working memory, for three different, commonly used features (orientation, color, and shape). Across a set of nine experiments, model fits clearly show that feature identity drives the representation structure, with a joint-representation structure for orientation, but a separate-representations structure for color and shape.

Mental state knowledge has a rich conceptual structure, organized along key dimensions, such as valence. People use this conceptual structure to guide social interactions. How do people acquire their understanding of this structure? Here we investigate an underexplored contributor to this process: observation of mental state dynamics. Mental states—including both emotions and cognitive states—are not static. Rather, the transitions from one state to another are systematic and predictable. Drawing on prior cognitive science, we hypothesize that these transition dynamics may shape the conceptual structure that people learn to apply to mental states. Across nine behavioral experiments (N = 1,439), we tested whether the transition probabilities between mental states causally shape people’s conceptual judgments of those states. In each study, we found that observing frequent transitions between mental states caused people to judge them to be conceptually similar. Computational modeling indicated that people translated mental state dynamics into concepts by embedding the states as points within a geometric space. The closer two states are within this space, the greater the likelihood of transitions between them. In three neural network experiments, we trained artificial neural networks to predict real human mental state dynamics. The networks spontaneously learned the same conceptual dimensions that people use to understand mental states. Together these results indicate that mental state dynamics— and the goal of predicting them—shape the structure of mental state concepts. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, it was recently argued by André (2022) that if outliers are instead removed across groups, Type I error rates are not inflated. The same study discusses that removing outliers across groups is a specific case of the more general concept of hypothesis-blind removal of outliers, which is consequently recommended. In this paper, I demonstrate that, contrary to this advice, hypothesis-blind outlier removal is problematic. Specifically, it almost always invalidates confidence intervals and biases estimates if there are group differences. It moreover inflates Type I error rates in certain situations, for example, when variances are unequal and data nonnormal. Consequently, a data point may not be removed solely because it is deemed an outlier, whether the procedure used is hypothesis-blind or hypothesis-aware.

Here, we tested the generality of this finding by exposing participants to (Experiment 1; N= 125) nonhomonyms (e.g., bathtub) in sentences that biased their meanings toward a specific interpretation (e.g., bathtub-slip vs. bathtub-relax), and (Experiment 2; N =128) word-class ambiguous words (e.g., loan) in sentences where the words were used in their dispreferred word class (e.g., “He will loan me money”).

Language is an important source of such memories, from providing false inferences to outright misinformation. Here we investigate the impact of using a native or foreign language on bilinguals’ susceptibility to false memories. Although language has been argued to impact false memories in multiple ways, our study was inspired by recent work in the decision-making literature, which leads to the novel hypothesis that foreign language encourages people to engage in careful memory monitoring that could reduce false memories. This hypothesis contrasts with a processing load account, which predicts that a foreign language would increase false memories because it is naturally more difficult to process information in a foreign language. We tested these hypotheses using two false memory tasks. Using the DRM task, Experiment 1 found that individuals were more accurate in identifying false memories when using their foreign language compared with their native tongue, consistent with the memory monitoring hypothesis. Using the misinformation task, Experiment 2 found that processing misleading information in one’s foreign language eliminated false memories, again supporting the hypothesis that a foreign language increases the use of memory monitoring. These findings support a monitoring hypothesis that has been overlooked in prior studies on bilingualism and false memory, with implications for billions of people who regularly use a foreign language. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

AWS (n = 67) and adults who do not stutter (AWNS; n = 93) were recruited from an online listserv and MTurk. Across a series of trials, participants completed the PDC by using a visual analog scale to indicate their subjective value of communication as probabilities of stuttering (1%–99%) and magnitudes of negative listener reaction risk (10%, 50%, 90%) were manipulated. They also completed measures of stuttering, communication, and demographics. Results revealed communication was discounted hyperbolically across increasing dysfluency odds. AWS showed more systematic discounting patterns compared to AWNS suggesting AWS may be more sensitive to communication due to experiences with stuttering. A magnitude effect was found with both AWS and AWNS discounting communication more steeply with increasing negative listener reaction risk. Significant associations were observed between discounting, stuttering, and communication measures among AWS, which indicates that sensitivity to risk in the context of stuttering and social reaction may influence communication engagement.

COVID-19 also provides a naturalistic context by which to evaluate the ecological validity of delayed gratification.

Objects’ latent properties such as mass and hardness determine how their physical interactions will unfold, and people have a keen ability to infer these latent properties by observing physical events. For example, we can precisely discriminate the relative masses of two objects when we see them collide. However, such inferences are sometimes subject to marked biases. When inferring mass from an observed collision, people consistently overestimate the mass of an incoming object that strikes a stationary one. Why? A number of plausible accounts have been put forward, variously arguing that the bias arises from rule-based reasoning, oversimplified stimuli, or noisy perceptual estimates of the scene dynamics. The implications of these views stand in stark contrast to one another: systematic biases may reveal a fundamental deficiency in the mental model of physical behavior, or they may be an expected consequence of reasoning over imperfect information. Here, we investigated all three accounts within a unified paradigm, presenting videos of real-world bowling ball collisions. We found that using richly detailed stimuli did not eliminate biases in mass inference. However, individual differences in the biases were task-specific and well-explained by noisy perceptual estimates rather than oversimplified physical inference mechanisms. Our findings collectively point toward an intuitive physics system that implements Newtonian principles but is subject to the quality of the information it operates on. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We find that people's confidence in the possibility of hypothetical future events is strongly predicted by how similar they think the events are to events that have already happened. We find that perceived similarity explains possibility ratings better than how desirable people think the events are, or how morally good or bad they think it would be to accomplish them.

The idea of proactive suppression proposes a new fundamental perceptual mechanism to resolve this question, whereby attentional capture by a task-irrelevant salient distractor can be preempted through top-down inhibitory mechanisms. In this study, we replicate empirical effects underlying this claim, but show that they are better explained by an alternative mechanism, global target-feature enhancement. Identical to original studies using a capture-probe dual-task design, observers recalled fewer letters superimposed upon color singleton distractors, relative to other irrelevant search items (fillers). However, given that fillers (but not singleton distractors) always matched the color of the target, this effect could have been due to global featural attention to the target color rather than suppression of the singleton distractor. After manipulating the color of fillers such that they no longer matched the target color, probe recall associated with these was reduced, causing the relative “suppression” of singleton distractors to be abolished.We thenmanipulated the color similarity of targets and fillers, and found that filler probe recall was graded as a function of this color similarity, even within a single search context. This strongly suggests that increased attention to fillers due to global target color enhancement underlies the difference in attention among distractor items, not proactive distractor suppression. In contrast with feature enhancement and reactive suppression, the proposed proactive suppression mechanism still lacks convincing behavioral evidence. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In Study 2, participants were randomly assigned to learn Critical Black History, Celebratory Black History (history of achievement), or a Control lesson.

Unlike previous research focusing on specific social categories (e.g., race and age), our studies involve intersections from a large sample of salient societal groups. Study 1 provides evidence for biased information integration (vs. averaging), such that ratings of intersecting categories were more similar to the constituent with more negative and more extreme (either very positive or very negative) stereotypes. Study 2 indicates that negativity and extremity also bias spontaneous perceptions of intersectional targets, including dimensions beyond Warmth and Competence. Study 3 shows that the prevalence of emergent properties (i.e., traits attributed to intersecting categories but not the constituents) is greater for novel targets and targets with incongruent constituent stereotypes (e.g., one constituent is stereotyped as high Status and the other as low Status). Finally, Study 3 suggests that emergent (vs. present in constituents) perceptions are more negative and tend to be more about Morality and idiosyncratic content and less about Competence or Sociability.

We focus on the mechanisms underlying the meaning effects of ironic prosody (e.g., teasing or blaming through an ironic twist), which is frequently used in both personal and mass-media communication. To investigate ironic twists, we created 30 sentences that can be interpreted both ironically and nonironically, depending on the context. In Experiment 1, 14 of these sentences were identified as being most reliably understood in the two conditions. In Experiment 2, we recorded the 14 sentences spoken in both a literal and an ironic condition by 14 speakers, and the resulting 392 recorded sentences were acoustically analyzed. In Experiment 3, 20 listeners marked the acoustically prominent words, thus identifying perceived prosodic stresses. In Experiment 4, 53 participants rated how ironic they perceived the 392 recorded sentences to be. The combined analysis of irony ratings, acoustic features, and various prosodic stress characteristics revealed that ironic meaning is primarily signaled by a stress shift from the end of a sentence to an earlier position. This change in position might function as a “warning” cue for listeners to consider potential alternative meanings of the sentence. Thus, beyond giving individual words a stronger contrastive or emphatic role, the distribution of prosodic stresses can also prime opposite meanings for identical sentences, supporting the view that the dynamic aspect of prosody conveys important cues in human communication. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Most probability judgment models treat variability and bias separately: a deterministic model explains the origin of bias, to which a noise process is added to generate variability. But these accounts do not explain the characteristic inverse U-shaped signature linking mean and variance in probability judgments. By contrast, models based on sampling generate the mean and variance of judgments in a unified way: the variability in the response is an inevitable consequence of basing probability judgments on a small sample of remembered or simulated instances of events. We consider two recent sampling models, in which biases are explained either by the sample accumulation being further corrupted by retrieval noise (the Probability Theory + Noise account) or as a Bayesian adjustment to the uncertainty implicit in small samples (the Bayesian sampler). While the mean predictions of these accounts closely mimic one another, they differ regarding the predicted relationship between mean and variance. We show that these models can be distinguished by a novel linear regression method that analyses this crucial mean–variance signature. First, the efficacy of the method is established using model recovery, demonstrating that it more accurately recovers parameters than complex approaches. Second, the method is applied to the mean and variance of both existing and new probability judgment data, confirming that judgments are based on a small number of samples that are adjusted by a prior, as predicted by the Bayesian sampler. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

This capacity requires either building representations that directly reflect structure across experiences as we encounter them or deriving the indirect relationships across experiences as the need arises. Building structure directly into overlapping representations allows for powerful learning and generalization in neural network models, but building these so-called distributed representations requires inputs to be encountered in interleaved order. We test whether interleaving similarly facilitates the formation of representations that directly integrate related experiences in humans and what advantages such integration may confer for behavior. In a series of behavioral experiments, we present evidence that interleaved learning indeed promotes the formation of representations that directly link across related experiences. As in neural network models, interleaved learning gives rise to fast and automatic recognition of item relatedness, affords efficient generalization, and is especially critical for inference when learning requires statistical integration of noisy information over time. We use the data to adjudicate between several existing computational models of human memory and inference. The results demonstrate the power of interleaved learning and implicate the formation of integrated, distributed representations that support generalization in humans. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In each experiment, participants acquired probabilistic expectations about the likely strength of upcoming signals. We found these expectations about precision altered metacognition and awareness—with participants feeling more confident and stimuli appearing more vivid when stronger sensory signals were expected, without concomitant changes in objective perceptual performance. Computational modeling revealed that this effect could be well explained by a predictive learning model that infers the precision (strength) of current signals as a weighted combination of incoming evidence and top-down expectation. These results support an influential but untested tenet of Bayesian models of cognition, suggesting that agents do not only “read out” the reliability of information arriving at their senses, but also take into account prior knowledge about how reliable or “precise” different sources of information are likely to be. This reveals that expectations about precision influence how the sensory world appears and how much we trust our senses. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

In multilinguals, the degree of interaction between the articulatory plans that guide speech in each language remains unclear. Here, we directly address this question in bilingual speakers. We use a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm to drive the acquisition of novel articulatory plans for speech in one language and then measure the extent to which these new motor plans influence articulatory plans in the speaker’s other language. Twenty L1-French, L2-English bilinguals adapted their speech production to a real-time alteration of vowel sounds. In one session, the adaptation was acquired during French sentence production; in a second session, the adaptation was acquired during English sentence production. In each session, cross-language transfer of these novel articulatory plans for speech was assessed using a transfer task that involved the production of French and English words with heavily noise-masked auditory feedback. Sensorimotor adaptation that countered the vowel sound alteration was observed in both French and English. Regardless of the linguistic context in which the adaptation was acquired, the adaptation transferred to the production of words in both languages. The amount of transfer did not depend on whether the adaptation was acquired in the participant’s L1 or L2. In a second experiment, the result was replicated with 20 L1-English, L2-French speakers. The experiments support the idea that, in bilinguals, the interaction between L1 and L2 articulatory motor plans is rapid and bidirectional. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

While research on meditation practice has recently flourished, the mechanisms that might engender such changes are still poorly understood. Here, we present a motivational framework to explain why meditation training should increase concern for others and modulate empathic engagement with human suffering over time. Meditation practices are conceived as tools for enacting cognitive and emotion regulatory goals that are conditioned by the underlying ethical motivation of the training—to reduce and alleviate suffering. In support of this account, we present data from a randomized, wait-list-controlled study of intensive meditation. In Study 1, we use a novel cardiovascular index to show that 3 months of meditation training can increase the motivational salience of others’ suffering, as compared to the salience of threats to oneself. In Study 2, we demonstrate that training-related changes in the ability to orient attention to suffering are mediated by the dynamic regulation of distress-related physiological arousal. Finally, in Study 3, we provide exploratory evidence suggesting that meditation training may influence how human suffering is encoded in memory, leaving lasting imprints on the recollection of emotional experience. Together, our findings suggest that meditation training can strengthen the motivational relevance of others’suffering, prompting a shift from self-focused to other-focused evaluative processing. Considering meditation training from a motivational standpoint offers an important perspective for understanding how compassion can be cultivated through intentional practice. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Perceptual comparisons of this kind may play a mechanistic role in memory updating and can explain how memories can become erroneous in daily life. To test this possibility, we investigated whether comparisons can produce other types of memory distortion beyond memory bias that are commonly implicated in erroneous memories (e.g., memory misattribution). We hypothesized that the type of memory distortion induced during a comparison depends on the perceived overlap between the memory and incoming stimulus—when the input is perceived as similar, it biases memory content; when perceived as the same, it replaces memory content. Participants completed a delayed estimation task in which they compared their memories of color (Experiment 1) and shape stimuli (Experiment 2) to probe stimuli before reporting memory content. We found systematic errors in participants’ memory reports following perceived similarity and sameness that were toward the probes and larger following perceived sameness. Simulations confirmed that these errors were not explained by noisy encoding processes that occurred before comparisons. Instead, computational modeling suggested that these errors were likely explained by the probabilistic replacement of the memory by the probe following perceived sameness and integration between the memory and the probe following perceived similarity.

There is also evidence that ensemble coding can interact with other cognitive systems such as long-term memory (LTM), as observers are able to derive the average cost of items. We extended this line of research to examine if different sensory modalities can interact during ensemble coding. Participants made judgments about the average sweetness of groups of different visually presented foods. We found that, when viewed simultaneously, observers were limited in the number of items they could incorporate into their cross-modal ensemble percepts. We speculate that this capacity limit is caused by the crossmodal translation of visual percepts into taste representations stored in LTM. This was supported by findings that (a) participants could use similar stimuli to form capacity-unlimited ensemble representations of average screen size and (b) participants could extract the average sweetness of displays when items were viewed in sequence, with no capacity limitation (suggesting that spatial attention constrains the number of necessary visual cues an observer can integrate in a given moment to trigger cross-modal retrieval of taste).

For example, comparing VWM representations to novel perceptual inputs can induce inadvertent memory distortions. If these distortions can persist, they may explain why everyday memories often become unreliable after people perform perceptual comparisons (e.g., eyewitness testimony). Here, we conducted two experiments to assess the consequences of perceptual comparisons using real-world objects that were temporarily maintained in VWM (n=32) or recalled from visual long-term memory back intoVWM(n= 30). In each experiment, young adults reported systematic memory distortions following perceptual comparisons. These distortions increased in magnitude with the delay between encoding and comparisons and were preserved when memories were retrieved again a day later.

Parents and mentors (N = 286; 90.6% men) recruited through the U.S. Chess Federation reported their evaluations of and investment in youth players (N = 654). We found evidence of bias on some, but not all, measures. Most strikingly, parents and mentors thought that female youth players’ highest potential chess ratings were on average lower than male players’, a bias that was exacerbated among parents and mentors who believed that success in chess requires brilliance. In addition, mentors who endorsed (vs. rejected) this belief also reported that female mentees were more likely to drop out of chess due to low ability. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence of bias against youth female players and hold implications for the role of parents and mentors in other domains that, like chess, are culturally associated with intellectual ability and exhibit substantial gender imbalances (e.g., science and technology). © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We conducted two preregistered experiments to test the hypothesis that similar-sounding words flesh out deficient semantic representations. In Experiment 1, native English speakers made semantic relatedness decisions about a cue (e.g., dodge) followed either by a target that overlaps in form and meaning with a higher frequency word (evade, which overlaps with avoid) or by a control (elude), matched on distributional and formal similarity to the cue. (Participants did not see higher frequency words like avoid.) As predicted, participants decided faster and more often that overlapping targets, compared to controls, were semantically related to cues. In Experiment 2, participants read sentences containing the same cues and targets (e.g., The kids dodged something and She tried to evade/elude the officer). We used MouseView.js to blur the sentences and create a fovea-like aperture directed by the participant’s cursor, allowing us to approximate fixation duration. While we did not observe the predicted difference at the target region (e.g., evade/elude), we found a lag effect, with shorter fixations on words following overlapping targets, suggesting easier integration of those meanings. These experiments provide evidence that words with overlapping forms and meanings bolster representations of low-frequency words, which supports approaches to natural language processing that incorporate both formal and distributional information and which revises assumptions about how an optimal language will evolve. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

These implicitly learned spatial biases have been shown to be persistent, transferring to other similar visual search tasks. However, a persistent attentional bias is incompatible with frequently changing goals in our typical daily environment. We propose a flexible goal-specific probability cueing mechanism to address this discrepancy. We examined whether participants could learn and utilize targetspecific spatial priority maps across five experiments (each N = 24). In Experiment 1, participants were faster to find the target at the target-specific high-probability location, in line with a goal-specific probability cueing effect. This demonstrated that separate spatial priorities derived from statistical learning can be flexibly activated based on the current goal. In Experiment 2, we ensured the results were not driven solely by intertrial priming. In Experiment 3, we ensured the results were driven by early attentional guidance effects. In Experiment 4, we extended our findings to a complex spatial distribution including four locations, supporting a sophisticated representation of target likelihood in the activated spatial priority maps. Finally, in Experiment 5, we confirmed that the effect was driven by the activation of an attentional template and not associative learning between the target cue and a spatial location. Our findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized mechanism for flexibility within statistical learning. The goal-specific probability cueing effect relies on coordination of feature-based and location-based attention, utilizing information that crosses traditional boundaries between top-down control and selection history. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Nevertheless, the theoretical nature of attention control as a cognitive construct has been the subject of heated debate, spurred on by psychometric issues that have stymied efforts to reliably measure differences in the ability to control attention. For theory to advance, our measures must improve. We introduce three efficient, reliable, and valid tests of attention control that each take less than 3 min to administer: Stroop Squared, Flanker Squared, and Simon Squared. Two studies (online and in-lab) comprising more than 600 participants demonstrate that the three “Squared” tasks have great internal consistency (avg. =.95) and test–retest reliability across sessions (avg. r =.67). Latent variable analyses revealed that the Squared tasks loaded highly on a common factor (avg. loading=.70), which was strongly correlated with an attention control factor based on established measures (avg. r =.81). Moreover, attention control correlated strongly with fluid intelligence, working memory capacity, and processing speed and helped explain their covariation. We found that the Squared attention control tasks accounted for 75% of the variance in multitasking ability at the latent level, and that fluid intelligence, attention control, and processing speed fully accounted for individual differences in multitasking ability. Our results suggest that Stroop Squared, Flanker Squared, and Simon Squared are reliable and valid measures of attention control.

The dominating dual-process theories of reasoning detail how people (fail to) detect their reasoning errors but underspecify how people decide to correct these errors once they are detected. We have unpacked the motivational aspects of the correction process here, leveraging the research on cognitive control. Specifically, we argue that when people detect an error, they decide whether or not to correct it based on the overall expected value associated with the correction—combining perceived efficacy and the reward associated with the correction while considering the cost of effort. Using a modified two-response paradigm, participants solved cognitive reflection problems twice while we manipulated the factors defining the expected value associated with correction at the second stage. In five experiments (N = 5,908), we found that answer feedback and reward increased the probability of correction while cost decreased it, relative to the control groups. These cognitive control critical factors affected the decisions to correct reasoning errors (Experiments 2 and 3) and the corrective reasoning itself (Experiments 1, 4 and 5) across a range of problems, feedbacks, types of errors (reflective or intuitive), and cost and reward manipulations pre-tested and checked in five separate studies (N = 951). Thus, some people did not correct their epistemically irrational reasoning errors because they followed the instrumentally rational principle of the expected value maximization: They were rationally irrational. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

Speakers tend to use gestures to complement the accompanying spoken deictic constructions, such as demonstratives, when communicating spatial information (e.g., saying “The candle is here” and gesturing to the right side to express that the candle is on the speaker’s right). Visual information conveyed by gestures enhances listeners’ comprehension. Whether and how listeners allocate overt visual attention to gestures in different speech contexts is mostly unknown.We asked if (a) listeners gazed at gestures more when they complement demonstratives in speech (“here”) compared to when they express redundant information to speech (e.g., “right”) and (b) gazing at gestures related to listeners’ information uptake from those gestures. We demonstrated that listeners fixated gestures more when they expressed complementary than redundant information in the accompanying speech.Moreover, overt visual attention to gestures did not predict listeners’ comprehension. These results suggest that the heightened communicative value of gestures as signaled by external cues, such as demonstratives, guides listeners’ visual attention to gestures. However, overt visual attention does not seem to be necessary to extract the cued information from the multimodal message. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Participants (N = 17,615) in 12 incentivized studies predicted the outcomes of upcoming sporting events, the preferences of other survey responders, or the number of deaths due to COVID-19 by a future date.We then provided participants with an advisor’s best guess and manipulated whether or not that best guess was accompanied by a confidence interval. In all but one study, we found that participants were either directionally or significantly more likely to choose the advisor’s forecast (over their own) when the advice was accompanied by a confidence interval. These results were consistent across different measures of advice following and did not depend on the width of the confidence interval (75% or 95%), advice quality, or on whether people had information about the advisor’s past performance.

Here we address a central unresolved question about these maps: whether they exhibit similar characteristics across all environments, or—alternatively—whether different environments yield different types of maps. To investigate this question, we examined spatial learning in three virtual environments: an open courtyard with patios connected by paths (open maze), a set of rooms connected by corridors (closed maze), and a set of isolated rooms connected only by teleporters (teleport maze). All three environments shared the same underlying topological graph structure. Postlearning tests showed that participants formed representations of the three environments that varied in accuracy, format, and individual variability. The open maze was most accurately remembered, followed by the closed maze, and then the teleport maze. In the open maze, most participants developed representations that reflected the Euclidean structure of the space, whereas in the teleport maze, most participants constructed representations that aligned more closely with a mental model of an interconnected graph. In the closed maze, substantial individual variability emerged, with some participants forming Euclidean representations and others forming graph-like representations. These results indicate that an environment’s features shape the quality and nature of the spatial representations formed within it, determining whether spatial knowledge takes a Euclidean or graph-like format. Consequently, experimental findings obtained in any single environment may not generalize to others with different features. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

When reading words, the frequency of their occurrence (“word frequency,” WF) strongly modulates access to their meaning, as seen in recognition performance. Does the frequency of objects in our world also affect access to their meaning? With object labels available in real-world image datasets, one can nowestimate the frequency of occurrence of objects in scenes (“object frequency,” OF). We explored frequency effects in word and object recognition behavior by employing a natural versus man-made categorization task (Experiment 1) and a matching–mismatching priming task (Experiments 2–3). In Experiment 1, we found a WF effect for both words and objects but no OF effect. In Experiment 2, we replicated the WF effect for both stimulus types during cross-modal priming but not uni-modal priming. Moreover, in cross-modal priming, we found an OF effect for both objects and words, but with faster responses when objects occur less frequently in image datasets.We replicated this counterintuitive OF effect in Experiment 3 and suggest that better recognition of rare objects might interact with the structure of object categories: while access to the meaning of objects and words is faster when their meaning often occurs in our language, the homogeneity of object categories seems to also impact recognition, mainly when semantic processing happens in the context of previously presented information. These findings have major implications for studies attempting to include frequency measures in investigations of access to meaning from visual inputs. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Understanding when miscalibrated expectations emerge in development is critical for understanding when misplaced cognitive barriers might discourage social engagement and for understanding when interventions to build relationships could begin. Two experiments asking children (aged 8–17, Experiment 1; aged 4–7, Experiment 2) and adults to perform the same random act of kindness for another person document that both groups significantly underestimate how “big” the act of kindness will seem to recipients, and how positive their act will make recipients feel.

During an online differential conditioning paradigm, participants (n = 105) learned the pairing between a blue color patch (CS+) and an outcome (i.e., shock symbol) and the unpairing between a green color patch and the same outcome. After the learning task, the generalization of outcome expectancies was assessed to 14 stimuli spanning the entire blue-green color spectrum. Hereafter, a stimulus identification task assessed the ability to correctly identify the CS+ among this stimulus range. Continuous and binary color category membership judgments of the stimuli were assessed preconditioning. We found that a response model with color perception and identification performance as sole predictors was preferred to contemporary approaches that use stimulus as a predictor. Interestingly, incorporating interindividual differences in color perception, CS identification, and color categories significantly improved the models’ ability to account for different generalization patterns.

In order to examine the role of speechbased phonological codes when reading, we utilized eye-tracking to examine eye-gaze behaviors employed by deaf children and a control group of hearing primary-school children when encountering target words in sentences. The target words were of three types: correct, homophonic errors, and nonhomophonic errors.We examined eye-gaze fixations when first encountering target words and, if applicable, when rereading those words. The results revealed that deaf and hearing readers differed in their eye-movement behaviors when rereading the words, but they did not demonstrate differences for first encounters with the words. Hearing readers treated homophonic and nonhomophonic error words differently during their second encounter with the target while deaf readers did not, suggesting that deaf signers did not engage in phonological decoding to the same degree as hearing readers did. Further, deaf signers performed fewer overall regressions to target words than hearing readers, suggesting that they depended less on regressions to resolve errors in the text. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Yet, even when we forget exactly what others said or did, we often remember impressions that capture a general gist of their behavior—whether they were forthright, friendly, or funny. Drawing on fuzzy trace theory, we propose two modes of social impression formation: impressions formed based on ordinal gist (“more competent,” “less competent”) or categorical gist (“competent,” “incompetent”). In turn, we propose that people gravitate toward the simplest representation available and that different modes of memory have distinct consequences for social decisions. Specifically, ordinal impressions lead people to make decisions based on an individual’s standing relative to others, whereas categorical impressions lead people to make decisions based on discrete classifications that interpret behavior. In four experiments, participants learned about two groups of individuals who differed in their competence (Studies 1a, 2, and 3) or generosity (Study 1b). When participants encoded impressions as ordinal rankings, they preferred to hire or help a relatively good target from a low-performing group over a relatively bad target from a high-performing group, even though both targets behaved identically and accuracy was incentivized. However, when participants could use categorical boundaries to interpret behavior, this preference was eliminated. In a final experiment, changing the category participants used to encode others’ generosity changed their impressions, even when accounting for memory for verbatim details. This work links social impressions to theories of mental representation in memory and judgment, highlighting how distinct representations support divergent patterns of social decision-making. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We propose that Pavlovian control is additionally useful if flexibly recruited by instrumental control. Specifically, instrumental action plans might shape selective attention to reward/punishment information and thus the input to Pavlovian control. In two eye-tracking samples (N = 35/64), we observed that Go/NoGo action plans influenced when and for how long participants attended to reward/punishment information, which in turn biased their responses in a Pavlovian manner.

The present study is the first to use a trait and state decomposition approach to formally quantify the reliability of inhibitory control and to examine its hierarchical structure. N = 150 participants carried out antisaccade, Eriksen flanker, go/nogo, Simon, stop-signal, and Stroop tasks on three occasions. By applying latent state–trait modeling and latent growth-curve modeling, reliability was estimated and divided into the amount of variance explained by trait effects and trait changes (consistency) and the amount of variance explained by situational effects and effects of Situation x Person interaction (occasion specificity). Mean reaction times for all tasks revealed excellent reliabilities (.89–.99). Importantly, on average, 82% of variance was accounted for by consistency while specificity was rather small. Although primary inhibitory variables revealed lower reliabilities (.51–.85), the majority of explained variancewas again trait determined. Trait changeswere observed for most variables and were strongest when comparing the first occasion to later ones. In addition, in some variables, those improvements were particularly high in initially underperforming subjects. An analysis of the construct of inhibition on trait level showed that communality between tasks was low. We conclude that most variables in inhibitory control tasks are mainly affected by stable trait effects, but there is only little evidence of a common, underlying inhibitory control construct at trait level. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

To address this question, we used a continuous recall paradigm to directly compare the distraction effect during encoding and the delay periods. Across Experiments 1–3, we observed a substantial distraction-related cost on mnemonic fidelity when distractors presented during the delay (delaydistraction condition), but not if they were introduced at encoding (encoding-distraction condition) or across both periods (full-distraction condition).However, the distraction cost revived whenwe increased the difficulty to distinguish distractors from targets (Experiments 4 and 4S) and when we changed distractors’ relevant features during the delay (Experiment 5). We also found that the robust distraction cost in the delay-distraction condition did not occupy extra spatial resources (Experiments 6a and 6b). These results suggested a dissociated distraction effect, which could be related to the dynamic resource allocation across twoWMperiods. Here, we proposed a Bayesian model and considered the task relevance and visual uncertainty as two main factors that determine the resource allocation principle at two different stages. This model successfully captured the main findings across all behavioral experiments and performed better than other alternative models. Taken together, the current work advanced our understanding of the distraction resistance ofWMunder the framework of limited resource allocation. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

This process seems to be inevitable because robots have ever-expanding capabilities. However, drawing from theories of cultural evolution and social learning, we propose that robots may have limited influence in domains that require high degrees of “credibility”; here we focus on the automation of religious preachers as one such domain. Using a natural experiment in a recently automated Buddhist temple (Study 1) and a fully randomized experiment in a Taoist temple (Study 2), we consistently show that religious adherents perceive robot preachers—and the institutions which employ them—as less credible than human preachers. This lack of credibility explains reductions in religious commitment after people listen to robot (vs. human) preachers deliver sermons. Study 3 conceptually replicates this finding in an online experiment and suggests that religious elites require perceived minds (agency and patiency) to be credible, which is partly why robot preachers inspire less credibility than humans. Our studies support cultural evolutionary theories of religion and suggest that escalating religious automation may induce religious decline. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

They combine their knowledge of the visuospatial context with reasoning about the other person’s knowledge state and rely on shared assumptions about how language is used to express communicative intentions. However, these assumptions may differ between languages of nonindustrialized—where conversations often primarily take place within a, so-called, society of intimates—and industrialized cultures—societies of strangers. Here, we study inference in communication in the Tsimane’, an indigenous people of the Bolivian Amazon, who have little contact with industrialization or formal education. Using a referential communication task, we probe how Tsimane’ speakers refer to objects in the world around them when there are potential ambiguities (e.g., referring to a cup when there are multiple cups in view) across different visual contexts. Using an eye-tracking task, we probe the realtime inferences that Tsimane’ listeners make about the speaker’s intentions.We find that Tsimane’ speakers use visual (color, size) contrasts to disambiguate referents (e.g., “Hand me the small cup”), much like English speakers, and they predictively direct their gaze to objects in a contrast set when they hear a modifier (e.g., “small”). Despite myriad cultural and linguistic dissimilarities between the two populations, the qualitative patterns of behavior and eye-gaze of Tsimane’ and English speakers were strikingly similar, suggesting that the communicative expectations underlying many everyday inferences may be shared across cultures. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We propose that there are separate systems for processing local and global shape. These systems are independent and process information differently. Global shape encoding accurately represents the form of low-frequency contour variations, whereas the local system encodes only summary statistics that describe typical features of high-frequency elements. In Experiments 1–4, we tested this hypothesis by obtaining same/different judgments for shapes that differed in local features, global features, or both. We found low sensitivity to changed local features that shared the same summary statistics, and no advantage in sensitivity for shapes that differed in both local and global features compared to shapes that differed only in global features. This sensitivity difference persisted when physical contour differences were equated and when shape feature sizes and exposure durations were increased. In Experiment 5, we compared sensitivity to sets of local contour features with matched or unmatched statistical properties. Sensitivity was higher for unmatched statistical properties than for properties sampled from the same statistical distribution. Experiment 6 directly tested our hypothesis of independent local and global systems using visual search. Search based on either local or global shape differences produced pop-out effects, but search for a target based on a conjunction of local and global differences required focal attention. These findings support the notion that separate mechanisms process local and global contour information and that the kinds of information these mechanisms encode are fundamentally different. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

EFs are usually measured via behavioral tasks assessed in highly controlled laboratory settings under the supervision of a research assistant. Online versions of EF tasks are an increasingly popular alternative to in-lab testing. However, researchers do not have the same control over the testing environment during online EF assessments. To assess the extent to which EFs assessed in-lab and online are related, we used data from the Colorado Online Twin Study (CoTwins; 887 individual twins aged 13.98–19.05) and constructed an Lab Common EF factor and an Online Common EF factor from four EF tasks assessed in-lab and online. The Lab Common and Online Common EF factors were genetically identical (rA= 1.00) but phenotypically separable (r=.77, 95% confidence interval [0.59, 0.94]) indicating that these EF factors have the same genetic underpinnings but may be differentially influenced by environmental factors. We examined phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations between the EF factors and a general cognitive ability factor (g) assessed in the lab and found similar relationships between Lab Common EF and g and Online Common EF and g. Overall, these results suggest that Common EF factors assessed in different contexts are highly related to each other and similarly related to other cognitive outcomes. These findings indicate that online task-based EF assessments could be a viable strategy for increasing sample sizes in large-scale studies, particularly genetically informed studies. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

This occurred for extrinsic reward tradeoffs (Experiments 1, 3, 4, and 5) and intrinsic reward tradeoffs (Experiments 2 and 6), and it persisted even when participants explicitly noted the rewards of each task (Experiment 3).We sought but did not find evidence that the tendency is moderated by participants’ stable or momentary level of concern with monitoring multiple responsibilities (Experiments 4 and 5, respectively).We did find that the opportunity to complete the final step in a sequence was particularly attractive: Setting the lower-reward task closer to completion (but with completion still out of reach) did increase its choice share, but setting the lower-reward task with completion distinctly in reach increased its choice share even more (Experiment 6).

This positive gaze preference sometimes improves older adults’ mood compared to their younger counterparts. However, the lab environment may lead to different emotion regulation behavior among older adults compared to what they do in their everyday life. We, therefore, present the first use of stationary eye-tracking within participants’ homes to examine gaze patterns toward video clips of varying valence and to study age differences in emotional attention among younger, middle-aged, and older adults in a more naturalistic environment.We also compared these results to in-lab gaze preferences among the same participants. Older adults deployed attention more to positive stimuli in the lab but more to negative stimuli in the home. This increased attention to negative content in the home predicted higher self-reported arousal outcomes among middle-aged and older adults. Gaze preferences toward emotional stimuli may thus differ depending on the context, emphasizing the need to explore more naturalistic settings within emotion regulation and aging research. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

But how do people determine whether one object supports another? In this paper, we develop a counterfactual simulation model (CSM) of causal judgments about physical support. The CSM predicts that people judge physical support by mentally simulating what would happen to a scene if the object of interest was removed. Three experiments test the model by asking one group of participants to judge what would happen to a tower if one of the blocks were removed, and another group of participants how responsible that block was for the tower’s stability. The CSM accurately captures participants’ predictions by running noisy simulations that incorporate different sources of uncertainty. Participants’ responsibility judgments are closely related to counterfactual predictions: a block is more responsible when many other blocks would fall if it were removed. By construing physical support as preventing from falling, the CSM provides a unified account of how causal judgments in dynamic and static physical scenes arise from the process of counterfactual simulation. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Previous answers to this question have generally focused on the perceived deficits of parents from disadvantaged backgrounds (e.g., insufficient childrearing knowledge). Here, we instead focus on the structure of early childhood education and argue that early schooling contexts provide unequal opportunities for engagement to children of higher versus lower socioeconomic status (SES). As engagement is a longitudinal predictor of achievement, early SES disparities in engagement could serve to maintain or even exacerbate SES disparities in achievement. In Study 1 (1,236 observations; N = 98 children), we investigated preschool students’ behavioral engagement during whole-class discussions—a core aspect of early childhood education. Low-SES children showed significantly lower engagement than their peers. Consistent with the claim of unequal opportunities for engagement, these differences were not accounted for by SES differences in language proficiency. As students’ engagement in school is influenced by their peers’ attitudes toward them, we also examined peer perceptions (Study 2, N = 94, and a meta-analysis, k= 2 studies). We found that preschoolers who show more engagement relative to others during whole-class discussions are perceived as possessing more positive qualities (e.g., intelligence). Given that higher-SES students are afforded more opportunities for engagement (see Study 1), they may be the ones benefiting from these positive peer perceptions as well, which might further boost their engagement. Our results suggest that aspects of early childhood education should be redesigned to foster engagement among all students, regardless of their SES. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Yet, the effortful nature of WM remains poorly understood. Here, we constructed a model to evaluate how perceived effort of WM is directly compared to that of physical exertion. In Experiment 1, participants freely chose to either remember a certain number of colors in a visual WM task or hold a hand dynamometer to a required percentage of maximal voluntary contraction (%MVC) to obtain a fixed task credit upon successful task completion. We found that participants discounted WM-related effort in the same way as they discounted handgrip-related effort based on a computation of expected choice outcomes (hence utility) associated with different task loads. This rationality in an observer’s prospective choice in Experiment 1 was generalized to retrospective choice in Experiment 2 where participants reported which task was more effortful immediately after they had performed both tasks in a randomized order without any reward or feedback. Experiment 3 further probed this shared mechanism using a dual-task paradigm. As predicted by our model, we found that physical exertion could disrupt the performance in the concurrent WM task, proportional to the iso-effort relationship between WM and physical exertion when task loads were high for both tasks.

However, one key limitation in current approaches is that most studies have focused on confidence judgments made for single decisions. In three experiments, we investigate how these local confidence judgments relate and contribute to global confidence judgments, by which observers summarize their performance over a series of perceptual decisions. We report two main results. First, we find that participants exhibit more overconfidence in their local than in their global judgments of performance, an observation mirroring the aggregation effect in knowledgebased decisions. We further show that this effect is specific to confidence judgments and does not reflect a calculation bias. Second, we document a novel effect by which participants’ global confidence is larger for sets which are more heterogeneous in terms of difficulty, even when actual performance is controlled for. Surprisingly, we find that this effect of variability also occurs at the level of local confidence judgments, in a manner that fully explains the effect at the global level. Overall, our results indicate that global confidence is based on local confidence, although these two processes can be partially dissociated.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2023-15561-001). Many studies investigating first impressions from faces employ stimulus sets that comprise only White faces. It is argued that participants lack the necessary perceptual expertise to provide reliable trait evaluations when viewing faces from ethnicities that differ from their own. In combination with a reliance on White and WEIRD participants, this concern has contributed to the widespread use of White face stimuli in this literature. The present study sought to determine whether concerns about the use of so-called other-race faces are justified by assessing the test-retest reliability of trait judgments made about same- and other-race faces. In two experiments conducted on 400 British participants, we find that White British participants made reliable trait judgments about Black faces, and Black British participants made reliable trait judgments about White faces. It is important that future work be conducted to determine how widely these results generalize. Considering our findings, however, we suggest (a) that the default assumption in future first impressions research should be that participants-particularly those recruited from diverse communities-are able to form reliable first impressions of other-race faces and (b) that faces of color be included in stimulus sets whenever possible.

Drawing on a signal-detection framework, the current research investigated two distinct aspects of misinformation susceptibility: truth sensitivity, conceptualized as accurate discrimination between true and false information, and partisan bias, conceptualized as lower acceptance threshold for ideology-congruent information compared to ideology-incongruent information. Four preregistered experiments (n= 2,423) examined (a) truth sensitivity and partisan bias in veracity judgments and decisions to share information and (b) determinants and correlates of truth sensitivity and partisan bias in responses to misinformation. Although participants were able to distinguish between true and false information to a considerable extent, sharing decisions were largely unaffected by actual information veracity. A strong partisan bias emerged for both veracity judgments and sharing decisions, with partisan bias being unrelated to the overall degree of truth sensitivity. While truth sensitivity increased as a function of cognitive reflection during encoding, partisan bias increased as a function of subjective confidence. Truth sensitivity and partisan bias were both associated with misinformation susceptibility, but partisan bias was a stronger and more reliable predictor of misinformation susceptibility than truth sensitivity. Implications and open questions for future research are discussed. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, experimental evidence, media portrayals, and personal experience about the debilitating nature of stress may challenge this mindset. Thus, the traditional approach of focusing on the more “desired” mindset without arming participants against encounters with the less desired mindsets may not be sustainable in the face of conflicting information. How might this limitation be resolved? Here, we present three randomized-controlled interventions that test the efficacy of a “metacognitive approach.” In this approach, participants are givenmore balanced information about the nature of stress along with metacognitive information on the power of their mindsets aimed at empowering them to choose a more adaptive mindset even in the face of conflicting information. In Experiment 1, employees of a large finance company randomized to the metacognitive mindset intervention reported greater increases in stress-is-enhancing mindsets and greater improvements in self-reported measures of physical health symptoms and interpersonalskill work performance 4weeks later compared to awaitlist control. Experiment 2, adapted to be distributed electronically via multimedia modules, replicates the effects on stress mindset and symptoms. Experiment 3 compares the metacognitive stress mindset intervention with a more traditional stress mindset manipulation. The metacognitive approach led to greater initial increases in a stress-is-enhancing mindset relative to the traditional intervention, and these increases were sustained after exposure to contradictory information. Taken together, these results provide support for a metacognitive approach to mindset change. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

For the language domain, we adopted the “tongue twister” paradigm, while for the action domain, we developed an analogous key-pressing task, “finger fumblers.” Our results show that both language and action plans benefit from reusing segments of prior plans: when onsets were repeated between adjacent units in a sequence, the error rates decreased. Our results also suggest that this facilitation is most effective when the planning scope is limited, that is, when participants plan ahead only to the next immediate units in the sequence. Alternatively, when the planning scope covers a wider range of the sequence, we observe more interference from the global structure of the sequence that requires changing the order of repeated units. We point to several factors that might affect this balance between facilitation and interference in plan reuse, for both language and action planning. Our findings support similar domain-general planning principles guiding both language production and motor action. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

There is a debate in the literature about why people spread misinformation and what should be done about it. According to the purely cognitive account, people largely spread misinformation because they are lazy, not biased. According to a motivational account, people are also motivated to believe and spread misinformation for ideological and partisan reasons. To better understand the psychological and neurocognitive processes that underlie misinformation sharing among the far-right, we conducted a cross-cultural experiment with conservatives and far-right partisans in the Unites States and Spain (N= 1,609) and a neuroimaging study with far-right partisans in Spain (N = 36). Far-right partisans in Spain and U.S. Republicans who highly identify with Trump were more likely to share misinformation than center-right voters and other Republicans, especially when the misinformation was related to sacred values (e.g., immigration). Sacred values predicted misinformation sharing above and beyond familiarity, attitude strength, and salience of the issue. Moreover, far-right partisans were unresponsive to fact-checking and accuracy nudges. At a neural level, this group showed increased activity in brain regions implicated in mentalizing and norm compliance in response to posts with sacred values. These results suggest that the two components of political devotion—identity fusion and sacred values—play a key role in misinformation sharing, highlighting the identity-affirming dimension of misinformation sharing. We discuss the need for motivational and identity-based interventions to help curb misinformation for high-risk partisan groups. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

While domain knowledge and reasoning abilities are necessary for making accurate forecasts, research shows that knowing how accurate forecasters have been in the past is the best predictor of future accuracy. However, unlike the measurement of other traits, evaluating forecasting skill requires substantial time investment. Forecasters must make predictions about events that may not resolve for many days, weeks, months, or even years into the future before their accuracy can be estimated. Our work builds upon methods such as cultural consensus theory and proxy scoring rules to show talented forecasters can be discriminated in real time, without requiring any event resolutions. We define a peer similarity-based intersubjective evaluation method and test its utility in a unique longitudinal forecasting experiment. Because forecasters predicted all events at the same points in time, many of the confounds common to forecasting tournaments or observational data were eliminated. This allowed us to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in real time, as time progressed and more information about forecasters became available. Intersubjective accuracy scores, which can be obtained immediately after the forecasts are made, were both valid and reliable estimators of forecasting talent. We also found that asking forecasters to make meta-predictions about what they expect others to believe can serve as an incentive-compatible method of intersubjective evaluation. Our results indicate that selecting small groups of, or even single forecasters, based on intersubjective accuracy can yield subsequent forecasts that approximate the actual accuracy of much larger crowd aggregates. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We take a complementary approach by investigating the conditions under which interpersonal concerns drive selective exposure. Drawing on a large literature on impression management, we test a social signaling model of selective exposure, which predicts that (a) individuals shift their information selection decisions to signal to observers and (b) observers reward such shifts. We test this model in the domain of partisan politics in the United States across five financially incentivized, preregistered experiments (N = 3,598). Our results extend prior theory by identifying three key contingencies: the type of task on which observers expect to collaborate with actors, alignment of group membership between observers and actors, and the magnitude of demonstrated selective exposure. Overall, we find that tailoring one’s information selection decisions can indeed have strategic value—but only under certain theoretically predictable conditions. Our work also identifies an actor–observer misalignment: While observers are sensitive to the type of future interaction with an actor, the actors themselves do not intuit this sensitivity. In the era of social media, when information selection decisions are more public than ever and the spread of misinformation is pervasive, understanding the ways in which reputational considerations shape decision making not only illuminates why selective exposure persists, but also suggests novel mitigation strategies. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Various laboratory tasks, which differ in stimuli features and task procedures, can quantify negative interpretation bias. However, it is unknown whether these tasks globally predict individual differences in real-world negative (NA) and positive (PA) affect. Across two studies, we tested whether different labbased negative interpretation bias tasks predict daily NA and PA, measured via mobile phone across months. To quantify negative interpretation bias, Study 1 (N = 69) used a verbal, self-referential task whereas Study 2 (N = 110) used a perceptual, emotional image task with faces and scenes. Across tasks, negative interpretation bias was linked to heightened daily NA. However, only negative interpretation bias in response to ambiguous faces was related to decreased daily PA.

However, it is often questioned whether people are really able to know the exact shape of signal and noise distributions, and compute the objective LR accordingly. Herewe suggest whether decision criteria are set based on objective LRcan be tested in two-condition experiments with different difficulty levels across conditions.We then asked participants in three empirical experiments to perform two-condition perceptual or memory tasks, and give their answer using confidence rating scale. Results revealed that the two assumptions of LR theory contradicted with each other: if we assumed decision criteria were based on objective LR, then the estimated LR criteria differed across difficulty levels, and fanned out as task difficulty decreased.We suggest people might inaccurately estimate the LR in signal detection tasks, and several possible explanations for the distortion of LR are discussed. © (2023) American Psychological Association.","Article","Scopus"

The lexical frequency of upcoming words and similarity with subsequent foveal information both influence the amount of time people spend once they fixate the word foveally. However, it is unclear from eye movements alone the extent to which parafoveal word processing, and the integration of that word with foveally obtained information, continues after saccade plans have been initiated. To investigate the underlying neural processes involved in word recognition after saccade planning, we coregistered electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye movements during a gaze-contingent display change paradigm. We orthogonally manipulated the frequency of the parafoveal and foveal words and measured fixation related potentials (FRPs) upon foveal fixation. Eye movements showed primarily an effect of preview frequency, suggesting that saccade planning is based on the familiarity of the parafoveal input. FRPs, on the other hand, demonstrated a disruption in downstream processing when parafoveal and foveal input differed, but only when the parafoveal word was high frequency. These findings demonstrate that lexical processing continues after the eyes have moved away from a word and that eye movements and FRPs provide distinct but complementary accounts about oculomotor behavior and neural processing that cannot be obtained from either method in isolation. Furthermore, these findings put constraints on models of reading by suggesting that lexical processes that occur before an eye movement program is initiated are qualitatively different from those that occur afterward. © 2022 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In Studies 3a–6b (total N = 4,851; preregistered), we manipulated perceived inequality and test several mediating pathways. Results point toward the importance of sense of control as a mechanism: Under conditions of high inequality, individuals report a lower sense of control, which increases the acceptability of self-interested unethical behaviors. As a supplement, we also explore associations regarding why high inequality reduces sense of control (reduced perceptions of social mobility) and why sense of control is associated with greater acceptability of unethical behavior (greater situational attributions).

Here, we propose that collaboration is grounded in an intuitive understanding of how others think and of what they can do—in other words, of their mental states and competence. We present a belief–desire– competence framework that formalizes this proposal by extending existing models of commonsense psychological reasoning. Our framework predicts that agents recursively reason how much effort they and their partner will allocate to a task, based on the rewards at stake and on their own and their collaborator’s competence. Across three experiments (N =249), we show that the belief–desire–competence framework captures human judgments in a variety of contexts that are critical to collaboration, including predicting whether a joint activity will succeed (Experiment 1), selecting incentives for collaborators (Experiment 2), and choosing which individuals to recruit for a collaborative task (Experiment 3).

In Experiment 3, spreading was encouraged because the target appeared equally often in one of the three possible locations within the cued object (cued end, middle, uncued end). In all experiments, we added gray-to-black and gray-to-white luminance gradients to the objects. By cueing the gray ends of the objects, we could track attention. If attention indeed spreads automatically along objects, then pupil size should be greater after the gray-to-dark object is cued because attention spreads toward darker areas of the object than when the gray-to-white object is cued, regardless of the target location probability. However, unequivocal evidence of attentional spreading was only found when spreading was encouraged. These findings do not support an automatic spreading of attention. Instead, they suggest that attentional spreading along the object is guided by cue–target contingencies. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We explore teleological endorsement in a novel domain— human purpose—and its relationship to moral judgments. Across studies conducted online with a sample of U.S.-recruited adults, we ask: (a) Do participants believe the human species exists for a purpose? (b) Do these beliefs predict moral condemnation of individuals who fail to fulfill this purpose? And (c) what explains the link between teleological beliefs and moral condemnation? Study 1 found that participants frequently endorsed teleological claims about humans existence (e.g., humans exist to procreate), and these beliefs correlated with moral condemnation of purpose violations (e.g., condemning those who do not procreate). Study 2 found evidence of a bidirectional causal relationship: Stipulating a species’ purpose results in moral condemnation of purpose violations, and stipulating that an action is immoral increases endorsement that the species exists for that purpose. Study 3 found evidence that when participants believe a species exists to perform some action, they infer this action is good for the species, and this in turn supports moral condemnation of individuals who choose not to perform the action. Study 4 found evidence that believing an action is good for the species partially mediates the relationship between human purpose beliefs and moral condemnation.

Specifically, we investigated whether bilingual infants orient more rapidly to new information. Capitalizing on a classic paradigm by Fantz (1964), monolingual and bilingual infants (5–6 months and 8–9 months) were simultaneously presented with familiar and novel stimuli. As they received increased exposure to the familiar and novel stimuli, monolingual infants demonstrated a null preference, followed by a novelty preference, as previously evidenced in Fantz’s study.

People will make choices that minimize the need to perform such tasks and will even accept some measure of physical pain in exchange for the ability to avoid them. Nearly all tasks require that people find and extract relevant perceptual information from their environment, but demands of this nature are often ignored in the study of mental effort. Visual search is sometimes described as “difficult” or “easy” on the basis of search slopes or other performance-based metrics, but how such performance differences map onto conceptions of cognitive demand is unclear. In the present study, we examined whether people would be willing to exert physical effort in exchange for the opportunity to minimize the number of items they needed to search through in a visual search task and whether they would be more willing to endure physical effort demands if it resulted in fewer items needing to be searched. Our results are broadly consistent with the idea that the performance of visual search constitutes effortful work that can trade-off with physical effort demands, which has broad implications for theories of visual information processing and practical considerations for professions that tax peoples’ ability to search. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

This hindsight bias—traditionally considered to reflect a cognitive error—has more recently been proposed to result from adaptive knowledge updating. But how to conceptualize such knowledge-updating processes and their potentially beneficial consequences? Here, we provide a framework that conceptualizes knowledge updating in the context of hindsight bias in real-world estimation by connecting it with research on seeding effects—improvements in people’s estimation accuracy after exposure to numerical facts. This integrative perspective highlights a previously neglected facet of knowledge updating, namely, recalibration of metric domain knowledge, which can be expected to lead to transfer learning and thus improve estimation for objects from a domain more generally.We develop an experimental paradigm to investigate the association of hindsight bias with improved estimation accuracy. In Experiment 1, we demonstrate that the classical approach to induce hindsight bias indeed produces transfer learning. In Experiment 2, we provide evidence for the novel prediction that hindsight bias can be triggered via transfer learning; this establishes a direct link from knowledge updating to hindsight bias. Our work integrates two prominent but previously unconnected research programs on the effects of knowledge updating in real-world estimation and supports the notion that hindsight bias is driven by adaptive learning processes. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

It remains unclear why this is. One hypothesis is that relational features are highly diagnostic of object categories and emerge as a result of learning to classify objects. We tested this by analyzing the internal representations of supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to classify large sets of objects. We found that CNNs do not show the same sensitivity to relational changes as previously observed for human participants. Furthermore, when we precisely controlled the deformations to objects, human behavior was best predicted by the number of relational changes while CNNs were equally sensitive to all changes. Even changing the statistics of the learning environment by making relations uniquely diagnostic did not make networks more sensitive to relations in general. Our results show that learning to classify objects is not sufficient for the emergence of human shape representations. Instead, these results suggest that humans are selectively sensitive to relational changes because they build representations of distal objects from their retinal images and interpret relational changes as changes to these distal objects. This inferential process makes human shape representations qualitatively different from those of artificial neural networks optimized to perform image classification. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, we do not yet know whether this statistical learning effect is driven by biasing attentional selection at the early perceptual stage of processing, as theories of attention propose, or by improving the decision-making efficiency at a late response-related stage. Leveraging the high-temporal resolution of the event-related potential (ERP) technique, we had 16 human observers perform a visual search task where we inserted a fine-grained statistical regularity that the target shapes appeared in different colors with six unique probabilities. Observers unintentionally learned these regularities such that they were faster to report targets that appeared in more likely target colors. The observers’ ERPs showed that this learning effect resulted in subjects making faster decisions about the target presence, and not by preferentially shifting attention to more rapidly select likely target colors, as is often assumed by the attentional selection account, supporting a post-selection account for statistical learning of the probabilistic regularities of target features.

However, much research has shown that measures of contextual and semantic diversity offer a better account of lexical behaviors than WF (Adelman et al., 2006; Jones et al., 2012). In contrast to these previous studies, Chapman and Martin (2022) recently demonstrated that WF seems to account for distinct and greater levels of variance than measures of contextual and semantic diversity across a variety of datatypes. However, there are two limitations to these findings. The first is that Chapman and Martin (2022) compared variables derived from different corpora, which makes any conclusion about the theoretical advantage of one metric over another confounded, as it could be the construction of one corpus that provides the advantage and not the underlying theoretical construct. Second, they did not consider recent developments in the semantic distinctiveness model (SDM; Johns, 2021a; Johns et al., 2020; Johns & Jones, 2022). The current paper addressed the second limitation. Consistent with Chapman and Martin (2022), our results showed that the earliest versions of the SDM were less predictive of lexical data relative to WF when derived from a different corpus. However, the later versions of the SDM accounted for substantially more unique variance than WF in lexical decision and naming data. The results suggest that context-based accounts provide a better explanation of lexical organization than repetition-based accounts. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

However, conceptual analysis of existing recursive mindreading tasks suggests that conclusions about exceptional mindreading are insecure. Revised tasks were devised to provide a more rigorous test of recursive mindreading capacity. Study 1 (N = 76) found significantly worse performance at level-5 recursive mindreading on the revised tasks (17% correct) compared with the original tasks (80% correct), and no effect of moderate financial bonuses for good performance.

Word and picture norms for many attributes are available for thousands of items, but there is a contamination problem in experimentation. When an attribute’s ratings are varied, how the semantic content that people process changes is unclear because ratings of individual attributes are correlated with ratings of so many other attributes. To solve this problem, the psychological space that 20 attributes occupy has been mapped, and factor score norms have been published for the latent attributes that generate that space (emotional valence, age-of-acquisition, and symbolic size). These latent attributes have yet to be manipulated in experimentation, and hence, their effects are unknown. We conducted a series of experiments that focused on whether they affect accuracy, memory organization, and specific retrieval processes. We found that (a) all three latent attributes affected recall accuracy, (b) all three affected memory organization in recall protocols, and (c) all three affected direct verbatim access, rather than reconstruction or familiarity. The memory effects of two of them (valence and age-of-acquisition) were unconditional, but memory effects were only detected for the third at particular levels of the other two. The key implications are that semantic attributes can now be cleanly manipulated, and when they are, they have broad downstream effects on memory. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

But intuitive theories can also contain and reinforce dangerous misconceptions. In this paper, we take up the case of misconceptions about vaccine safety that discourages vaccination. These misconceptions constitute a major public health risk that predates the coronavirus pandemic but that has become all the more dire in recent years. We argue that addressing such misconceptions requires awareness of the broader conceptual contexts in which they are embedded. To build this understanding, we examined the structure and revision of people’s intuitive theories of vaccination in five large survey studies (total N = 3,196). Based on these data, we present a cognitive model of the intuitive theory surrounding people’s decisions about whether to vaccinate young children against diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). Using this model, we were able to make accurate predictions about how people’s beliefs would be revised in light of educational interventions, design an effective new intervention encouraging vaccination, and understand how these beliefs were affected by real-world events (the measles outbreaks of 2019).

Would people be more drawn to the sword if they knew that the discovery was intentional, or unintentional? The current research examines this previously unexplored type of biographical narrative—the biography of the discovery of historical and natural resources. We propose that unintentionality in the discovery of a resource can shape choice and preference. We focus our investigation on resources because the event of discovery is an inherent component in the biography of all known historical and natural resources, and because these resources are either themselves already objects (like historical artifacts) or are the building blocks of virtually all objects. Eight laboratory studies and one field experiment indicate that the unintentional discovery of resources heightens the choice of and preference for the resources. We find that the unintentional discovery of a resource triggers counterfactual thoughts about how the discovery might not have occurred, increasing perceptions that the discovery was fated, consequently driving choice of and preference for the resource. Further, we identify the level of expertise of the discoverer as a theoretically relevant moderator of this effect, finding that the effect is eliminated in the case of novice discoverers. It arises for resources discovered by experts with the rationale that unintentional discovery by an expert is unexpected, and therefore prompts heightened counterfactual thoughts. However, resources discovered by novices for which discovery is unexpected whether it is intentional or unintentional are preferred at equally high rates. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Accordingly, temporal explanations may help reasoners resolve temporal conflicts, and we describe four experimental tests of the hypothesis (N = 240). Experiment 1 provided participants with conflicting or consistent temporal information and elicited natural responses about what followed. Participants spontaneously provided temporal explanations to resolve inconsistencies, and only a minority of them provided more conservative, direct refutations. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that participants preferred temporal explanations over simpler refutations to resolve conflicts, and Experiment 4 showed that participants judged temporal explanations more probable than refutations, and thereby yielded a novel class of conjunction fallacies.

Yet, major open questions about the mechanism and scope of these predictions remain, making their implications unclear. Notably, people may be inferring their attitudes from externally observable cues (e.g., in the simplest case, their demographic information) rather than accessing them directly. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that, in past work, predictions have been obtained only for a small set of targets, attitudes toward which are demonstrably possible to infer. Here, in an adversarial collaboration with eight preregistered studies (N = 8,011), we interrogate implicit attitude awareness using more stringent tests. We demonstrate that people can predict their implicit attitudes (a) across a broad range of targets (many of which are plausibly difficult to infer without introspection), (b) far more accurately than third-party observers can based on demographic information, and (c) with similar accuracy across two different widely used implicit measures. On the other hand, predictive accuracy (a) varied widely across individuals and attitude targets and (b) was partially explained by inference over nonintrospective cues such as demographic variables and explicit attitudes; moreover, (c) explicit attitudes explained considerably larger portions of variance in predictions than implicit attitudes did. Taken together, these findings suggest that successful predictions of one’s implicit attitudes may emerge from multiple mechanisms, including inference over nonintrospective cues and genuine introspective access. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In their article, the authors question the view that once adequate deep, elaborate, and organizational processes have been induced incidentally, the intention to learn adds nothing further to the level of subsequent retention. Opposing this view, Popov and Dames conclude that intention to learn is always necessary for good memory performance and support this claim with the results of 11 experiments in which they find strong effects of intentionality using mixedlist designs in which all items are processed semantically but only half need be remembered later. The present commentary suggests that intentionality leads to selectively greater amounts of item processing and organizational processing of the to-be-remembered items in mixed lists, and that these further operations result in higher levels of recall. In light of this interpretation, the commentary argues for the validity of the original conclusion that retention is determined by the qualitative type of processing carried out on the items to be remembered, however that processing is induced. The commentary concludes by discussing various factors that modulate the effect of intentionality on memory and learning, and by suggesting a scheme that may aid the understanding of these effects, and serve as a framework for future studies. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

It is all the more intriguing, then, to discover that event segmentation can itself influence howwe perceive the passage of time. We demonstrated this using a novel “rhythmic reproduction” task, in which people listened to irregular sequences of musical tones, and then immediately reproduced those rhythmic patterns from memory. Each sequence contained a single salient (and entirely task-irrelevant) perceptual event boundary, but the temporal placement of that boundary varied acrossmultiple trials in which people reproduced the same underlying rhythmic pattern. Reproductions were systematically influenced by event boundaries in two complementary ways: tones immediately following event boundarieswere delayed (being effectively played “too late” in the reproductions), while tones immediately preceding event boundaries were sped up (being effectively played “too early”). This demonstrates how event segmentation influences time perception in subtle and nonuniform ways that go beyond global temporal distortions—with dilation across events, but contraction within events. Events structure temporal experience, facilitating a give-and-take between the subjective expansion and contraction of time. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

The present study compared the performance of 58 different outlier exclusion procedures (OEPs) using four huge datasets of real RTs.

Participants (45 older adults and 45 younger adults) watched a trauma film. Eye gaze, Galvanic Skin Response, peritraumatic distress, and emotion regulation were assessed during the film. Participants completed an intrusive memory diary over the next 7 days and follow-up measures of posttraumatic symptoms and emotion regulation. Findings showed no age differences in peritraumatic distress or use of rumination or positive reappraisal during film viewing. Older adults reported lower posttraumatic stress and distress from intrusive memories than younger adults at the 1-week follow-up, despite experiencing a comparable number of intrusions. Rumination was a unique predictor of intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms, after accounting for age. There were no age differences in the use of positive appraisal, and positive reappraisal was not associated with posttraumatic stress. Lower rates of late-life PTSD may relate to decreased use of maladaptive emotion regulation (i.e., rumination), rather than increased use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies (i.e., positive reappraisal). © 2023 American Psychological Association.

Nobes et al. reported much lower—though still substantial—increased risk to young stepchildren, and little or none to older children, particularly when they took the mislabeling of noncohabiting perpetrators into account. In his Commentary, Daly (2022) largely accepts this analysis, but does not acknowledge its implications for his own findings and claims. Nobes et al. also reported that controlling for father’s age accounted for much of the remaining increased risk, and argued that this and other confounding variables are likely to explain most or all of the Cinderella effect. Daly says very little about this too, but instead responds with a series of criticisms, many of which misrepresent Nobes et al.’s account, and most of which are incorrect.

This line of research has however been predominantly limited to very simple speaking contexts, typically involving (a) repetitive production of single words and (b) production of speech while alone, without the usual exposure to other voices. This study investigated adaptation to a real-time perturbation of the first and second formants during production of sentences either in synchrony with a prerecorded voice (synchronous speech group) or alone (solo speech group). Experiment 1 (n = 30) found no significant difference in the average magnitude of compensatory formant changes between the groups; however, synchronous speech resulted in increased between-individual variability in such formant changes. Participants also showed acoustic–phonetic convergence to the voice they were synchronizing with prior to introduction of the feedback alteration. Furthermore, the extent to which the changes required for convergence agreed with those required for adaptation was positively correlated with the magnitude of subsequent adaptation. Experiment 2 tested an additional group with a metronome-timed speech task (n = 15) and found a similar pattern of increased between-participant variability in formant changes. These findings demonstrate that speech motor adaptation can be measured robustly at the group level during performance of more complex speaking tasks; however, further work is needed to resolve whether self-voice adaptation and other-voice convergence reflect additive or interactive effects during sensorimotor control of speech. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

Participants completed three tasks that assessed: (a) the likelihood of making social inferences, (b) judgments about an avatar’s visual and spatial perspective, and (c) their ability to use an avatar’s visual perspective to assign reference in language. Results revealed that while the likelihood of correctly inferring others’ mental states increased linearly between adolescence and older adulthood (likely reflecting accumulating social experience over the lifespan), the ability to judge an avatar’s perspective and use this to assign reference was subject to developmental changes from adolescence to older age, with performance peaking in young adulthood. Correlation and mediation analyses incorporated three measures of executive functioning (inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) and revealed that executive functions contribute to perspective-taking ability in these tasks (particularly during development), but largely do notmediate the effect of age on perspective-taking.

One of the key claims about trait impressions from faces and voices alike is that these impressions are formed rapidly. For faces, studies have systematically mapped this rapid time course of trait impressions, finding that they are well formed and stable after approximately 100 ms of exposure. For voices, however, no systematic investigation of the time course of trait perception exists. In the current study, listeners provided trait judgments (attractiveness, dominance, trustworthiness) based on recordings of 100 voices that lasted either 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 ms. Based on measures of intra and interrater agreement as well as correlations of mean ratings for different exposure conditions, we find that trait perception from voices is indeed rapid. Unlike faces, however, trait impressions from voices require longer exposure to develop and stabilize although they are still formed by 400 ms. Furthermore, differences in the time course of trait perception from voices emerge across traits and voice gender: The formation of impressions of attractiveness and dominance required less exposure when based on male voices, whereas impressions of trustworthiness evolved over a more gradual time course for male and female voices alike. These findings not only provide the first estimate of the time course of the formation of voice trait impressions, but they also have implications for voice perception models where voices are regarded as “auditory faces”. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

Our experiments were motivated by well-characterized non-uniformities in neuron distribution in the human eye and early visual pathways. These non-uniformities have been extensively studied in the context of spatial perception, while largely neglected in relation to temporal perception. In Experiment 1, participants fixated the rapid serial visual presentation letter stream and were instructed to report the letter which appeared simultaneously with a brief cue presented at different locations along the horizontal meridian. Participants exhibited a tendency to report earlier letters with more peripheral as compared to central cues, indicating that they misperceived differently located stimuli as simultaneous even though they were never presented together. Experiment 2 conceptually replicated the findings of Experiment 1. Experiment 3 further demonstrated that the effect is specifically due to eccentricity, and not the relative distance between the stimuli.We argue that such location-based misperceptions of simultaneity arise because transient stimuli at more eccentric locations advance to perception faster than stimuli at or near the fovea. Collectively, these experiments show, for the first time, how processing speed differences across the visual field translate into differences in perceived simultaneity. They also demonstrate, for the first time, location-based misperceptions of simultaneity for stimuli never presented together. Finally, Experiment 4 showed that greater eccentricity also increased the perceived duration of a stimulus compared to fovea. These results reveal the breadth of perceptual effects driven by temporal processing differences across the visual field. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Here, an online referential communication task (RCT) was used in two experiments to examine whether the strength and type of common ground between dyads influence their ability to form and recall referential labels for images. Results from both experiments show a significant association between the strength of common ground formed between dyads for images during the RCT and their verbatim—but not semantic—recall memory for image descriptions about a week later. Participants who generated the image descriptions during the RCT also showed superior verbatim and semantic recall memory performance. In Experiment 2, a group of friends with pre-existing personal common ground were significantly more efficient in their use of words to describe images during the RCT than a group of strangers without personal common ground. However, personal common ground did not lead to enhanced recall memory performance. Together, these findings provide evidence that individuals can remember some verbatim words and phrases from conversations, and partially support the theoretical notion that common ground and memory are intricately linked conversational processes. The null findings with regard to semantic recall memory suggest that the structured nature of the RCT may have constrained the types of memory representations that individuals formed during the interaction. Findings are discussed in relation to the multidimensional nature of common ground and the importance of developing more natural conversational tasks for future work. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

This research proposes one reason that may underlie the observed ideological asymmetries toward COVID-19 prevention measures and boundaries in general: Conservatives and liberals may fundamentally differ in how they construe boundaries. Supporting this prediction, Studies 1a–1d and two follow-up studies (n = 3,231; Studies 1a–1c and follow-up studies: Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific users, Study 1d: U.S. students) demonstrate that identifying with political conservatism (vs. liberalism) increases the likelihood to construe boundaries as restrictions. We further show that, due to conservatives’ greater preference for order, structure-related words carry a more positive connotation among conservatives versus liberals (Study 2: n = 744; MTurk users). Capitalizing on this finding, we demonstrate that linguistic framing that highlights the structure-providing function of a boundary (e.g., a social distancing sign can “structure” customer flow in a restaurant) can reduce the salience of its usual restrictive aspect and hence effectively improve conservatives’ attitudes toward the boundaries (Study 3: n = 740; MTurk users). © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

We report a cross-sectional study that uses the competitive attention test to characterize patterns of attention across the adult life span from 21 to 86 years old. Several distractibility components were measured in 186 participants distributed within seven age groups. Results indicate that distractibility components follow distinct trajectories with aging: Voluntary orienting remains stable from 21 to 86 years old, sustained attention decreases after 30 years old, distraction progressively increases between 26 and 86 years old, and impulsivity is lower in older compared to younger adults. Increased distractibility in older age thus seems to result from a dominance of involuntary over voluntary attention processes, whose detrimental effect on performance is partly compensated by enhanced motor control. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

While we agree on many points, we maintain that in most situations the processes induced by the intention to remember are more effective than those induced by deep semantic processing alone.We show that effects of intent appear with a variety of tasks such as free recall, cued recall, source memory, item recognition, in both mixed and pure lists, and when studying individual words, word pairs, or word–image associations. Thus, the beneficial effects of intent generalize over tasks, list– compositions, and study materials. There are also little individual differences in the effect of intent in healthy young adults—most participants (86% out of 336 participants over six experiments) showa beneficial effect. We review evidence that the intent to remember strengthens item–context bindings in episodic memory, but that such effects could be masked and not measurable in subsequent memory tests, unless intrusions are taken into account. We agree that in principle incidental encoding could induce optimal processing, but we do not find the existing evidence convincing. We provide additional novel data that directly addresses Craik’s (2023) concerns and we propose ways to further investigate how intention enhances memory. We conclude with a joint statement, coauthored by Craik and ourselves, that synthesizes our converging perspectives and current understanding of the impact of intent on memory. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Memory distortions are often caused by our experience of what typically happens in a given situation. However, it is unclear whether memory for events is biased by the knowledge that events usually have a predictable structure (a beginning, middle, and an end). Using video clips of everyday situations, we tested how interrupting events at unexpected time points affects memory of how those events ended. In four free recall experiments (1, 2, 4, and 5), we found that interrupting clips just before a salient piece of action was completed, resulted in the false recall of details about how the clip might have ended. We refer to this as “event extension.” On the other hand, interrupting clips just after one scene had ended and a new scene started, resulted in omissions of details about the true ending of the clip (Experiments 4 and 5). We found that these effects were present, albeit attenuated, when testing memory shortly after watching the video clips compared to a week later (Experiments 5a and 5b). The event extension effect was not present when memory was tested with a recognition paradigm (Experiment 3). Overall, we conclude that when people watch videos that violate their expectations of typical event structure, they show a bias to later recall the videos as if they had ended at a predictable event boundary, exhibiting event extension or the omission of details depending on where the original video was interrupted. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

However, chimpanzees showed no developmental change in intertemporal choice, unlike humans, although younger chimpanzees did exhibit elevated emotional reactivity to waiting compared to adults. Comparisons of cortisol and testosterone indicated robust age-related variation in these biomarkers, and patterns of individual differences in choices, emotional reactivity, and hormones also supported a developmental dissociation between risk and choice impulsivity.

Furthermore, we find that this is because observers recognize that events far in the future are less knowable, suggesting that they may attribute accurate but premature forecasts more to luck than to skill.

They are not penalized for waiting until more information is known but may lose credibility if they make a prediction too early.

The current research interrogates a fundamental question about the boundary conditions of probabilistic learning by examining whether and how learning is influenced by preexisting associations. Across three experiments, participants learned the probabilistic outcomes of different card combinations based on feedback in either a social (e.g., forecasting crime) or nonsocial (e.g., forecasting weather) learning context. During learning, participants were presented with either task-irrelevant social (i.e., Black or White faces) or nonsocial (i.e., darker or lighter clouds) stimuli that were stereotypically congruent or incongruent with the learning context. Participants exhibited learning disruptions in the social compared to nonsocial learning context, despite repeated instructions that the stimuli were unrelated to the outcome (Studies 1 and 2). We also found no differences in learning disruptions when participants learned in the presence of negatively (Black and criminal) or positively valenced stereotypes (Black and athletic; Study 3). Finally, we tested whether learning decrements were due to “first-order” stereotype application or inhibition at the trial level, or due to “second-order” cognitive load disruptions that accumulate across trials due to fears of appearing prejudiced (aggregated analysis).We found no evidence of first-order disruptions and instead found evidence for second-order disruptions: participants who were more internally motivated to respond without prejudice, and thus more likely to self-monitor their responses, learned less accurately over time.

However, the features that make a task cognitively effortful are still not well understood. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed regarding which task demands underlie cognitive effort costs, such as time-on-task, error likelihood, and the general engagement of cognitive control. In this study, we test the novel hypothesis that tasks requiring behavior according to higher degrees of policy abstraction are experienced as more effortful. Accordingly, policy abstraction, operationalized as the levels of contextual contingency required by task rules, drives task avoidance over and above the effects of task performance, such as time-on-task or error likelihood. To test this hypothesis, we combined two previously established cognitive control tasks that parametrically manipulated policy abstraction with the demand selection task procedure. The design of these tasks allowed us to test whether people avoided tasks with higher order policy abstraction while controlling for the contribution of factors such as time-on-task and expected error rate (ER). Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that policy abstraction was the strongest predictor of cognitive effort choices, followed by ER. This was evident across both studies and in a within-subject cross-study analysis. These results establish at least one task feature independent of performance, which is predictive of task avoidance behavior.

Processing depth was manipulated by requiring observers to either distinguish numbers from other symbols (Experiment 1) or to classify numbers by either parity (Experiment 2) or magnitude (Experiments 3 and 4). Attention shifts occurred only after magnitude processing. Importantly, their direction depended on observers’ directional preferences for object counting, which was separately assessed in all experiments.

However, whether attention selection can be adaptively tuned to items that matched the context-dependent, relative feature of previously rewarded items remains largely unknown. In four experiments (N = 40 per experiment), we trained participants to learn the color-reward association and then adopted visual search tasks in which the color of a singleton distractor matched either the feature value (e.g., red or yellow) or feature relationship (i.e., redder or yellower) of previously rewarded colors. We consistently found enhanced attentional capture by a singleton distractor when it was relationally matched to the high reward compared with the low reward relationship, in addition to observing the typical effect of learned value on singletons matching the previously rewarded colors. Our findings provide novel evidence for the flexibility of value-driven attention via feature relationship, which is particularly useful given the changeable sensory inputs in real-world searches. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

In such situations, people face a dilemma about making individually costly but collectively beneficial contributions to the common good. Understanding which factors influence people’s willingness to make these contributions is vital for the design of policies and institutions that support the attainment of collective goals. In this study, we investigate how inequalities, and different causes of inequalities, impact individual- level behavior and group-level outcomes. First, we find that what people judged to be fair was not enough to solve the collective action problem: if they acted according to what they thought was fair, they would collectively fail. Second, the level of wealth (rich vs. poor) altered what was judged to be a fair contribution to the public good more than the cause of wealth (merit vs. luck vs. uncertain). Contributions during the game reflected these fairness judgments, with poorer individuals consistently contributing a higher proportion of their wealth than richer participants, which further increased inequality—particularly in successful groups. Finally, the cause of one’s wealth was largely irrelevant, mattering most only when it was uncertain, as opposed to resulting from merit or luck. We discuss implications for policymakers and international climate change negotiations. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

But what behavioral changes constitute evidence of learning? The standard approach is to infer learning based on a single behavior across individuals, including assumptions about the direction and magnitude of change (e.g., everyone should avoid falling repeatedly on a treacherous obstacle). Here we illustrate the benefits of an alternative “multiexpression, relativist, agnostic, individualized” approach. We assessed infant learning from falling based on multiple behaviors relative to each individual’s baseline, agnostic about the direction and magnitude of behavioral change. We tested infants longitudinally (10.5–15 months of age) over the transition from crawling to walking. At each session, infants were repeatedly encouraged to crawl or walk over a fall-inducing foam pit interspersed with no-fall baseline trials on a rigid platform. Our approach revealed two learning profiles. Like adults in previous work, “pit-avoid” infants consistently avoided falling. In contrast, “pit-go” infants fell repeatedly across trials and sessions. However, individualized comparisons to baseline across multiple locomotor, exploratory, and social-emotional behaviors showed that pit-go infants also learned at every session. But they treated falling as an unimpactful “pratfall” rather than an aversive “pitfall.” Pit-avoid infants displayed enhanced learning across sessions and partial transfer of learning from crawling to walking, whereas pit-go infants displayed neither. Thus, reliance on a predetermined, “one-size-fits-all” behavioral expression of a psychological function can obscure different behavioral profiles and lead to erroneous inferences. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Previous research suggests that learning from others might be a prominent strategy of adolescents to inform these difficult decisions. However, there is a gap in the literature that addresses the active role adolescents may have in gaining information about others’ behavior (i.e., social information search). Here, we investigated when and how much social information adolescents search before making decisions under risk and ambiguity, using a novel social search paradigm. In this paradigm, adolescents were able to reveal real information about their classmates’ choices before deciding on their final choice. Our two experiments suggest that social information search can be broken down in two independent decisions: first the decision to initiate search, followed by the decision to continue search. Several factors motivated initiation of search, including: (a) the difficulty of the choice, (b) uncertainty about the outcome, and (c) the magnitude of the reward at stake. Search took generally longer when adolescents faced information not in line with their initial preference. Finally, we observed that adolescents used the sampled social information to inform their risky-choice behavior.

Teodorescu, Lilach Yona and Baruch Eitam (Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 2020[May], Vol 149[5], 935-948). The authors report a confound in the analysis of the data. Correction of the error changes the results in Experiments 1 and 2 (see ANOVAs, t tests, and figures in Hemed & Eitam, 2022) but not the key theoretical claim. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2019-62255-001.) An important model for explaining humans' feeling of agency-the Comparator model-draws on ideas used to explain effective motor control. The model describes how our brain estimates the degree of control over the environment offered by a specific motor program (in short, an action's effectiveness). However, given its current level of specification, the model is at best vague on how (or even whether) the prediction of effectiveness of an action is dynamically updated. To test the issue empirically, our participants performed multiple experimental blocks of a task (reliably shown to measure reinforcement from effectiveness) in which blocks with and without action-effects (or with spatially unpredictable feedback) were interlaced. This design creates a sinusoidal-like objective increase or decrease in effectiveness (quantified as the n-trials back probability of receiving feedback), which participants were unable to report. As previously found, response speed indexed reinforcement from effectiveness. The results suggest that reinforcement from effectiveness is sensitive to both the degree and trend of effectiveness; that is, reinforcement is sensitive to whether it is increasing, decreasing, or is unchanged. Given the previous links made between reinforcement from effectiveness and the computation of effectiveness by the motor-system, the results are the first to show an online, dynamic and complex sensitivity to a motor-programs' effectiveness that is directly translated to its production. The importance of testing the so-called sense of agency in a dynamic environment and the implications of the current findings for a dominant model of the sense of agency are discussed.

We address this problem by developing a novel transdiagnostic and computational approach to eating restriction decisions. We first validated a novel paradigm which extends an established monetary risk task to involve body stimuli with psychosocial values. We used advanced behavioral data analysis of a large (total N = 539) sample of women from across the eating restraint spectrum, including those with anorexia nervosa (AN; n = 31), recovered from AN (n = 23), and subclinical women with varying levels of eating restraint (n = 485), obtained from an online experiment, public event, and laboratory-based study. We found that social and motivational values regarding body appearance have a significant effect on value-based, decision making in eating restriction. Subsequently, validated descriptive and predictive advanced computational modeling indicated that these behaviors are driven by an aversion to risk rather than loss, with desirable body outcomes being associated with less risk aversion, and undesirable body outcomes linked to greater risk aversion. These findings indicate that cognitive and social factors influence eating decisions by distinct mechanisms. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Scopus"

This position has been challenged by recent findings of similar divided attention (DA) at encoding costs on both specific and gist representations. However, the disrupting effects of DA on specific representations may emerge under less difficult DA conditions than those under which effects on gist representations emerge. The present study addressed this possibility by manipulating the difficulty of a concurrent DA task (low, intermediate, or high difficulty) during encoding among 176 young adult participants, who encoded face-scene pairs under either full attention or one of the three levels of DA. During retrieval, participants discriminated intact pairs from recombined pairs that varied in how similar they were to studied pairs. Results, interpreted using a multinomial-processing-tree model of specific and gist memory, showed that the disrupting effects of DA on specific representations emerged under less difficult attentional loads (intermediate-demanding condition) compared to those under which gist representations were disrupted (high-demanding condition). These findings reinforce the suggestion of differential attentional demands for specific and gist representations and also provide insights into attentional resource theories of adult age-related cognitive decline. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"

Although most prior work has focused on people’s personal mindset beliefs, a burgeoning literature has identified that organizations also vary in the extent to which they communicate and endorse growth mindsets. Organizational growth mindsets have powerful effects on belonging and interest in joining organizations, suggesting that they may be a productive way to intervene to improve individual and societal outcomes. Yet, little is known about for whom organizational mindset interventions might be more or less effective, a critical question for effective implementation and theory. We examine whether people’s personal mindset beliefs might determine the effect of organizational growth mindsets, and if so, whether this moderation reflects a matching or mismatching pattern. Three experiments manipulated the espoused mindset of an organization and found that organizational growth mindsets primarily increased belonging and interest in joining among participants who personally endorsed matching growth mindset beliefs. An additional field study provided ecological validity to these findings, replicating them with students’ experiences of belonging in classrooms. This study also revealed a divergent mismatching pattern on grades: rather than bolstering the grades of students with growth mindsets, growth mindset classroom contexts primarily enhanced the grades of students with more fixed mindsets. By clarifying for whom organizational growth mindsets are beneficial and in what manner, the current work provides theoretical and practical insight into the psychological dynamics of organizational growth mindsets. © 2023 American Psychological Association","Article","Scopus"
